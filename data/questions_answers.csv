"29 year old female, first seizure one month ago, lost the ability to speak. Babbled like a baby. Present deterioration of mental status.",See that? They all assume I'm a Patient because of this cane.
So put on a white coat like the rest of us.,I don't want them to think I'm a doctor.
You see where the administration might have a pRoblem with that attitude.,People don't want a sick doctor.
Fair enough. I don't like healthy Patients. The 29 year old female!,"The one who can't talk, I liked that part."
She's my cousin.,"And your cousin doesn't like the diagnosis. I wouldn't either. Brain tumor, she's gonna die, boring."
No wonder you're such a renowned diagnostician. You don't need to actually know anything to figure out what's wrong.,You're the oncologist I'm just a lowly infectious disease guy.
"Hah, yes, just a simple country doctor. Brain tumors at her age are highly unlikely.",She's 29. WhatEver she's got is highly unlikely.
Protein markers for the three most prevalent brain cancers came up negative.,That's an HMO lab you might as well have sent it to a high school kid with a chemistry set.
No family history.,I thought your uncle died of cancer.
Other side. No environmental factors.,That you know of.
And she's not responding to radiation treatment.,None of which is Even close to dispositive. All it does is raise one question. Your cousin goes to an HMO?
It's a lesion.,And the big green thing in the middle of the bigger blue thing on a map is an island. I was hoping for something a bit more creative.
Shouldn't we be speaking to the Patient before we start diagnosing?,Is she a doctor?
"Is she a doctor? No, but!",Everybody lies.
Isn't treating Patients why we became doctors?,"No, treating illnesses is why we became doctors, treating Patients is what makes most doctors miserable."
So you're trying to eliminate the huManity from the practice of medicine.,"If we don't talk to them they can't lie to us, and we can't lie to them. HuManity is overrated. I don't think it's a tumor."
First year of medical school if you hear hoof beats you think horses not zebras.,Are you in first year of medical school?
"Aneurysm, stroke, or some other ischemic syndrome.",Get her a contrast MRI.
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease. Mad cow?,Mad zebra.
Mad zebra. Wernickie's encephalopathy?,"No, blood thiamine lEvel was normal."
"Lab in Trenton could have screwed up the blood test. I assume it's a corollary if people lie, that people screw up.",Re-draw the blood tests. And get her scheduled for that contrast MRI ASAP. Let's find out what kind of zebra we're dealing with here.
I was expecting you in my office 20 minutes ago.,"Really? Well, that's odd, because I had no intention of being in your office 20 minutes ago."
You think we have nothing to talk about?,"No, just that I can't think of anything that I'd be interested in."
I sign your paychecks.,"I have tenure. Are you going to grab my cane now, stop me from leaving?"
I can still fire you if you're not doing your job.,I'm here from 9 to 5.
Your billings are practically nonexistent.,Rough year.
You ignore requests for consults.,I call back. Sometimes I misdial.
You're 6 years behind on your obligation to this clinic.,"See, I was right, this doesn't interest me."
"6 years, times 3 weeks you owe me better than 4 months.",It's 500. I'm going home.
I'm going home. To what?,Nice.
"Look, Dr. House, the only reason that I don't fire you is because your reputation still worth something to this hospital.","Excellent, we have a point of agreement. You aren't going to fire me."
Your reputation won't last up if you don't do your job. The clinic is part of your job. I want you to do your job.,"Well, like the philosopher Jagger once said, You can't always get what you want."
"Dr. Cameron. I'm sorry I have to stop you, there's a pRoblem.",You pulled my authorization.
"Yes, why are you yelling?","No MRIs, no imaging studies, no labs."
You also can't make long distance phone calls.,If you're gonna fire me at least have the guts to face me.
Or photocopies you're still yelling.,I'm ANGRY! You're risking a Patient's life.
I assume those are two separate points.,"You showed me disrespect, you embarrassed me and as long as I'm still work here you have!interrupted"
"Oh, I looked into that philosopher you quoted, Jagger, and you're right, You can't always get what you want, but as it turns out if you try sometimes you get what you need.","So, because you want me to treat Patients, you aren't letting me treat Patients."
I need you to do your job.,"Do the MRI, she folded."
Just get some rest for now.,"Told you, can't trust people."
"She pRobably knew she was allergic to gadolinium, figured it was an easy way to get someone to cut a hole in her throat.","Can't get a picture, gonna have to get a thousand words."
You actually want me to talk to the Patient? Get a history?,We need to know if there's some genetic or environmental causes triggering an inflammatory response.
I thought Everybody lied?,Truth begins in lies. Think about it.
"That doesn't mean anything,does it?","1252 PM Dr. House checks in, please write that down. Do you have cable TV here somewhere? General Hospital starts in 8 minutes."
"No TV, but we've got Patients.",Can't you give out the aspirin yourself? I'll do paperwork.
I made sure your first case was an interesting one.,"Cough just won't go away, runny nose looks a funny color."
Patient admitted complaining of back spasms.,I think I read about something like that in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Patient is orange.,The color?
"No, the fruit.",You mean yellow it's jaundice.
I mean orange.,"Well, how orange?"
What's that? What are you doing?,Painkillers.
"Oh, for you, for your leg.","No, 'cause they're yummy. You want one? It'll make your back feel better."
"No, 'cause they're yummy. You want one? It'll make your back feel better.","Unfortunately, you have a deeper pRoblem. Your wife is having an affair."
Your wife is having an affair. What?!,"You're orange, you moron!"
"You're orange, you moron! It's one thing for you not to notice, but if your wife hasn't picked up on the fact that her husband has changed color, she's just not paying attention. By the way, do you consume just a ridiculous amount of carrots and mega-dose vitamins?","The carrots turn you yellow, the niacin turns you red. Get some finger-paints and do the math. And get a good Lawyer."
"The carrots turn you yellow, the niacin turns you red. Get some finger-paints and do the math. And get a good Lawyer.",Deep breath.
Deep breath. It's cold.,Has he been using his inhaler?
What happened to your leg?,"Your doctor pRobably was concerned about the strength of the medicine, too."
What? The more often this happens!what?,"Forget it. If you don't trust steroids, you shouldn't trust doctors."
You couldn't have knocked?,"Steroids. Give her steroids, high doses of prednisone."
Inflammation of the blood vessels in the brain is awfully rare. Especially for someone her age.,So is a tumor. Her SED rate was elevated.
"That could mean anything, or nothing.","Yeah, I know. I have no reason to think that it's vasculitus except that it could be."
You can't diagnose that without a biopsy.,"Yes, we can, we treat it. If she gets better we know that we're right."
And if we're wrong?,We learn something else.
Parrots are the primary source of psitticosis.,It's not the parrot.
Psitticosis can lead to nerve pRoblems and neurological complications.,How Many kids were there in the class?
How Many kids were there in the class? 20,How Many are home sick?
"How Many are home sick? None, but!","None, but you think that 5 year olds are more serious about bird hygiene than their teacher. You've been through her home?"
She lives in Trenton. I can go up to her room tomorrow morning and ask her for the key.,Would the police call for permission before dropping by to check out a crime scene?
It's not a crime scene.,Far as I know she's running a Meth Lab out of her basement.
She's a kindergarten teacher!,And if I was a Kindergarten student I would trust her implicitly.
"Whoa, oh, I can't just break into someone's House.",Isn't that how you got into the Felker's home?
I should thank him?,"Well, I needed somebody around here with street smarts. Ok? Knows when you're being conned, knows how to con."
I should sue you!,I'm pretty sure you can't sue somebody for wrongful hiring.
But I'm pretty sure I can sue if you fire me for not breaking into some lady's House.,I'm doing research. People are fascinating aren't they?
Why are you giving Adler steroids?,"Well, she's my Patient that's what you do with Patients. You give them medicine."
You don't prescribe medicine based on guesses. At least we don't since Tuskeegee and Mengele.,You're comparing me to a Nazi? Nice.
I'm stopping the treatment.,She's my Patient.
It's my hospital.,"I did not get her sick, she is not an experiment, I have a legitimate theory about what's wrong with her."
With no proof.,There's nEver any proof. 5 different doctors come up with 5 different diagnoses based on the same evidence.
You don't have any evidence. And nobody knows anything huh? Then how is it that you always assume you're right?,"I don't, I just find it hard to operate on the opposite assumption. And why are you so afraid of making a mistake?"
Because I'm a doctor. Because when we make mistakes people die.,Come on.
Because when we make mistakes people die. Come on.,People used to have more respect for cripples you know! Turns to a guy in a wheelchair They didn't really.
Thank him for me. Right.,"Should I discontinue the treatment, boss?"
You got lucky.,"Cool, huh?"
"Given the latest symptoms it's clearly growing deeper into the brain stem. Soon she won't be able to walk, she'll go blind perManently, and then the respiratory center will fail.",How long do we have?
"If it's a tumor we're talking a month, maybe two, if it's infectious a few weeks, if it's vascular that'll pRobably be fastest of all, maybe a week.",We're gonna stop all treatment.
"Well, maybe we didn't see the effects until we started steroids.","No, it's not a tumor. The steroids did something, I just don't know what."
So we're just gonna do nothing? We're just gonna watch her die?,"Yeah, we're gonna watch her die."
"There's go to be something we can do, something better than watParkng her die.","Well, I got nothing. How 'bout you?"
I'm tired a lot.,Any other reason you think you may have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome?
It's kinda the definition isn't it?,It's kinda the definition of getting older.
"I had a couple headaches last month, mild fEver, sometimes I can't sleep, and I have trouble concentrating.",Apparently not while researParkng this stuff on the internet.
I was thinking it also might be fibromyalgia.,"Looks contemplative, and then serious Excellent diagnosis sarcastic!"
Is there anything for that?,"heavy sigh Ya know, I think there just might be."
"heavy sigh Ya know, I think there just might be.","I need 36 Vicodin, and change for a dollar."
"jumbled, I can't tell",Exam room 2. Places the bottle back on the counter.
Did you stab a guy in a bar fight? Nothing.,It's not a tumor she's getting worse too fast. She can't stand up.
Not that I could tell from her underwear drawer.,You said nothing that would explain these symptoms. What did you find that doesn't explain these symptoms?
"Yes, yes, her name is Rebecca. I call her Rachel.",You idiot!
You idiot! Hey!listen!,"Not you, him! You said you didn't find anything."
Everything I found was in interrupted,You found ham.
You found ham. So?,"Where there's ham there's pork, where there's pork there's neurocysticercosis."
Tapeworm?! You think she's got a worm in her brain?,"It fits. Could have been living there for years, it nEver occurred to me interrupted"
Millions of people eat ham Every day. It's quite a leap to think that she's got a tapeworm.,"OK, Mr. Neurologist. What happens when you give steroids to a person who has a tapeworm?"
Just like Rebecca Adler did.,In a typical case if you don't cook pork well enough you ingest live tapeworm larvae.
"Reproduce? There's only got one lesion, and it's nowhere near her bowel.","That's because this is not a typical case. Tapeworm can produce 20 to 30,000 eggs a day. Guess where they go."
Guess where they go. Out.,"Not all of them. Unlike the larvae, the egg can pass right through the walls of the intestines and into the blood stream. And where does the blood stream go?"
And where does the blood stream go? Everywhere.,As long as it's healthy the immune system doesn't Even know it's there.
"As long as it's healthy, so what do we do? Call a vet and nurse the little guy back to health?",It's too late for that.
It's only abnormal in 30% of cases. Proving nothing.,"No, no, no, no, you see, it fits, it's perfect! It explains Everything."
But it proves nothing.,I can prove it by treating it.
"No, you can't. I was just with her, she doesn't want any more treatments, she doesn't want any more experiments, she wants to go home and die.","To nurse Will you excuse us, please?"
"To nurse Will you excuse us, please?",I'm Dr. House.
It's good to meet you.,"You're being an idiot. Ahem. Pause You have a tapeworm in your brain, it's not pleasant, but if we don't do anything you'll be dead by the weekend."
Have you actually seen the worm?,When you're all better I'll show you my diplomas.
You were sure I had vasculitus too. Now I can't walk and I'm wearing a,"I'm not talking about a treatment I'm talking about a cure. But because I might be wrong, you want to die."
What made you a cripple?,I had an infarction.
A heart attack?,It's what happens when the blood flow is obstructed.
Wasn't there something they could do?,"There was plenty they could do, if they made the right diagnosis, but the only symptom was pain. Not may people get to experience muscle death."
Did you think you were dying?,I hoped I was dying.
"So you hide in your office, refuse to see Patients because you don't like the way people look at you. You feel cheated by life so now you're gonna get Even with the world. You want me to fight this. Why? What makes you think I'm so much better than you?","When you're scared, you'll turn into me."
I just want to die with a little dignity.,There's no such thing!
"There's no such thing! Our bodies break down, sometimes when we're 90, sometimes before we're Even born, but it always happens and there's nEver any dignity in it. I don't care if you can walk, see, wipe your own ass. It's always ugly, always. Pause You can live with dignity, we can't die with it.",No treatment.
"Maybe we can get a court order, override her wishes. Claim she doesn't have the capacity to make this decision.",But she does.
Pretty common result.,That didn't happen here.
"So because you respect her, you're going to let her die?","I solved the case, my work is done."
"I solved the case, my work is done.","Patients always want proof, we're not making cars here, we don't give guarantees."
"I think we can prove it's a worm. It's noninvasive, it's safe. I'm not completely sure but!interrupted","Yeah, yeah, yeah what's the damn idea?"
"Which is the same thing as a CT scan, which we did, which proved nothing.","Worm cysts is the same density as the cerebrospinal fluid, we're not going to see anything in her head, but Chase is right, he's right, we should x-ray her, but we don't x-ray her brain, we x-ray her leg, worms love thigh muscle."
Why did you hire me?,Does it matter?
Kinda hard to work for a guy who doesn't respect you.,Why?
Is that rhetorical?,"No, it just seems that way because you can't think of an answer."
You hired a black guy because he had a juvenile record.,"No, it wasn't a racial thing, I didn't see a black guy."
You hired me to get into my pants?!,I can't beliEve that that would shock you.
I was in the top of my class.,But not THE top.
I did an internship at the Mayo Clinic.,"Yes, you were a very good applicant."
But not the best?,"Would that upset you, really, to think that you were hired because of some genetic gift of beauty not some genetic gift of intelligence?"
I worked very hard to get where I am.,But you didn't have to.
Am I supposed to be flattered?,Gorgeous women do not go to medical school. Unless they're as damaged as they are beautiful. Were you abused by a family member?
Were you abused by a family member? No!,Sexually assaulted?
Sexually assaulted? No.,"But you are damaged, aren't you?"
Hold on. She's converted.,You said she was your cousin. Why would you lie?
It got you to take the case.,"You lied to a friend to save a stranger, you don't think that's screwed up?"
You've nEver lied to me?,I NEveR lie.
He says he needs a refill.,Got change for a dollar?
"Dan, Dan, get a doctor! Hey!",Close the door. Close the door!
Is Cuddy down the hall counting to 50?,"She's knows I'm in here, the clinic, as she comManded she just doesn't know I'm alone."
"Well, you've got a full waiting room, how long do you think you can ignore them?",I'm off at 400.
You're doing this to avoid 5 minutes of work?,"I go out there, I get assigned a kid with a runny nose."
"Yes, concerned parents can be so annoying. Just tell Cuddy you've got an urgent case, you had to leave early.",That would be lying.
"And that would be wrong. But luckily, the definition of urgent is fungible.",Not the definition of case though.
"You have no cases. You have NO cases. You've got handpicked doctors, specialists, working for you, and they're sitting on their hands?",Cameron is answering my mail.
Time well spent I'm sure. Foreman and Chase?,Research?
Huh Fills in the space,"So, 403 PM. Dr. House checks out. Please write that down."
Dr. House. from now on he'll just be called Dad,"Sorry, done for the day. There's plenty of docs here to take care of you."
But we had an appointment.,"Hah, nice try, but this is a walk-in clinic, which means there are no appointments."
But your letter says that we would see you.,Not a big letter writer.
Not a big letter writer. Here.,When did my signature get so girly?
I can explain.,"See that G, see how it makes a big loop on top?"
"It's impossible to get to you through normal channels, they have called!interrupted",PersEverance does not equal worthiness. Next time you want to get my attention wear something fun. Low-rider jeans are hot.
"16 year old male, sudden onset of double vision and night terrors, with no apparent cause. The kid's been to 2 neurologists!interrupted","Night terrors, yeah? As in big scary monsters?"
Where are you going?,To see the family.
You're going to examine a Patient?,"9 times out of 10 there's no reason to talk to a Patient, but night terrors in a 16 year old is a VERY good reason to talk to this family."
"9 times out of 10 there's no reason to talk to a Patient, but night terrors in a 16 year old is a VERY good reason to talk to this family. Good work.","Margins look fine. No lesions, color is good. How long have you been having night terrors?"
What does that tell you?,"Nothing, it's just fun watParkng him blink. To Dan Name as Many animals as you can that begin with the letter B go."
To Dan Name as Many animals as you can that begin with the letter B go. Baby elephant.,Baby elephant is actually a good answer B is a bear of a letter.
What does that tell you?,"Proves two things, no neurological damage, and your son is nEver going to be Parkef fry cook."
"In teens there are two likely causes of night terrors post traumatic stress, any recent shootouts at your high school? No.","Well, then, Dave!"
"Well, then, Dave! Dan",!if there's no trauma the other cause is sexual abuse.
We would nEver do anything to hurt Dan.,"I say it here, it comes out there. This lack of response is consistent with abuse."
"There's no one, ok? I swear. There was trauma I got hit in the head during a lacrosse game.",To Cameron Did you know that he got hit in the head?
"They didn't mention it, no.","Yeah, why bother."
"No, no, we took him to the ER after the game. He was scanned, they tested him, they said he was fine. No concussion, it's gotta be something else.","You hound me for my opinion and then question my diagnosis. Cool. ER obviously screwed up, kid's got a concussion."
I had double vision before I got hit.,"Well, that changes Everything, you need glasses."
"You enjoyed that. I brought a reasonable case to your attention, and you shoved it in my face just to humiliate me.","You're an only Parkld, aren't you?"
Why would you say that?,Everything is about you.
I'm not an only Parkld.,attention on Dan Interesting.
attention on Dan Interesting. What?,Don't move. Did I bore you in there?
"What? Ah, no, not, not really.",Are you tired?
He nEver sleeps! Of course he's tired.,"Right now, at this moment, are you tired?"
"Right now, at this moment, are you tired? No, no.",That twitch in your leg. Did you feel that?
His leg twitched. I don't see what!interrupted,"It's called a myoclonic jerk, it's very common when you're falling asleep."
"Respiration rate falls, and the brain interprets this as the body dying, so it sends a pulse to wake it up. So?","So, he's not asleep, he's awake. Turns to Cameron Admit him."
"So, he's not asleep, he's awake. Turns to Cameron Admit him.","I recognize that loopy G. So, what does the jerk tell us?"
"Nothing good, the brain's losing control of the body. Can't order the eyes to focus, regulate sleep patterns or control muscle movements.","A movement disorder, or degenerative brain disease. Either way this kid's gonna be picking up his diploma in diapers and a wheelchair."
"Maybe not that bad, could be an infection.","You wish. No fEver, no white count. Anyone think this differential diagnosis might be compromised because we don't have an accurate family history?"
I took an accurate family history.,You didn't Even take an accurate family. His father's not his father.
Why would you say that?,30% of all dads out there don't realize they're raising someone else's kid.
From what I've read false paternity is more like 10%.,That's what our moms would like us to beliEve.
"Who cares? If he got it from his parents they'd both be dead by now, can we get on with the differential diagnosis?",Fifty bucks says I'm right.
I'll take your money.,"Hit a nerve? Don't worry, Foreman. I'm sure the guy who tucked you in at night was your daddy."
"It doesn't necessarily have to be that bad. If we exclude the night terrors it could be something systemic his liver, kidneys, something outside the brain.","Yes, feel free to exclude any symptom if it makes your job easier."
That's a night terror. Parents said?,That's a good point.
I usually don't move during night terrors.,I'm not restraining you for them. EEG rEvealed abnormalities in your brain caused by nerve damage in your toes.
Whimpering What are you doing?,Fixing it.
Still whimpering Can I talk to my parents?,"Oh, they know all about this."
I'd really like to see them. Whimpering after pause Please! I'd really like them here.,"This is gonna hurt, Dan."
"We did a CT, MRI, CBC, Chem-7 and chest x-ray. All the tests came back normal. There's nothing to explain his symptoms.","Ok, but let's pretend there's something and go from there. Who sees something on this MRI?"
No space-occupying tumors.,"He's 16, so he should have an absolutely pristine brain. The smallest thing is abnormal."
Meningeal enhancement. My bet is viral meningitis.,"Excellent, you see what he did there? He took a small clue that there's a neurological pRoblem and wasn't afraid to run with it."
There's no evidence of meningitis on that MRI.,"No, there's not, he's completely wrong."
Then what clue are you talking about?,"He knew that I saw something on the MRI so he figured there must be something there and took a guess. ClEver, but also pathetic."
"So, what did you find?",Take a close look at the corpus callosum.
It looks ok.,"Are we all looking at the same thing? 200 million interhemispheric nerve fibers, the George Washington Bridge between the left and right side of the brain. It's subtle."
"There's some bowing, there. An upward arch.",Are you guessing?
Are you guessing? Yes.,"Too bad, you're right."
"He pRobably just moved, nobody stays perfectly still for their entire MRI.","Yeah, he pRobably got restless and shifted one hemisphere of his brain to a more comfortable position. Something is pushing on it."
If there's bowing it could be a tumor.,Do you see a tumor on this MRI?
"No, but I don't see any bowing, either.","There's no tumor, just a blockage causing pressure, causing symptoms. Today"
"No more pressure, Everything goes back to normal.",He's lucky to have you as his doctors.
"No formula, just mommy's healthy natural breast milk.",Yummy.
Her whole face just got swollen like this overnight.,"Mmhmm. No fEver, glands normal, missing her vaccination dates."
"Takes a toy frog and starts to make frog sounds Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit. Giggles",Think they don't work?
I think some multinational pharmaceutical company wants me to think they work. Pad their bottom line.,Mmmm. May I? He takes the frog and starts to do the gribbit noise with the baby
He takes the frog and starts to do the gribbit noise with the baby Whispered Sure.,"Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit."
"Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit. The baby laughs All natural, no dyes. That's a good business all-natural Parkldren's toys. Those toy companies, they don't arbitrarily mark up their frogs. They don't lie about how much they spend on research and dEvelopment. The worst a toy company can be accused of is making a really boring frog.","Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit."
Tell me what she has.,A cold.
There's a pRoblem.,Complications in surgery?
"Surgery went fine, he's in recovery, but we took a vial of CSF and tested it.",Really?
"Oligoclonal bands, and an increase of intrathecal IGG.",Which means multiple sclerosis. And the reason it takes three of you to tell me this?
McDonald criteria requires six months to make a definitive diagnosis.,"Oh, who cares about McPherson? I hear he tortured kittens."
I hear he tortured kittens. McDonald.,"Oh, McDonald. Wonderful doctor, loved kittens."
Without the lesions we can't be sure.,"Well if it is, it's gone from 0 to 60 in three weeks, which would indiCate rapidly progressive MS."
We should wait until we interrupted,"Start treating him now, he can walk for another couple of years, maybe live for another 5. Break it to the family. I'm going home."
I'm not here. Leave a message.,"Dr. Cuddy, great outfit."
What are you doing back here? Patient?,"No, hooker. Went to my office instead of my home."
"Dr. House, Dan's missing.","Yeah, I got that part from the message. You said I was needed immediately."
He shouldn't move after a lumbar puncture.,"I agree, he's gonna have a very nasty headache. That would also be my opinion if consulted tomorrow morning."
We wanted to keep you informed. He heard some pretty heavy news.,Sighs This is not a toddler wandering around a department store. He's 16. You'll find him. I'm going home.
"So, when you say Call me if you need anything, You mean, Don't call me.","No, I mean Call me if I can do something. I'm bad at search parties and I'm bad at sitting around looking nervous doing nothing."
What about his parents? Should we call them?,Why? You think they're hiding him? Make sure someone checks the roof some of the orderlies keep the door propped open so they can grab a smoke.
Dan! Dan! No!,Dr. Foreman. I assume you found the kid.
He almost walked off the roof.,Suicidal?
"No, he thought he was on his lacrosse field. Look, look, I was just gonna run home, shower, change!interrupted",Conscious?
Conscious? Yeah.,How'd you talk him down?
"Actually, Chase tackled him.",How come you didn't do it?
"Right, well, I am black, but he was closer.","Come on, you can ride up with me."
"Come on, you can ride up with me.",Anybody tell the family that their boy almost stepped off a roof? They must be thrilled.
"They're not suing, but I think only because Chase asked them.",Why does Everyone always think I'm being sarcastic?
Why doesn't he have MS?,"He was on the roof thinking he was on the lacrosse field, conscious, and therefore not a night terror. You want some of this? Asking Foreman about the coffee"
"Asking Foreman about the coffee Yeah, sure.","He was in an acute confusional state, which doesn't fit with a demyelinating disease like MS."
That the immune system is working.,"Right, he has an infection in his brain."
What about sex?,"Well, it might get compliCated. We work together. I am older, certainly, but maybe you like that."
I meant maybe he has neurosyphilis.,"Heh, nice cover."
"Sorry, RPR was negative.",We don't need a definitive test to confirm this.
"Sure, didn't need one to confirm MS.","Ok, let's wait for you to run titers on 4000 viruses while this kid's brain turns to mush."
"So the fact that he doesn't have MS is, it's really not good news after all?","Well, it is if it's neurosyphilis, the likelihood of a false negative on an RPR test, 30%, the likelihood of a 16 year old having sex, roughly 120%."
I'll start him on IV penicillin.,We're not going to wait for that. The most effective way to deliver the drug is right into his brain via the spine.
"We can't. In a cramped space like the brain, increased intracranial pressure from a high-volume drug like penicillin could herniate his brain stem and kill him. No neurologist in his right mind would recommend that.",Show of hands. Who thinks I'm not in my right mind?
Show of hands. Who thinks I'm not in my right mind?,And who thinks I forget this fairly basic neurological fact?
And who thinks I forget this fairly basic neurological fact?,Who thinks there's a third option?
Who thinks there's a third option?,"Very good, what's the third choice?"
"Sighs The Patient has a shunt in his brain. There'll be no increased pressure, we can put as much penicillin into his body as we want.","Excellent, inject him through a lumbar puncture."
"Sighs again, and then grunts in pain","Geesh. It's infected, with a really big hole like you stuck a nail in it to reliEve the pressure."
I wouldn't do that.,"Although the wound is irregular, not cylindrical, it's shaped like a triangle, so not a nail. Steak knife?"
Wife's nail file.,"Whispered Nail File. Yeah, pain'll make you do stupid things. Something to take the edge off? Takes out his pills and puts one in his hand"
Takes out his pills and puts one in his hand Yeah.,Cheers. Dry swallows the pill and Funsten eats his ewwwww Limps back
Dry swallows the pill and Funsten eats his ewwwww Limps back No.,Here on work?
"No, why are you interrupted",Does your penis hurt?
No. What? Should it?,"No, just thought I'd toss you a really inappropriate question. Your Lawyer's gonna love it."
Why would I want to sue you? I want you to treat me.,"You're from Maplewood, New Jersey. Right?"
Right? Yeah.,"Now, why would you drive 70 miles to get treatment for a condition that a 9 year old could diagnose? It's the free-flowing pus that's the tip-off."
I was in town.,"Not for family, not for work."
"Ok, you know what? Thank you, I'm gonna find a doctor to take care of this.","I didn't say I wouldn't treat you. We'll drain your knee, run some lab work, fix you right up."
Why would you do that?,I'm a people person.
You actually treated him?,"All I know is that he sued some doctors, who am I to assume that they didn't have it coming to them."
How's your hooker doing?,"Oh, sweet of you to ask, funny story, she was going to be a hospital administrator, but hated having to screw people like that."
I heard you found her on the roof.,You have very acute hearing.
You notify the parents?,"In due course, of course."
And is there a paternity bet on the father of the Patient?,Doesn't sound like me.
"Well, it does actually, but that doesn't mean you're guilty.",You think?
"I saw the parents in the lobby, smart money is obviously on the father.",Stage whisper My guy knows a guy who can get you in for $50 bucks.
"Fine. You tell your guy if I win, you attend the faculty symposium and you wear a tie.","And if I win, no clinic hours for a week."

That's why you came up with the brain talking to the virus thing?,"I panicked, ok? Sounded cool though, they bought it."
"I panicked, ok? Sounded cool though, they bought it.","Oh, crap. Another reason I don't like meeting Patients. If they don't know what you look like they can't yell at you. Aside to Wilson Here we go."

"Otherwise, do this. Dr. House?","Hey, Mr. Funsten! I was wondering when you'd be back. Got some papers for me?"
You've caused me considerable mental distress.,"I certainly hope so. Funsten hands him an envelope What? Too cheap to have your Lawyer serve it for you, or is it more fun this way?"
I'm obviously prepared to consider a settlement.,You have gonorrhea.
"No, I don't!","Well, maybe you're right, but I have a lab result that says you do."
You're just trying to scare me.,"It's reportable you know, public health issue."

We need an answer.,You idiots! You lied to me!
"You, on the other hand, accused us of molesting our son. Perfect.",Can we get off my screw-ups and focus on theirs? Theirs is bigger. You're not Dan's parents.
He was adopted. He doesn't need to know.,I do.
Adoption makes him just as much his interrupted,"Listen, when we were taking his medical history, were you confused?"
How did you find out about this?,I sampled their DNA.
We didn't give you any DNA.,Your coffee cups from the cafeteria.
You can't do that!,"Again, why are we getting hung up on what I did? Turns to Dan's parents Your medical history is useless."

Sub-acute Sclerosing Pan-encephalitis.,I know. There's only been 20 cases in the United States in the past 30 years.
I suppose you could make an argument that the kid's still in stage one. Once SSPE moves to stage two Interrupted,"Boom, stage two is universally fatal."
I assume it's impossible to tell when he might move into stage two.,"He's already started showing symptoms. It could be a month, it could be tonight."
Can we treat it?,Ask the neurologist.
We're not gonna shove a spike into his brain and drip interferon without confirming this diagnosis.,Tap him.
"We won't get a reliable result for measles antibodies in his CSF, not after Everything we've given him.",So the wrong treatment kills any hope of the right diagnosis.
"You can't order a $3,200 DNA test to win a bet.","It's not an actual cost. I don't know if you know this, but the hospital actually owns the sequencing maParkne."
"I don't know if you know this, but the hospital actually owns the sequencing maParkne. I'm serious.","Well, tell the parents to submit the bill to insurance."
Insurance is not going to pay for a bet.,It should.
"I will let you out of clinic duty for one week, after you pay the $3,200 for the PCR test. Whoo.","Well now, there's the $100 you owe me, there's the $100 I won from Cameron, $200 I took off of Foreman, and $600 I got from Wilson. Very bitter."

"He's sick, I care, I'm pathetic.","There are about a billion sick people on the planet, why this one?"
Because this one's is in our emergency room.,"Ah, so it's a proximity issue. If somebody was sick in the third floor stairwell that's who we would be talking about."
"Yes, I checked the stairwell, it's clear.","Ok then, emergency room guy it is."
"Wait, how was that so easy?",You know why.
Blood pressure's not responding to IV fluids?,"Yeah, that's just weird."
"Yeah, that's just weird.","CBC was unremarkable, abdominal CT scan didn't show anything. So, people, differential diagnosis. What's wrong with her?"

Really? I thought I was okay now.,"And yet, here you are. What happened? Paramedics took a week to respond to your 911 call?"
"You're not a very nice doctor, are you?",And you are very bad at whatEver it is you do.
You don't Even know me!,I know you're going to get fired.
I might be quitting.,If you were quitting you would have known that last week when your snot was still pale goldenrod you're getting fired.
I just don't like being told what to do.,I'll get you in for a full body scan later this week.
"They're having an effect. His BP's falling fast. Cut to a shot of Brandon coughing. There's fluid filling his lungs. His creatinine's rising. CG shot of the IV meds hitting Brandon's bloodstream. His kidneys are shutting down. Our treatment isn't making him better, it's killing him.","So, we had six symptoms that didn't add up to anything, now we have sEven. Who's excited?"
I don't think it compliCates things. The kidney failure was caused by the antibiotics.,Maybe.
"I thought that's what we dealt with, here. It explains the cardiomyopathy, pain, the low BP, the fEver.","You read the book. Impressive. It's a ludicrously long shot that explains Every one of those symptoms, except for the cough and the rash. Should we just erase those?"
"Well, anything can cause a rash.",Okay.
"If you're going to list all of the things it can't be, you're gonna need more colors.",Cameron was right. No condition explains all these symptoms. But orange and green covers Everything.
Occam's Razor. The simplest explanation is always the best.,And you think one is simpler than two.
"Pretty sure it is, yeah.",Baby shows up.
I think your argument is specious.,I think your tie is ugly.
We'll run the tests.,Tests take time. Treatment's quicker. Start the kid on Unasyn for the sinus infection and! what was orange?
What are you doing?,LEvel 4.
"No, I mean",I know what you meant. We're waiting.
My throat hurts.,So you said.
How long are we waiting?,Two minutes less then when you asked me two minutes ago. Cuddy walks in.
Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy. Nice to meet you.,"Dr. Cuddy, thanks for the consult. He closes the Gameboy. His throat seems to have some condition."
He has a sore throat.,"Of course! Yes, why didn't I! I mean, because he said that! it hurt, and I, I should have deduced that meant it was sore!"
I was in a board meeting.,"Patients come first, right?"
"Wouldn't want to prescribe a lozenge if there was any doubt about its efficacy, huh?","You once asked why I think I'm always right, and I realized that you're right! at least, I think you're right. I don't really know now, do I? Cuddy smiles."
Go home. Drink some hot tea. She leaves.,Excellent counsel.
"So, a Woman can't express her interest in sex without it being some professional powerplay?",No.
Men should grow up.,"Yeah. And dogs should stop licking themselves, it's not gonna happen. Chase comes in."
"Yeah, what are you doing here?",Looking for you guys.
Why didn't you page us?,'Cause I knew you'd be here.
Who told him?,"No one. I assume you're trying to prove my crazy two-illness theory wrong, so, obviously, you're going to be in the lab. You spin the urine? He pops a Vicodin."
He pops a Vicodin. Not yet.,Talk to me when you have.
Talk to me when you have.,What did you find out?
The kidney failure. It's acute interstitial nephritis.,I wonder if that's signifigant.
It means the antibiotics didn't cause the kidney failure. How did you know?,"Well, if you guys hadn't been so busy trying to prove me wrong, you might have checked in on the poor kid."
You visited a Patient?,"I was sitting by his bed all morning, just so he'd know someone was there for him."
I looked in on him. He's much better.,"Ergo, the treatment's working. Ergo, me right, you wrong."
That smugness of yours really is an attractive quality.,Thank you. It was either that or get my hair highlighted. Smugness is easier to maintain.
"I get that you're not a big beliEver in the 'catParkng flies with Honey' approach, but do you honestly think you'll collect a jarful by clEverly taunting them?","Flies, no. Doctors, sure. If I'd said to Foreman, Nice try, it was a great guess, but not this time, what do you think he'd be doing right now?"
I think he'd be going home not feeling like a piece of crap.,Exactly.
You want him to feel like a piece of crap?,"No, I don't want him going home."
How much longer?,"930, I figure she was on the 8th hole when I paged her!"
"I ran a TSH, T3 and T4. Patient's negative for hypothyroidism. Patient looks up. Not talking about you. She goes back to the Gameboy.",Well the fact that he's getting better would indiCate the unreliability of the tests.
"If I'm right and it's a viral infection, one of two things always happens Patient dies or the Patient's immune system fights off the invader. nods toward Patient What's with her?","Her leg hurts after running six miles. Who knows, it could be anything!"

"If I'm right, the antibiotics you prescribed could block his kidneys and liver, impeding his ability to fight off the virus. Could kill him.","Well, that certainly would be a concern. Fifty bucks? Patient looks up. Don't look away, the space monkeys will be all over you."
You wanna bet on the Patient's health?,You think that's bad luck?
Hey. House walks in.,"White cell count isn't up, is it?"
What if you don't find one? I can't stay here forEver.,The Patient could have died.
The one with the pulled muscle.,"Well, those symptoms are consistent with a dozen other conditions. I, you know, I, I'm entitled to a consult!"
You are not getting out of clinic duty.,"Oh, come on."
"No, I don't, but working with people actually makes you a better doctor.",When did I sign up for that course?
When did I give you the impression that I care? pause,Working in this clinic obviously instills a deep sense of compassion.
What's with you and her?,Don't.
Do you have a thing for her? The only people who can get to you,No!
Who's the Patient?,I am.
I am. You can't!,Dr. Wilson is the prescribing physician.
"Yeah. to House You will lie, cheat and steal to get what you want, but you're incapable of kissing a little ass?","Well, we all have our limitations. He grabs a bottle from the counter and turns to leave."
"House! Wrong bottle. He gives House the right bottle. Do me a favor. Take one of these, wait five minutes for it to kick in, and find Cuddy, and kiss her ass. pause","What was the kid's first symptom? small pause You did the history of his 800 symptoms, which one hit him first?"
"Ah, the cough.",Gout. He walks back into his office they follow.
"Gout? Uric acid crystals in the joints? The symptoms are pain, swelling, redness, stiffness! not one of which do I see on that board.",Because he doesn't have gout.
But he doesn't have gout. Why would he have gout medication?,Because you guys were right.
"But once he checked into this hospital he was completely in our control. Our food, our pills, our Everything. So Even if you're right, no gout medication. He'd either continue to deteriorate or he would have gotten better. But he got better, and then he got worse. It doesn't fit. It doesn't make sense.","Okay. Two people screwed up. Not as simple as one, but!"
He's resting he,I'm Dr. House. I'm your son's physician.
You're the one he hasn't met. How can you treat someone without meeting them?,It's easy if you don't give a crap about them.
When we checked in Dr. Foreman said,"Tuesday, he's getting better."
His throat was sore.,Page Dr. Occam. He's gonna want to hear about this.
"Sorry! He was coughing, and I just wanted to help him",I wish you would dare. Where are the pills?
It was just cough medicine!,"No, it wasn't. Where's the bottle?"
"Hey, I'm just a pharmacist, but I know what cough medicine looks like, Doctor.",It was so perfect. It was beautiful.
Beauty often seduces us on the road to truth.,And triteness kicks us in the nads.
And triteness kicks us in the nads. So true.,This doesn't bother you?
That you were wrong? I try to work through the pain,I was not wrong. Everything I said was true. It fit. It was elegant.
So! reality was wrong.,"Reality is almost always wrong. takes some Vicodin The cough medicine did something. Aggravated the condition. It's all over the place, must be in his blood."
What if it is his blood?,Lymphoma?
Unless you've got something better.,"Well, we foolishly ruled out lymphoma because his CT scan showed no adenophathy, CBC showed a normal diffen smear, bone marrow showed no"
Screw the tests. Do an exploratory laparotomy and find out what's in there.,"He has no blood pressure, no immune system and no kidneys. Surgery will kill him."
"Yeah, you're right. Let's stick with the wrong pill theory. pause",I'll schedule him for surgery.
"Yeah, but no surgery today.",How you doing?
How you doing? Okay.,Great.
I should go.,You think it's going to come out on its own?
How did you,"You've been here half an hour and haven't sat down, that tells me its location."
It's an MP3 player.,"has to digest this for a moment Is it! is it because of the size, or the shape, or the pounding bass line?"
What are we going to do?,looks at his watch I'm gonna wait.
looks at his watch I'm gonna wait. For what?,"Okay, it's 300, I'm off."
Brandon's not ready for surgery.,"Okay, well, let's leave it a couple of weeks. He should be feeling better by then. Oh wait, which way does time go?"
He crashed during prep. He's also experiencing pain in his fingers. I think some bug may have gotten in the clean room. I think we should double his dosage of GCSF to temporarily boost his blood cell count.,Pain in his fingers! right. pops a Vicodin
Pain in his fingers! right. pops a Vicodin,to Mrs. Merrell Hi again. He enters the prep area.
"Where's he going? House walks in without all of the prep Robes, air, etc.","Hey! How y'all doing? Interesting fact Every sEven years it's a whole new you. Inspiring metaphor, huh?"
"Dr. House, this is a clean room.","Yeah, I read the sign."
But we went to the pharmacy. We saw the pills!,ColParkcine does its damage in a very specific order.
"Then, the kidneys go, which is exactly what happened to!. Brandon.",Right.
"No, he's not!",Ecstasy?
"Twice, with Dan and Mike.",D'you know what they cut that stuff with?
Start!. Brandon.,Lovely name.
"I think you'll remember. You know, it wouldn't hurt you to be wrong now and then.","What, you don't care about these people?"
"Merrell hugs her husband, and then hugs Mindy. Big weekend?","It's not for me, I'm fully stocked."
Cuddy got you doing inventory?,Nope. Trying to solve that kid's case.
The gout medicine OD?,Yeah.
The fact that I know that it's a gout medicine OD would seem to indiCate that the case is already solved.,"Well, you'd be wrong."
"What about the fact that the kid is now, I beliEve the technical term is, not sick?",You know how Many forms of colParkcine there are on the market?
You know how Many forms of colParkcine there are on the market? Stop it.,"Neither do I, but it's a lot. Pills, powders, liquids, IV fluids!. Somewhere at a party, in his coffee, up his nose, in his ear, this kid had some."
"So, you're not happy with your Ecstasy theory?",He said he used it twice.
He said he used it twice. People lie.,"Yeah, but if you're gonna lie, it's"
"You know what, I'm not interested.",Not curious?
"No, because I'm well-adjusted. He walks off.",Right.
It's what we expected. The accident caused serious damage.,It's amnesia.

Flat or sParkling?,Flat.
Pediatrician'll take all the credit.,to Wilson Exhibit A Baby girl Hartig.
I'm still amazed you're in the same room with a Patient.,People don't bug me until they get teeth.
"Wow, that is amazing. You hung out in the OB/GYN lounge and heard about two sick babies. It's eerie. goes to touch something, I'm presuming a baby",Don't touch that.
confused All right!,We have an infection spreading in the hospital.
unbelieving These kids have totally unrelated illnesses.,"They fell sick within four hours of each other. They had the same delivery rooms, maternity rooms are neighboring, so transmission's possible. They have the same symptoms."
"The Hartig girl has a bowel obstruction. No matter how close their beds are, I'm pretty sure kids can't share a blockage.",What does bowel obstruction on a chart indiCate?
"Well, normally, I'd say it indiCates a Patient's bowel is obstructed, but I'm pretty sure you have some deeper truth to impart",It means that some random doctor of indeterminate skill thinks that the Patient's bowel is obstructed.
"trying not to laugh Okay, you're upset because they threw you out of their lounge.",Look at the x-ray. It's a normal gas pattern.
"You want, I can get you a key to the oncology lounge.",simultaneously Air. Air in the colon.
We're getting TiVo.,"If it's air, no bowel obstruction."
"Even if it is air, it could have been there before the obstruction.",No. Something's infected both these infants.
And you're the only one who put this together because!?,Because I'm the only one who looked at both kids. I want them isolated I want the maternity ward shut down.
Because you're better at reading an x-ray than a radiologist.,"Radiologists always over-read babies' x-rays, especially if they're asked to rule out a pathology. He read into it what he wanted."
Which is exactly what you're doing. You're finding a cluster because you think it's interesting to find a cluster. Two! plain old sick babies would bore you.,"See, this is why I don't waste money on shrinks, 'cause you give me all these really great insights for free."
"smiling Shrink. If you would consider going to a shrink, I would pay for it myself. The hospital would hold a bake sale, for God's sake.",We have an epidemic! Cuddy stops from going out the door and turns to House.
"slowly Two sick babies is very sad, but it doesn't prove an epidemic. She leaves. House is left alone in her office.",How Many do?
How Many do?,Get up! We're going hunting.
We're going hunting. For what?,Wabbits.
For what? Wabbits.,"Hi. pause Bye. passes the baby to Foreman, saying quietly He's screaming, he's fine."
"Good news, no epidemic. Tragic, huh?","looks at elevator Overflow rooms, third floor. goes into elevator"
We were just going to call.,Did he get hot all of a sudden?
"You'll be there very, very soon. elevator door closes, next line to House Happy now?",No. But I am interested.
No. But I am interested.,"Three sick babies, and a fourth showing early symptoms."
"Well, there's gotta be something in common.",Yeah. That would be the difference between an epidemic and a coincidence.
A needle in a haystack.,It's worse than that. We don't Even know what's the needle we're looking for. He starts to erase the whiteboard.
Then why'd you let her go do it?,"Because the hospital's her baby, and her baby's sick."
Spreading too quickly. House writes parasite on the board and crosses it off.,Next?
"And they're not responding to a cycle of avirarapovirin. If it's some other virus, we'll nEver find it in time, anyway. House writes a question mark next to virus.","Which leads us to bacterial infection. which he writes on the board It's not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics, so we've got something resistant. The usual suspects."
H-Flu. House writes these all down.,"Okay, those are the big ones."
We have an epidemic in this hospital and your tie is becoming a Petri dish. Put on a tie clip or take the damn thing off.,Lift up your arms. She does so. You have a parasite.
Like a tapeworm or something?,"Lie back and lift up your sweater. She lies back, and still has her hands up. You can put your arms down."
Can you do anything about it?,"Only for about a month or so. After that it becomes illegal to remove, except in a couple of states. He starts to ultrasound her abdomen."
He starts to ultrasound her abdomen. Illegal?,"Don't worry. Many women learn to embrace this parasite. They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes, arrange playdates with other parasites"
"They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes, arrange playdates with other parasites Playdates!",shows her the ultrasound It has your eyes. It's a baby!
But! that's impossible.,"Well, I assume you weren't getting your period. Maybe that should have give you an inkling."
But I'm on this birth control implant!,"Yeah, I know. I saw the scar on your arm."
!and my doctor said I might not get any periods at all if it was working.,Mm hmm.
"Um, Doctor? Please. Me and my husband wanted to have a kid soon, but! oh, God. Like four months ago we had this really big fight. House looks like he knows where this is going He moved out. I did something stupid.",One-night stand?
One-night stand? Ex-boyfriend.,"I'll schedule you a paternity test, too."
I can't let my husband know.,Does the old boyfriend look like your husband?
thinks a little Yeah!,Then just have the kid.
"Then just have the kid. He'll nEver know. The most successful marriages are based on lies. You're off to a great start. He leaves, Jill looks like she's going to cry.","Well, you look cheery. What's going on?"
And the urine tests show no casts.,Which means the antibiotics are causing the kidney failure.
I still think it's the pseudomonas. I vote to take them off the Vancomycin. long pause,There's no point in guessing. Take one kid off Vancomycin and the other off Aztreonam.
What the hell are you doing?,Theraputic trial to find the cause of the infection.
Theraputic trial to find the cause of the infection. That's wrong.,"We have four sick kids, at least. Who knows how Many more haven't started showing symptoms yet?"
We have a duty to these two!,If these two have different reactions we know how to save the rest.
So you're condemning one of these kids to die based on random chance. pregnant pause,I guess I am.
"So, you're going to flip a coin? That's how you decide which baby lives?",Can I borrow a quarter?
"Do you want to get sued, lose your license, House? Well, generally I'd applaud that, but my job is to protect this hospital, so I strongly advice you to come up with a medical rationale why Baby A should get Medicine X and vice-versa.","Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there, Slick."
Any medical justification. Doesn't need to be a good one.,"Well, Hartig sounds Jewish, so does Aztreonam, so we'll take the Hartig kid off Vancomycin, how's that? pause"
You can't experiment on babies.,Doctors experiment all the time.
On adults. With their consent.,Fine. I'll get the parents' consent.

She has a pRoblem.,"Yeah, she needs to deal with it. If you hadn't bailed her out, she would have done it."
"Great, then she wouldn't have slept for two weeks. Maybe she should be thinking about a different specialty. Lab work, research? Chase walks up.","Yeah, what is it?"
"The Hartig baby. She's getting sicker, too. The Vancomycin isn't working, either.",Vancomycin doesn't kill it. Aztreonam doesn't kill it. What the hell is this?

"No, the Lindpert boy had a bit of jaundice. He should be checking out today.","I want to test his blood, too."
"I want to test his blood, too. Why?",'Cause we need all the information we can get. The healthy kid can be our control group.
"All done, all done.",What did we get?
"Well, the sick babies all tested positive for Echovirus 11.",Great.
"And CMV, and parvovirus B19.",Three viruses?
"What's weirder, the healthy kid we tested he's positive for Echovirus 11 and CMV antibodies as well.","sighs They're infants. They have their mother's blood, their mother's antibodies."
So we just learned nothing?,Uh-uh. We have half the picture. The healthy kids survived because their mothers' antibodies saved them.
"The mom had CMV in the past she'd have the antibodies for them, the kid would be immune from it. So we test the sick kids' moms for Echovirus, CMV, and parvovirus.","And whichEver they don't have the antibodies for, that's what's killing their kids."

Why do you want to know? They get out of the elevator.,Why do you want to know why I want to know?
Why do you want to know why I want to know? Just curious.,"Me, too."
You don't get curious.,I'm the most curious Man in the world.

"Okay, all right! But, Dr. House, you've been so awesome. I mean, I really, totally trust you. Do you think you",No.
-- could do the prenatal?,No.
Or deliver the baby?,That would be no.
"No, it's great. Ethan and Karen start to laugh and cry.",They all gone?
Hartigs are checking out right now.,You look tired.
You look tired. Thanks.,It's no wonder. You've had a hard time the last couple of days.

Thank God these chairs are comfortable.,We are condemned to useless labor. House has a giant stack of charts next to him.
Fourth circle of Hell. Charting goes a lot faster when you eliminate the whole of classic poetry. House flicks a candy at him.,Writing down what we already know to be read by nobody. Pretty sure Dante would agree that qualifies as useless.
You're over two weeks behind on your charting. House flicks another candy it almost goes down Cuddy's shirt.,Oops. I missed.
"What are you, eight?",Could an eight-year-old do this? He makes a face. Wilson smiles.
You better stop or it'll stick that way. You have a Patient in Exam Room 1.,"Yeah, but see, see, I'm off at twelve and it's already five of."
She's been waiting for you since elEven. Cuddy walks off.,Melancholy without hope. Which circle is that?
Melancholy without hope. Which circle is that?,Hi. I'm Dr. House. What seems to be the pRoblem?
"stigmata. Shhhh, Pius!",You must be all the talk around the holy water cooler. You been washing a lot of dishes recently?
I help out in the kitchen.,Anything new in the kitchen?
I unpacked and washed them.,"Should have spent your time saving souls, it's easier on the hands. This is contact dermatitis you're allergic to dish soap."
Nonsense! We've always used that soap. Why is there a pRoblem now?,I've been a doctor for years.
"Thank you, Doctor.",You want some water? He hands her the pills.
I have some tea.,"Well, you just relax for a few minutes."
Still out by twelve.,How do you solve a pRoblem like dermatitis?
She talking to you?,I don't know. She's certainly looking at me.
"Oh, it's good to get a secular diagnosis. The sisters tend to interpret their diagnosis as divine intervention.",And you don't? Then you're wearing an awfully funny hat.
"Doctor, something's wrong!",Lift up your Parkn.
"He sticks the needle in her arm, CGI shot of the bloodstream going to her lungs, and the airways opening. What happened?",Did she take the pill?
Did she take the pill? Yes.,It's pRobably an allergic reaction.
She's allergic to an anti-allergy medicine?,You figure somebody's out to get her? How're you feeling?
How're you feeling? Better.,I'll put you on some steroids instead.
Is my heart supposed to be feeling so funny?,"It's called adrenaline, it makes your heart beat fast. He feels her pulse. But not this fast. to the others Get a nurse, please. Lie back."
Help! Somebody help us! House opens Augustine's shirt and listens to her heartbeat.,"Somebody get in here! A tech comes in. Call a code and charge up a defibrillator. She's got no pulse. The tech runs out, House starts chest compressions."
"You diagnosed the Patient with allergies and prescribed antihistamine, she went into respiratory distress, and you injected her with epinephrine. Presumably 1 cc.","0.1 cc. That is the standard dose, that is what I gave her."
People don't go into cardiac arrest from 0.1 cc epinephrine.,She must have a pre-existing heart condition that got exacerbated by the epinephrine.
It's too bad you didn't make a notation in the chart.,I can make it up right now.
"The drawer has syringes with both dosages, you could have easily reached for the wrong one.",But I didn't.
Everyone makes mistakes. This is why doctors pay through the nose for malpractice insurance.,"Relax, they're not going to sue. Worse they'd do is whack my hand with a ruler."
"And the discipline board? Are they gonna whack your hand, too?",You're going to report me?
What choice do I have?,"Uh, how 'bout not report me?"
"The eosinophils were mildly elevated, sed rate's up a bit. Could be looking at a systemic allergic response.",It's not allergic. Allergies don't cause cardiac arrest like this. Could be inflammation of the blood vessels.
Vasculitis? That wouldn't give you an elevated eosinophil count.,"Churg-Strauss vasculitis would. Blood vessels of the heart, lungs and skin become inflamed causing the asthma, rash and heart pRoblems. Covers all her symptoms. They reach the diagnostic office."
The lady just came in with a rash. House stops and stares at a bunch of candy canes on the table.,What the hell are those?
Candy canes. Foreman takes one.,Candy canes? Are you mocking me?
"No! It's Christmas and, and I, I, I thought",Relax. It's a joke.
"Yeah. Untreated only 33% of Patients survive past a year treated, five years.",Then I'd definitely suggest treatment.
"If it was any other attending doctor, I'd say that he made a mistake and gave her too much epinephrine.",pouring coffee Saying you wouldn't say it was my mistake is saying it was my mistake.
Everyone screws up your rule. I think you fit inside the subset of Everyone.,"I didn't screw up. Foreman shakes his head. Order a chest CT and start the sister on prednisone, 40 mg. TID."
TID. The sister?,"Oh, didn't I mention? The Patient's a nun. Sister Augustine."
Aw. I hate nuns.,thinks a little Who doesn't?
There is that.,If Cuddy thinks I made a mistake the least she could do is suspend me from clinic duty.
She doesn't confuse making a mistake with being incompetent.,"Oh, here we go. Lesson time. I recognize that confidence is not my short suit. I also recognize that I am huMan and capable of error."
So you might have screwed this up?,No.
"So, it's only a theoretical capacity for error.",Good point. Maybe there isn't one. Maybe that's my error.
"You know, most people who think as much of themselves as you do like to talk about themselves.","Most people don't like to listen, so what's wrong with you? He leaves Wilson standing in the clinic."

"No, then I","Next tried steroid enemas, oral corticosteroids, 5ASAs, 6 mercaptopurine! I'm impressed."
By my medical history?,By how well your last doctor charted.
"It's one thing to have to go to the bathroom Every hour, but when the kids sit on my lap, it's!. The store sent me home, they're gonna fire me. Can't you put me back on 5ASA? Maybe it'll work this time?",Not likely.
tries to read House's writing Cojorius?,Cigarettes.
Are you kidding me?,"About the looking cooler, yeah. The rest is true."
Isn't it addictive and dangerous?,Pretty much all the drugs I prescribe are addictive and dangerous. The difference with this one is that it's completely legal. He turns to leave. Merry Christmas.
Patient tested positive for herpetic encephalitis.,So what's that tell us?
"Ooh, I know! Prednisone compromises the immune system. Isn't that the medicine you gave her for the thing she doesn't have?","Yeah, but! hey. I'm think that's a trick question."
Are you hanging your diagnosis on an adverb?,In ten seconds I'm gonna announce that I gave her the wrong dose in the clinic.
You're gonna admit negligence?,Unless you leave the room.
"Sure, she was feeling better right up to the moment it almost killed her.","On the other hand, it explains the symptoms. Swollen hands, pulmonary pRoblems, cardiac pRoblems it all fits."
Except her ANA was normal.,So redraw the blood.
"But the treatment is corticosteroids, prednisone, and we can't go there because of the encephalitis.",Then we'll treat it with something that modulates the immune system but doesn't suppress it. Hyperbaric oxygen chAmber.
There's no protocol for putting a Patient in a high-pressure oxygen room to treat autoimmune pRoblems.,"Oh, you people."
"You are aware of the Hippocratic Oath, right?","The one that starts First, do no harm, then goes on to tell us no abortions, no seductions, and definitely no cutting of those who labor beneath the stone."
"Hyperbaric treatments could cause oxygen toxicity, lung and eye damage",Every treatment has its dangers
Which is why we treat when we're only convinced the Patient needs the treatment.,"I'm convinced. You're not. Question is, what are you going to do about it? Hmm?"
This is a chapel. A House of prayer.,"House of prayer, huh. That explains the good reception. Also why nobody's Ever here."
"I need to talk with you, Dr. House. Sister Augustine beliEves in things that aren't real.",I thought that was a job requirement for you people.
She's been known to lie to get sympathy. She's a hypochondriac.,"turns off TV So, you're warning me that I may be treating a non-existent ailment"
"Sore throats, joint pains! there's always something wrong, and there's nEver a reason for it. Mother Superior plays right into it. Lets Augustine off work duties, treating her as fragile, special.",That must make you angry. eats a piece of chocolate
It bothers me. It's not really in Augustine's best interests. She keeps looking at the chocolate bar.,offers the chocolate Want some?
I shouldn't. takes the bar and sits down next to House,"I guess you've got to be good at reading people to be a good infirmarian, huh."
around a mouthful of chocolate Mm hmm.,"So, we've got pride, anger, envy, gluttony!. That's four out of sEven deadly sins in two minutes. Do you people keep records of these things? Is there a Cathlympics?"
They say you have a gift.,They like to talk.
You hide behind your intelligence.,"Yeah, that's pretty stupid."
"And you make jokes because you're afraid to take anything seriously. Because if you take things seriously, they matter, and if they matter","And when things go wrong, I get hurt. I'm not tough, I'm vulnerable."
"I barely know you, and I don't know if I'm right. I just hope I am. Because the alternative is, you really are as miserable as you seem to be. pause","You know, from the way you're looking at me right now, I'd say you just hit number five lust."
Mixed connective tissue disease? Her ANA is barely elevated!,"Well, thanks for checking up on her. Good to know you've got my back."
"0-2 stat is down to 83, pulmonary pRoblems, breathing pRoblems",Irritation from the oxygen is typical.
She comes in with a rash and you put her into cardiac arrest.,"That well just nEver runs dry, does it? If there was no underlying pRoblem, then why is she still having the rapid heartrate?"
Maybe from the herpetic encephalitis caused by you giving her prednisone!,"Her reaction is a symptom, not an error."
"There's always an explanation, isn't there?","Yes, there is! And if this one doesn't work will find another."
But nEver one involving you screwing up.,One that fits all the facts.
"Can't get enough of this place, huh?",Came for my stethoscope.
"So, I shouldn't read too much into the fact that you were looking for it in the drawer with the epinephrine syringes in it?","Okay, yeah. I'd like to clear my reputation."
"Oh, right. I forgot that you care about what people think. Prescribing cigarettes for inflammatory bowel? It could cause lung cancer, you know.","leaving the exam room You know why they have ribbons for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and not for lung cancer?"
They ran out of colors?,It's because people blame lung cancer Patients.
"Huh. Well, guilt does a lot of damage.",You said that with great significance.
You're not here to find your stethoscope. You're not here to clear your reputation. You're here because you're having doubts. You might have screwed up.,"I'm here because, if I'm right, Cuddy is killing that Patient."
"Okay, but if you're wrong? pause",Then she's saving her.
My mother's been dead for 10 years.,But she's always with you in spirit. What do you know about the nun?
What do you know about the nun? Which one?,"The cute one. I think she likes me. The sick one, obviously."
Her parents died when she was a Parkld and she's been with the Church Ever since.,What's she lying about?
Why do you say that?,"I always say that. And the old nun says the sick nun is a big fat nun liar. You know nuns, what do you think?"
I don't know nuns.,You hate nuns. You can't hate someone if you don't know them.
Know any Nazis? Maybe I hate them on principle.,I have a theory on what makes good boys good.
"I think if she did have a secret, her boss would know. He leaves.","Did you paint, or put in new carpets recently?"
"Did you paint, or put in new carpets recently? No.",Any way she could have got access to drugs?
"Well, we lock all of our medications in the infirmary, and we don't keep prescription drugs here. Nun is making tea. Why haven't you asked Sister Augustine about these things directly?",I've found that when you want to know the truth about someone that someone is pRobably the last person you should ask.
Ah. And have you been speaking to Sister Eucharist?,She ratted out her fellow sister pretty quickly. If I were you I'd have her repeat a year of nun school. Nun chuckles.
Becoming a nun doesn't make you a saint.,Becoming a doctor doesn't make you a healer.
Just because we live in a monastery and we spend most of our time in prayer doesn't mean we don't find time for drama.,"So, what is the sick one's drama?"
Sister Augustine lived in Catholic foster care until she came to us. kettle whistles Tea?,Sure.
We consider that our life begins when we put on our habits and take our vows. What happens before then,"Is irrelevant to you, but it's relevant to me."
"Sister Augustine went into foster care when she was six years old, but she left when she was twelve. She lived on the streets, she got into drugs. When she was fifteen, she became pregnant, tried to self-abort. She lost the Parkld, she became ill. We took her in when she came back. If we had thought it was medically relevant we would have told you.","It's not. He takes a sip of tea, then looks at it. This tea is delicious. Local herbs?"
"Of course he might be right! It might be the Hand of God at work. Don't say it's something else unless you've got something concrete to offer. A teabag is thrown onto Cuddy's paperwork, she picks it up and stares at the entering House. What's this, hemlock?",I'm going to do you the biggest favor one doctor can do another.
"Still, what the hell, it tastes great. Sister Augustine","Has been drinking it religiously, so to speak."
Take the cardiac arrest out of the equation!,All the rest of the symptoms can be explained by a sEvere long-term allergic reaction.
That's what Cameron said in the beginning.,"Yes, she did."
"Damned if you do, damned if you don't.","Because it's been untreated for so long, it's gone from a simple watery eyes, scratchy throat allergy to a whopping I'm-gonna-kick-your-ass allergy, compromising her immune system, diminishing her ability to heal and breaking down her organs systems."
The dish soap.,"No, symptoms persisted days after the dishwashing episode. It's gotta be something she's been exposed to here in the hospital as well as the monastery."
"Well, what about the tea? It caused her arrhythmia.","Could be, but it's not definitive."
Get her in a clean room.,Okay. And we'll gradually introduce allergens and see how she responds. When she reacts to something we'll know that's what killing her.
It's a clean room!,How do you get an allergic reaction in a clean room?
Maybe it was the preservatives in the IV?,Checked that.
Checked that. Latex tubing?,Checked that. Checked Everything.
"Well, it could be mast-cell leukemia. It can cause anaphylaxis.",Checked the blood lEvels. And it's not eosinophilia or idiopathic anaphylasix.
Maybe it's just divine will.,It's not my will. takes a couple of Vicodin
"You do realize if you're wrong, about the big picture that is, you're going to burn, right?","What do you want me to do? Accept it, pack it in?"
Yeah. I want you to accept that sometimes Patients die against all reason. Sometimes they get better against all reason.,"No, they don't. We just don't know the reason."
I just wanted to say that I know that you did Everything you could.,"I don't need verification from you to know that I'm doing my job well. That's your pRoblem, not mine."
I was just being nice.,"Yeah, well, you don't need to always do that. pause"
Sister Augustine's been extubated.,Good.
She's requested to check out against medical advice. She wants to go back to the monastery.,"Well, talk her out of it."
I think I may have talked her into it.,Room's paid up for the rest of the week. You might as well stick around.
"This illness is a test of my faith. If it's His will to take me, it doesn't matter where I am. I can accept that.",Does anybody beliEve anything you say?
Why is it so difficult for you to beliEve in God?,What I have difficulty with is the whole concept of belief. Faith isn't based on logic and experience.
"I experience God on a daily basis, and the miracle of life all around. The miracle of birth, the miracle of love. He is always with me.",Where is the miracle in delivering a crack-addicted baby?
Are you trying to talk me out of my faith?,"You can have all the faith you want in spirits and the afterlife, and heaven and hell, but when it comes to this world, don't be an idiot."
I don't beliEve He is inside me and is going to save me. I beliEve He is inside me whether I live or die.,Then you might as well live. You've got a better shot betting on me than on Him.
How'd it go?,She has God inside her. It would have been easier to deal with a tumor.
Maybe she's allergic to God.,We looked Everywhere for an allergen that could be causing this reaction except one place inside her.
On her medical history she didn't mention any surgery.,She had one.
Can we get her records? What hospital was it at?,She didn't have it at a hospital. Order a full body scan.
What if she refuses?,Tell her I'm looking for a miracle.
Oh my God!,"The copper cross, a form of birth control pulled off the market in the 80s."
"So, she's allergic to copper.","Rare, but it happens."
Wouldn't she know she had an IUD?,"She had an abortion. IUD must have been left in, embedded in the endometrial tissue where it couldn't be detected."

"God, we must be fun at parties.",I think we both know the flaw in that theory.
How's the Sister?,"Kidneys functioning, heart rate is normal. You know how it is with nuns you take out their IUDs and they bounce right back."
You know how it is with nuns you take out their IUDs and they bounce right back. Great.,Told you I didn't screw up.
You screwed up.,I gave her 0.1 cc of epinephrine.
"Yeah, and if Cuddy hadn't taken you off the case, you would have killed her. small pause You want to come over for Christmas dinner?",You're Jewish.
"Yeah, Hanukkah dinner. What do you care? It's food, it's people.",No thanks.
Maybe I'll come to your place.,Your wife doesn't mind being alone at Christmas?
"I'm a doctor, she's used to being alone. House raises his eyebrows. I don't want to talk about it.",quickly Neither do I. Cuddy enters.

"As for the immobility, well, she's real active right now, of course paranoia keeps her limber. Paranoia?",Oh yeah she's sParkzophrenic.
Do we include sParkzophrenia in the differential for DVT? Well!,The answer is no. Abnormal dopaminergic pathways in the brain do not cause blood clots. SParkzophrenia is not the cause of DVT.
The answer is no. Abnormal dopaminergic pathways in the brain do not cause blood clots. SParkzophrenia is not the cause of DVT.,"On the other hand, we don't really know anything about sParkzophrenia, so maybe it is connected."

The tremors aren't new she must always cut herself.,Exactly.
"If it's a reuben, that's the way he likes it.","Everyone, this is Luke."

"I was going through your mail, and it was on a form. Happy birthday.",Oh.
No no no no no no !!,"entering exam room Well, good news, the lab says it's not strep, so we're done."
Wait a second!,"No, really, not strep."
The other kids hate it!,This is why you're here.
Sugar is the leading cause of obesity in America.,You want a doctor to scare her about the dangers of sugar.
She needs to get her weight under control.,"closes door Well, you know!"
That's not fair.,"Oh, yes it is."
You drugged her.,"Actually, I didn't. I've taken her off all medications."
"Your guy, Foreman, gave her Haldol.",We needed blood for some tests. I assume that was the only way to get it.
He knocked her out.,"Look I have a cane, and I know how to use it."
I hired you. You work for me.,"OK, can I go now? Boss? walks away"
"running for the door Help! Somebody, help!","So, when I said, no psych meds, I'm just curious which word didn't you understand?"
The Haldol had nothing to do with the bleed. You know that. I used it purely as a chemical restraint.,"Oh, great, well, that's good to hear. So she won't experience any of those pesky little side effects you get when your motives AREN'T pure."
Those side effects are so rare!,"Passing out, increased confusion, depression, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna screw up our diagnosis, 'cause you just used it to restrain her. I'm so reliEved!"
She spit in my face!,It must have been so frightening for you.
What was I supposed to do? Tie her down?,Yeah! Anything but give her drugs that's basically my point!
"If it'd happened at home, she would have died. That ER doc, he was gonna send her home.","It turns out your best judgment is not good enough. Here's an idea next time, use mine."
I think they're choosing a movie.,Why did the Patient bleed out?
The clotting studies so far are normal.,"Well, cover your ears if you don't want me to spoil the ending. Everything was normal, except for prolonged PT time, which means what?"
"Usually it means, whoEver drew the blood didn't do it right.","Oh, that's right 'cause! you drew the blood. But you were precise, because you knew the tube was purely for the PT study."
"But you were precise, because you knew the tube was purely for the PT study. That's right.",And I'm right with you.
Vitamin K would explain the bleed but not the clot.,"Without vitamin K, protein C doesn't work. Without protein C, she clots. Clotting and thinning, all at the same time."
"What about another drug interacting with heparin, an antibiotic like ampicillin? That would !","ClEver, but she's not on ampicillin."
"looking at notes Two months ago, she complained of a sore throat. And he got her ampicillin.",Which she refused to take.
It's more likely than malnourishment. Why not scurvy or the plague?,"Gee, I wish my idea was as cool and with it as yours. What is yours, by the way? Do you have one?"
"Alcohol. Simple. It causes immobility, which explains the DVT. It also causes cirrhosis which explains the bleed and the prolonged PT time. Let's ultrasound the liver.","Three theories. Check out her place for ampicillin and diet, then ultrasound her liver. Let's find out who's right before she bleeds to death."
That's the only thing she'll eat.,"Ah. PRoblem is, you can't actually live on this stuff."
"I checked it out, I looked on the box, all the nutritional values were solid.","Yeah, vitamin A and C, but no K. That's why your mom got sick."
"So, what's the plan?",Load her up with vitamin K.
Load her up with vitamin K. That's it?,"If it all checks out, you can take her home in a couple of days. Oh God, you're upset about something. You're gonna open to me now, aren't you?"
It's all my fault.,Here we go!.
"Shut up! I'm 18, I should be able to take care of my mom! I almost killed her.","Good example, just the time it takes to express those ridiculous self-centered teenage ideas! I don't envy your schedule. chomps No pickles."

"Before she got sick, I didn't like how bossy she was, always telling me what to do, the right way to do it. NEver thought I'd miss that. lifting backpack, wrist pain Ah!",You should get that looked at.
No way vitamin K's the whole story.,"putting up x-ray on lightbox It's not broken. pointing See this right here? It's the epiphyseal plate, otherwise known as the growth plate."

Last week. I was fifteen last week.,walking over to his desk and sitting down Happy birthday to both of us.
"Great. Thanks for the tip. takes out notebook Now, when I bring my mom home, is there anything I need to know about taking care of her?",I suppose your biggest worry isn't the booze.
They'd put her someplace too. My life is working.,"Not the word I'd use. Most 15 year old kids are doing what they're supposed to be doing, you know, they're huffing glue, catParkng crabs!"

Mickey Mantle had a whole bar named after him. He got a transplant.,"Yeah, well, Lucy can't switch-hit. Plan B. Surgery to resect the tumor."
He has no discretion. Five point eight centimeters is past the surgical guidelines.,Would he do it at 4.6?
"Why don't we just say it's zero, then we don't need him at all. Tumors grow, they don't shrink.",This one does.
"Good morning, Dr. House!","Good morning, Dr. Cuddy! Love that outfit. Says, I'm professional, but I'm still a Woman. Actually, it sorta yells the second part."
"Yeah, and your big cane is real subtle too.",Gotta go. walks away Those running noses aren't just gonna start walking on their own.

You shrunk the tumor!,Only way to get the guy to do the surgery!
Fraud! Fraud was the only way. There is a reason that we have these guidelines.,"I know to save lives. Specifically doctors' lives, and not just their lives but their lifestyles. Wouldn't wanna operate on anyone really sick they might die and spoil our stats."
Bergen has a right to know what he is operating on.,"True. I got all focused on her right to live, and forgot. You do what you think is right."
You really didn't know.,No. I didn't. And frankly I'm angry. Which I'm guessing is the correct response. 'Course I'll know better once you tell me what you're talking about.
'Course I'll know better once you tell me what you're talking about. Your birthday.,Oh.
It's a birthday. It's an excuse to be happy. You think that's lame?,Why are you here? To buy me a pony?
I'm just waiting for the surgery.,"Yeah well, go scrub in."
Cuddy didn't say anything about pushing Bergen to finish the surgery?,Not a word. Some kind of mind game. She's waiting for me to crack.

Are you questioning my ability to take a history? House just looks at her What's the primary--,Not what?. Why?
Diseases don't have motives.,"No, but doctors do. Why this Patient, what interests you? Give me the chart."
Give me the chart. Why?,I find your interest interesting.
What's interesting about that? Hypersomnia is usually accompanied by irritability in depressed Patients.,"True, but not relevant. She's not depressed."
Hello! She's sleeping 18 hours a day!,FEver. Clinical depression does not cause fEver.
She could be sick and depressed?,"She's sick! Dammit, why didn't I think of that?"
Hypersomnia and personality changes point toward the brain.,"Not the spleen. Thank goodness we hired a neurologist! Brain symptoms! hmm, could this be a brain pRoblem?"
You mean she claims she's nEver been outside the U.S.,Very good.
"Doesn't matter, blood and c-sub smears show no sign of parasites.",Has to be a tumor then.

Do they look real?,They look! pretty damn good.
They were a present for my husband's 40th . I figured he'd enjoy them more than a sweater.,That's so sweet.
Well. That's what breasts look like.,Is a lie a lie if Everybody knows it's a lie?
"Well, if a tree pretends to fall in a forest! House, come on, they're breasts. They're a birthday present, not a philosophical treatise.","Lie number one, she did not do that for her husband, she did that for herself. She thinks if she looks different, she'll be different."

You're ordering tests to cover your lechery. Interesting.,Very tricky case. to Wilson You love Everybody. That's your pathology.
A small glioma could hide from contrast. We could do a PET scan.,"Yes, that's how a responsible doctor would waste his time in the situation."
Suddenly tests and radiologists aren't capable of error?,"A glioma not presenting on a contrast MRI would have to be smaller than a grain of sand, which does not a gravely ill person make."
Late stage Lyme Disease can cause seizures.,Does the husband care about her?
He hasn't left her bedside.,Now way! it also means she doesn't have Lyme Disease.
What? Love conquers all?,Lyme Disease initially presents with a rash. Mr. Clingy would have noticed.
Did you look at her breasts?,Pff. Men.
Could be paraneoplastic.,She have any family history of breast cancer?
Her mother died of it.,"to Foreman The brain, but not the brain. ClEver, huh?"
A lot has changed since your mom died. Don't worr-- don't give up.,No tumor?
And how do you treat it if there's no tumor?,"You don't. Those twelve percent, no treatment. They were too busy looking for the tumor, right till they put the Patient in the ground."
What choice do we have?,Treat the symptoms. IV Immunoglobulin
So we're just going to ignore the tumor?,Eventually it'll get bigger. Then it'll be really easy to find. One of you needs to check out where she works.
One of you needs to check out where she works. Why?,Cause the husband's not sick.
"If it's not paraneoplastic and it is a reaction to some sort of toxin, it's obviously not coming from their home.","Foreman, you do it."
Why are you riding me?,It's what I do! has it gotten worse lately?
Yeah. Seems to me.,Really. Well that rules out the race thing. Cause you were just as black last week.
We had to sedate her.,You gave sedatives to a Patient who's already sleeping 18 hours a day?
It was better than letting her scratch all the skin off her arms.,Where's Wilson?
Onset immediately after IVIG isn't.,There is a simple explanation. Maybe she really has bugs under her skin.
Maybe she really has bugs under her skin. Infection?,That's what the worsening of symptoms after immunotherapy would suggest.
Blood cultures and the timeline rule out most bacteria.,If a Patient throws up on your shoes do you clean up most of it?
"The symptoms rule out the rest. Serology rules out viruses, CSS smears rule out parasites.",In the final stage of African Trypanosomiasis almost all the parasites are inside the brain. It's possible they wouldn't show on smears.
But it's not possible for a Patient who's nEver been to Africa to have African Sleeping Sickness.,I'm just saying it fits the symptoms.
She could have got it from a transfusion.,Or I'm just saying she could have got it from a transfusion.
Which she nEver had.,glares at her Okay!
"Maybe she ignored it, figured she had a cold.","We rejected Lyme Disease because the couple would have noticed a rash, but a wet hacking cough is just going to slip right by?"

By safer you mean the one that's slightly less likely to kill her?,Foreman got the gang testing for Tularemia?
Foreman got the gang testing for Tularemia? Yep.,"PRobably inconclusive, but worth doing. So what's her name? When do I get to meet her?"
There's nobody. Give it up.,"Your lips say no, your shoes say yes."
Well they're French. You can't trust a word they say.,"Solid, yet stylish."
I'm not gonna date a Patient's daughter.,"Very ethical. Of course, most married men would say they don't date at all."
"There was no date! House glares I had lunch with one of the nurses. It's her first time in an oncology unit and she's having a tough time, emotionally.",Perfect.
I wanted to be nice. That's all. I mean it.,You always do. It's part of your charm.

"They came in yesterday, I figured you guys would have been all over them. I know how concerned you are.","to Wilson She's all upset because we paid more attention to the other girl. You check out her ass, I've got the chest."
"The tests were normal. Course that's just my opinion, you may want to call a couple of guys from maintenance in for a consult.",to Wilson You check her EKG results before she left the other day?
You ordered it.,You're the responsible one.
What's wrong? They look normal to me.,to Cuddy Where is she?
"Waiting downstairs, why?",I was right.
Do I have to get rid of the implants?,"Surprisingly, no. But your EKG shows a slightly decreased heart rate."
Is that a pRoblem?,"You told me you hadn't changed your diet or exercise, were you lying?"
"You told me you hadn't changed your diet or exercise, were you lying? Lying?",Does your husband have high blood pressure?
Does your husband have high blood pressure? My husband?,"Yeah.. see, if you're gonna repeat Everything I say this conversation is gonna take twice as long."
"Yes, he was diagnosed six moths ago!",He do a lot of cooking at home?
"Not really, other than oatmeal in the morning.",Did you happen to notice a slightly odd taste to the oatmeal lately?
"Wait, are you saying that--",That it looks like your husband stirred in some of his blood pressure medication along with brown sugar.
You think my husbands trying to poison me?!,"No, nothing like that."
You should have gotten him the sweater. That's ridiculous.,"Fine. But if you're still concerned about the shortness of breath, I'd start making your own breakfast. opens the door to leave"
Wait! What should I do?,"Well, if you care about your husband at all, I'd do the responsible thing buy yourself some condoms, go to a bar, find! seems to realize something Huh. leaves"
"Well, if you care about your husband at all, I'd do the responsible thing buy yourself some condoms, go to a bar, find! seems to realize something Huh. leaves",Lab tests inconclusive?
Lab tests inconclusive? Not surprisingly.,"No. Too bad. Luckily, I have the answer. pause"
pause To what?,Thanks for asking. The life itself. Sex. Anything that can be transmitted via the blood can be transmitted through sex.
Sleeping sickness from sex?,It's not without precedent.
I'm pretty sure it is. Unless you're talking about going to Africa and having sex with the tse tse fly.,A Portuguese Man was diagnosed three years ago with CNS affected sleeping sickness. His only connection with Africa was through a girlfriend who served under the military in Angola.
"Oi, where'd you find that",The Journal de Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical. You don't read Portuguese?
You don't read Portuguese? You do?,I'm pretty sure that's what it said. Either that or it was an ad for sunglasses.
Her husband has nEver been to Africa either.,"Ooh, stymied again. Your logic is bulletproof."
I think ignoring respiratory symptoms is more likely than cheating.,Because?
They're completely devoted to each other.,Because?
They love each other.,Or?
They're overcompensating for guilt.,to Cameron Find out which it is.
You want me to ask a Man whose wife is about to die if he cheated on her?,"No, I want you to be polite and let her die."
You don't trust me to do my job?,We all formulate questions based on the answers we want to hear.
And how exactly do you re-formulate Have you screwed around?,Did you know she's been trying to get pregnant?
Did you know she's been trying to get pregnant? Yes.,After you got so freaked about the sick babies a while ago I figured that was your thing.
You pulled my medical records?,"You coughed the other day, I was concerned."
You were curious. Like an eight-year old boy with a puzzle that's just a little too grown-up for him to figure out. stalks off,"To-MAY-to, to-MAH-to!"
Absolutely not. I love her,Alright then.
I don't know. looks at the monitor! realizes! She's in a coma.,There's only one way a Tularemia Patient goes into a coma while on IV-Chloramphenicol.
The Patient doesn't have Tularemia.,And then there was one. Patient comes in because she's sleeping too much. It takes ten doctors and a coma to diagnose sleeping sickness.
And then there was none. We still have the pRoblem of explaining how a white Parkck from Jersey who's nEver traveled south of D.C. has African sleeping sickness.,"Well, the obvious explanation?"
"I made it clear. If this guy's lying about sleeping around, he knows he's murdering his wife.",Does seem unlikely! Go away. he enters Elise's room
Does seem unlikely! Go away. he enters Elise's room,"lifts Elise's arms, drops them"

Who are you?,I'm Dr. House. Your wife has huMan African Trypanosomiasis. Ed looks puzzled Sleeping sickness.
"You mean its not Tularemia. A virus, tumor or- or cancer.",Nope.
I've nEver had an affair.,I beliEve you.
And I trust Elise.,The treatment for this disease is a drug that's!
Why would she lie if she knew it could kill her?,"I don't ask why Patients lie, I just assume they all do."
"I don't ask why Patients lie, I just assume they all do. But why?","To protect you, because she didn't think it mattered."
I don't know! pause,I'll start the treatment.
So we're treating her for African sleeping sickness because you don't think it's possible for someone to be faithful in a relationship?,And you do?
And you do? Yes.,And you need to tell me that?
"Look I'm not having an affair. I had lunch, with someone I work with, at work. Once.",I beliEve you. What I don't beliEve is that it'll be just once.
I love my wife.,You certainly love saying it.
"You can be a real jerk sometimes, you know that?",Yeah. And you're the good guy.
At least I try.,"As long as you're trying to be good, you can do whatEver you want."

"hesitates When I was in college, I! I fell in love, and I got married. And!",At that age the chances of a marriage lasting--
"It lasted six months. Thyroid cancer metastasized to his brain. There was nothing they could do. I was 21, and! I watched my husband die.",I'm sorry...
You can't be that good a person and well adjusted. Why?,Because you wind up crying over centrifuges.

It is not the hospital's fault if my son kicks off. Kicks off?,I punched up the language mostly for clarification. I understand my doctors consider my decision to be completely idiotic-

Poison was pRobably absorbed through the skin.,They were admitted at 845 and 1100. When were they poisoned?
"In a case that bad, more like 1 1/2 to 4.","So, Matt was poisoned before 715. Before he got on the bus."

"He washed them this morning, right? What?",Nice respectful Asian kid does the laundry.
My wife said he didn't.,"Then I'm guessing he washed them last night, without you knowing."
NEver washed. Now what?,What about Matt's clothes? They new?
"They're ruddy old jeans, I think. They've been bagged up and taken downstairs.",Davis.
Yep they're Matt's. And they're old,"And yet the label isn't faded in the slightest. Fake old. 100 dollars for the homeless look. What, kids aren't pretentious in England?"
"Park's are a different brand, how could they both be contaminated?",That is a question for the ages. In the meantime get these tests in.
I nEver bother to wash new clothes before I wear them.,"Right, your wife does. She wants you to feel nice and comfortable."
"Hey! I'm a Man. I don't have time for laundry, I'm saving lives here. No, she doesn't wash them either.","So your skin absorbs a little dye, the odd chemical here and there!"

What is this?!,"Thought I'd hang out in case you change your mind! and I can give Matt the medicine right away. Don't worry, I've got time."
The CDC promised they'd call.,They will.
What makes you think you're right this time?,"Same reason as last time. You wanna see how the other kid does first, that's ok. Might help you. But there's a real good chance that-"
What? Matt might kick off?,"A little blunt! I was gonna say run out of time, or just sort of let my voice trail off! Mom's cell goes off"

"hands House a cell phone. In a fake Southern accent- The CDC is unable to give an opinion at this time, and! we're gonna have a doctor in your area next week.",You fooled her with that?
"Some guy was selling pants off the back of his truck near the school. When he wasn't busy as a clothing entrepreneur, he did daily at the cornfield over by route one. Used the same truck for both jobs.","Spilled pesticides on the pants, didn't bother to clean up. So, why are you still here? Why aren't you out there making up with the joyful mother?"
Why would I do that?,"No reason at all, you don't care about her or her son."
"Oh, Dr. House. The CDC called. Again.",Oops.
"Call an ambulance! Now! Someone in the recording booth does so, as John stops moving.",I want in.
"John Henry Giles, you a fan of his music?","He's a musician? That paralysis thing, guy can't walk for two years and nobody knows why, that seems mildly interesting."
Forget his paralysis.,Tell that to the rest of his bowling team.
"As far as this hospital is concerned, this is a simple case of lobar pneumonia. Boring.","But that not walking thing, that could turn into something serious!"
Marty Hamilton is his primary physician out in California. He's dealing with the paralysis.,"Know all about it. Multiple treatments, multiple surgeries. Making real progress. Fixed Everything but the legs."
"Dr. Hamilton already called and asked for your team. And by team, I don't mean you.","Like I always say, there's no I in team. There is a me, though, if you jumble it up. They leave her office."
Foreman did his residency with Hamilton.,I know. I did accidentally glance at his resume before I hired him.
He wants someone he can trust.,He must have spoken to Foreman's parole Officer.
Someone who will stick to the pneumonia. John Henry's on an experimental protocol for the paralysis.,I respect that. I'm not going to get in his way.
It's Foreman's case. She walks away.,"It's pneumonia, he can handle it. Guy's already paralyzed, how badly can he screw it up?"
"Dr. House, is there anything back from Micro?",Not yet. You gonna fire me?
You can make up for it by washing my car.,"Oh, this is fun. Chase smiles."
"Let's keep him on the broad-spectrum antibiotics, and since he's displaying septic physiology, draw blood for adrenal and thyroid function. Cameron and Chase stand up, but House's feet resting on the table block their path.",How about the paralysis?
We're sticking to the pneumonia.,"Well, you certainly are, boss. Like a wet tongue sticks to dry ice. Chase and Cameron sit."
The paralysis has already been diagnosed by Dr. Hamilton. It's ALS.,"Lou Gehrig's disease. It's a lovely diagnosis. They make movies about it. No tests, no treatment. It's a disease of exclusion"
-- because Hamilton has excluded Everything else.,I haven't. He gets up and takes the board marker from Foreman. What else could it be?
"Guillain-Barre, which would be rEversible.","Excellent. He starts to write, but Foreman takes the marker away from him."
Antibodies could be attacking the nerve. Multifocal motor neuropathy.,"Uncommon, but it fits. It's also treatable. Did Hamilton try putting the guy on IVIG?"
"No, because the MRI showed","Well, let's do an MRI of our own. Chase and Cameron get up."
Guys? It's my case. They sit down again. ALS fits. It Even predicts the pneumonia. The paralysis is progressive.,It's a death sentence.
He signed a DNR.,takes headphones off He rhymes with dinner?
He signed a DNR.,Oh. That makes more sense. You tell him it might not be ALS?
You tell him it might not be ALS? No.,"Well, no wonder he signed. Who wouldn't?"
I started him on IV steroids and ancinthroid. sp?,"Great. If it was my case, I'd be adding a little IVIG to the mix."
For his pneumonia?,That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
He doesn't want anything done. No treatment.,"DNR means do not resuscitate, not do not treat."
"My nature isn't what it used to be. The little Man has lost some bounce in his step. House looks like he's trying to looks sympathetic. He needs to crank it up, have himself some fun this weekend. confidentially He wants the blue pills.",You're talking about your penis in the third person.
"Me and him, two people.",Separate vacations?
You need to up your insulin to chocolate Parkp ice cream lEvels. Insulin?,"Yeah, you remember."
My pants tell you I have diabetes?,"No, they tell me you're an idiot."
You're giving me the pills?,"Sure, why not?"
"Someone likes music. Oh, yeah.",His stats are in the 70s. How long has he been like this?
How long has he been like this? 10 minutes.,"Well, why aren't you doing"
The IVIG put him into respiratory failure.,You put him on the IVIG?
We did this.,So undo it! Chase!
It's too late! We killed him.,"Nobody killed him! He's not dead! Chase, intubate him!"
What are you doing? You can't do this!,Bag.
You can't do this!,Bag! He grabs the bag himself and starts to ventilate. Cora walks in. He had a bad reaction to some medicine we gave him.
He's stable on the ventilator. Oxygenating well.,"The IVIG made him worse, which means multifocal motoneuropathy was a bad diagnosis. Okay, what's really wrong with him?"
What's wrong with you?,Everyone knows what's wrong with me. What's wrong with him is much more interesting.
You tubed him and he didn't wanna be tubed! He has a legal paper saying just that.,"To intubate or not to intubate, that is the big ethical question. Actually, I was hoping we could avoid it, maybe just practice some medicine."
There's no question. It's the Patient's decision,"-- if the Patient is competent to make it, if his thyroid numbers aren't making him sad."
It's nothing. Do not defend him.,Why did he sign that DNR?
I didn't talk him into,"No, he signed the DNR 'cause he didn't want a slow and painful death from ALS. What was happening to him had nothing to do with his ALS."
"Right! Exactly! It's the IVIG, you screwed up! You're not gonna let him die because you screwed up!","Technically, your case. You screwed up. Is that what this is about? Looking bad in front of your old boss?"
You assaulted that Man.,Fine. I'll nEver do it again.
"Yes, you will.",All the more reason this Debate is pointless. Foreman leaves.
All the more reason this Debate is pointless. Foreman leaves.,"His lungs are worse. Any theories? Cameron looks to see where Foreman went. Oh, I'm sure he just went to the little boys' room. Come on, people."
"Come on, people. Uh, vasculitis?",Wouldn't likely hit both lungs.
Dr. House? House looks surprised.,"Cuddy sent me a stripper again? Ah, love that Woman. So thoughtful."
There are case reports of Wegener's hitting both the legs and the spine.,"Well, it's not great, but it's better than ALS. At least it's treatable."
"looking at the paper It's a restraining order. You're not to come within 50 feet of John Henry Giles, and they've asked the DA to file criminal charges for battery. slight pause","Cameron, test the blood for c-ANCA."
These are criminal charges. They aren't going to let you take blood to make more tests.,"He has blood left in the lab, just add on the c-ANCA. to Chase Foreman's still got you doing bronParkoscopic suctioning for the pneumonia?"
Every four hours.,"Well, while you're down in his lungs, grab a biopsy. We'll need it to confirm Wegener's. And move the Patient to the second floor ICU."
And move the Patient to the second floor ICU. Why?,It's right above the clinic.
It's right above the clinic. I'm pretty sure it's 50 feet in any direction. It's nice having a court order saying you don't have to work clinic duty. He goes and sits in his office.,yelling Dr. Cuddy!
to Patients Excuse me.,You paged me.
Why the yelling?,"His bed is behind that wall. The plaintiff's. I can't, you know, come any closer."
It's right over the clinic. Very cute.,"Can we get the lecture over with, because I've got a, actually, I've got nothing to do. Take your time."
You need a Lawyer?,You don't have a pRoblem with what I did?
"When I hired you, I knew you were insane. I will continue to try and stop you from doing insane things, but once they're done!. Trying to convince an insane person not to do insane things is, in itself, insane, so when I hired you I also set aside $50,000 a year for legal expenses. So far you've come in under budget.",Great. Any chance you could help me run some tests?
Dr. Foreman called Dr. Hamilton. He's flying in from L.A.,You can talk to him.
Dr. Hamilton is flying in as a friend of John Henry's to pull the plug. pause,Yeah. I need a Lawyer.
Dr. House is alleged to have forced a tube down Mr. Giles' throat against his will. House stands up.,"A medical tube, saving his life."
"Dr. House, please let your attorney speak for you. House's attorney makes a noise in the back of his throat.","I'm sorry, your Honor. I was way out of line. He sits."
Why are you doing this? It's not going to keep you out of jail.,No.
"Even if you win, the restraining order and battery charge stay in place. What have you gained?",Time.
To diagnose him? You can't get near him!,I don't want to get near him.
"You know how some doctors have the Messiah complex, they need to save the world? You've got the Rubik's complex, you need to solve the puzzle.","Are you done, or do you have more references to 1980s fads?"
"The DNR order was witnessed by Dr. House's own staff, a, a Dr. Foreman. House stands.","My staff are idiots. I'm sure you know what it's like, your Honor."
And this poor guy has gotta stay on life support until we can schedule a trial. House stands.,Your Honor
"Dr. House, I will hold you in contempt if you don't sit down.",I have a medical issue.
If it pertains to this case your attorney should,It doesn't. Do you have any history of heart disease in your family? Giles' attorney scoffs.
Giles' attorney scoffs. Your Honor!,"Your fingers. They show signs of clubbing, which indiCate a health pRoblem. Remember Bart Giamotti? Same thing, just dropped dead one day. Please see your doctor."
He's admitted this isn't relevant. Can we please get back to the motion?,"Of course, I'm sorry. He sits."
"Congratulations, impressive legal argument.",I watched Matlock last night. He pulls off his tie.
"Oh, say no more. I didn't notice any clubbing on the Judge's fingers.",Neither did I.
"So, the family history thing!",Every family has some history of heart disease.
Biopsy only shows inflammation.,Start him on Cytoxan.
You're diagnosing Wegener's based on a little inflammation?,"Well, unfortunately I think we've exhausted all the tests we can do in the capacity as the doctors he doesn't want doing tests on him."
But you don't --,We'll know I'm right if he starts walking.
"You can't do any more tests, but you want me to treat him?","The medicine's in the pharmacy, Patient's immobilized in the ICU. Sounds like a simple geography pRoblem."
Can I help you?,"Uh, I'm Dr. House, I'm"
"I'd appreciate any list of medications, anything like that.",I've started him on Cytoxan.
"For Wegener's, right? Look, Gregg. I checked you out, you know? I know you're a good doctor. You have to appreciate that I'm a good doctor, too.",Why?
"Wegener's is one of the first things I looked for. The biopsy and the blood tests were negative, just like yours.","There's an error rate, Marty."
"It's not your fault, Eric.","No, it's mine. Eric."
How's the old place doing? They start to chat.,"Oh, this is wonderful. They stop chatting. But before you guys break out the oil, I should point out you can't pull the plug I have a court order."
"You used to, but",I have the right to face my accuser. Judge said so.
Not if no one's accusing you. All the charges have been dropped.,He doesn't have to die.
It's not Wegener's.,"If it's Wegener's, his lungs won't be able to handle it. As soon as they pull that plug he'll die."
He's still breathing.,It's not Wegener's. Wrong again. He walks off.
"He's stable, but one of his arms is now paralyzed.","The real question is, why is he still alive?"
He's alive because you were wrong. It's not Wegener's.,"Yeah, seem to be doing that a lot, lately. People keep living because of my mistakes."
Progression of the paralysis pretty much confirms Hamilton was right. It's ALS.,Assuming this is a progression of his paralysis.
He can't move his arm.,"Yes, his arm is paralyzed."
How about this one? He's not our Patient.,"Nope, not good enough."
"He could have suffered a stroke when he was intubated. Foreman looks at her. Well, blood clots are common in intubated Patients. The inactivity causes",Not interested in why. Let's get an MR-angiogram for an embolic stroke.
He doesn't want you treating him!,They dropped the court order.
"Yeah, and that girl dropped the charges against Kobe. Doesn't mean that he should call her and see if she's free to get a sundae.","Good point, but I can go within 50 feet of him now."
"Okay. Hamilton leaves. John starts coughing. House, who was hiding behind a column in the lobby, comes into the room. Get outta here.","Sure. That makes sense. You hate me for saving your life. In fairness to your side, you were also dying because of me, so"
You know I didn't wanna be saved.,"That's what's interesting. Your thyroid was low, but not low enough to cause depression."
"So, you came here to tell me that Even if I can't walk I can still hear the birds sing? Enjoy the rainbow, and feeling the sun shine on my face?",Those things are fun.
"Yeah, sure. I'll stick around to indulge your obsession. It's over. I lost my air. The session the other night, with those kids? That was a test to see if I could still play. I can't.",And that's all you are? A musician?
"I got one thing, same as you.","Really? Apparently, you know me better than I know you."
"I know that limp. I know the empty ring finger. And that obsessive nature of yours, that's a big secret. You don't risk jail and your career just to save somebody who doesn't want to be saved unless you got something, anything, one thing. The reason normal people got wives and kids and hobbies, whatEver. That's because they don't got that one thing that hits them that hard and that true. I got music, you got this. The thing you think about all the time, the thing that keeps you south of normal. Yeah, makes us great, makes us the best. All we miss out on is Everything else. No Woman waiting at home after work with the drink and the kiss, that ain't gonna happen for us.",That's why God made microwaves.
"Yeah, but when it's over, it's over.","Yeah. He walks to the door and opens it. Suddenly, he walks back and starts to undo the cords connecting John to the monitors."
What are you doing?,It's not over for me.
"Listen, listen, I just think it wouldn't hurt him to learn a little humility. We see that House has been standing behind Foreman. Whoops!","So, what's the verdict?"
There's a good chance we can still bust the clot with tPA.,Do it. See what happens to his arm.
"I don't know, I guess! It's just with Dr. Hamilton here, I notice a difference in styles.",His style involves humility. small pause Another difference in our styles I don't care much for apologies. You can go.
"I didn't know you were standing there when I said that, okay? It was completely rude.","Do you mean genuine humility? You know, with all the self-doubt and the self-questioning, or Hamilton's polite, patronizing Aw, shucks humility?"
You're both excellent doctors.,Thank you. And humility is an important quality. Especially if you're wrong a lot.
You've been wrong Every step of the way.,"Of course, when you're right, self-doubt doesn't help anybody, does it? His beeper goes off. We gotta go."
"We gotta go. Congratulations, Gregg.","mutters to Foreman Congratulations! aloud Why, Marty?"
"Now look, I know we've had our differences, but I think when a person does something well House picks up the phone it ought to be recognized.","The phone works. Next time you want to make me feel all warm and fuzzy, leave a message. He taps John's leg. Don't get me wrong, I'm overcome with joy."
Doc? Yeah?,What?
You just touched my leg.,"What, you gonna charge me with assault again?"
"No, I felt it.",He now has feeling all the way up to calf.
You're saying he just spontaneously got better?,"No, I'm saying let's rule out the lunar god and go from there."
I'm sure he will.,It's one of ours.
How do we figure out which drug is doing the trick?,Easy. We stop all of them.
One of those drugs is helping him.,"And the rest? Steroids, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, they're toxic if we leave him on all of them."
He'll walk again.,"Yeah, to his own funeral."
"But if we stop Everything, he'll get worse.","True. And then we'll add our medications back, one at a time. If he gets better, then we'll have our answer."
And if he doesn't get better?,Then we're in trouble. Not as much as he is. I suppose that was your point.
"I assume you want me to convince Hamilton to stop his treatments, too?",Don't care.
You know at least five of the medications are part of his protocol?,If his stuff was helping the guy would be playing tennis six months ago. It's our round of treatment that's helping.
"So your philosophy is, If they don't want treatment, they get it shoved down their throat, but if it might cure their paralysis, whoa, better slow down.",Yeah.
What's your philosophy on employee relations?,That's a very tiny pillow.
Gregg. Can I have a word?,"Can it wait for the commercial, Marty? Say hi to my friend, Jimmy."
Pleasure. Your diagnostic trial,"Seriously, commercial's in about five minutes."
-- it's a dangerous game.,Only if we're watParkng in the bathtub.
I need to know exactly what medications you were giving John Henry.,Forget it. And if Foreman tells you what John Henry used to be on
You're gonna fire him?,Nope. Make him live out Every day of his two-year contract.
Foreman asked to leave?,Not yet.
But how do you know I made him an,"You're a polite twit, but you're not an idiot."
I need to know what medications you've taken him off of.,"Wait a second. You're not an idiot. You need to know what medications I've stopped, because!"
"Wait a second. You're not an idiot. You need to know what medications I've stopped, because!",He's getting worse. He whacks John's leg with a clipboard. Nothing. to Foreman Right now you still work for me. Come on!
He's getting worse. He whacks John's leg with a clipboard. Nothing. to Foreman Right now you still work for me. Come on!,"No feeling, no wiggling. The bad news is, John Henry's back where he started. The good news is, Hamilton looks bad."
"Yeah, it's not whether you win or lose, it's whether the other guy loses.",What was the first thing we put him on?
"Steroids, for the pneumonia.","Well, put him back on them. Give them 24 hours, see what happens."
His lungs aren't great. It might cause another respiratory collapse.,Sure hope not. I didn't much like that Lawyer. And get an MRI.
He already got one. And an MRA.,"Well, obviously something is different now. Do it again. Chase, take care of the scan. Cameron, put him on the steroids. to Foreman We should pRobably talk, huh?"
"He has to. If he doesn't, he's telling Foreman he needs him. House can't handle that. She looks closely at the screen. Oh, my God!",I checked him out. He's a great doctor. You think he's better than I am?
This about your ego?,Answer the question.
It's that simple? I should just ignore the mockery and abuse?,"Oh, how do I abuse you?"
How do you not? If I make a mistake,"I hold you accountable, so what?"
Dr. Hamilton forgives. He's capable of moving on.,That is not what he does!
"I screwed up his case, he told me","He nEver said you were forgiven. I was there, he said it wasn't your fault."
"I was there, he said it wasn't your fault. So?","So, it was."
"Intradural, compressing his spine. Chase puts up the scans.",Causing his paralysis.
How could Hamilton have missed an AVM?,"Well, we missed it, too. 'Cause it wasn't there before."
You saying it just grew overnight?,"No. It was on the spine, it wasn't on the MRI. He points to the scan from a few days ago. Same anatomic location."
It's not there.,"Well, what is there?"
"Well, what is there? Nothing.",Or something that looks like nothing.
"If it's inflammation, the steroids would have shrunk it down.","REvealing the AVM, which has always been there, hiding behind its own swelling. We remove that, he'll walk again."
Dr. House! Cora's meeting me outside with a limo. I'm being discharged.,Fifty bucks says I can beat you to the curb. John laughs.
Thanks for sticking with the case.,I can't do anything else. He takes the Vicodin. You're much more easily amused when you can walk.
How bizarre. I'm guessing you weren't exactly Mr. Sunshine Even before your leg got messed up. John hands House his trumpet as It's a Wonderful World starts to play. Aw. I want you to have this.,Wow.
"You can sell it if you want to, just promise me you won't play it. House smiles. How Many of those pills you taking?",I'm in pain.
"Yeah. Aren't we all? pause So, where do you buy these things, do they have cane stores?","Oh, don't worry about it. You'll be jogging before you need a second one. Foreman comes out a side door. See you tomorrow, Eric."
sighs and nods He's wrong,"Foreman is wrong? The neurologist is wrong, about a neurological pRoblem?"
He took one look at her and figured it was a scam.,"So, you figure he's not being objective"
"exasperated House, the Woman had a twitch. She had a seizure.",Both of which Foreman saw?
He just wanted her out the door!,"Whoah, whoah, whoah, back up there, big fella. Foreman's the guy you want to take a swing at."
frustrated sigh I - just - want her to get some medical attention.,starts to look interested That's not Even close to being true. Something else. Something personal. pauses Give me the file. Looks like this will be fun.
Brain tumor? Foreman enters,"Glad you could join us, Eric. What's the differential for a twitch in the wrist?"
"Yes, you've got that going for you. How could I have doubted your medical opinion?","The big question, you're missing it, all of you. He drops Jane's smelly bag on the table."
"He drops Jane's smelly bag on the table. Oh, geez.",Who is she?
opens mouth in protest,Do I need a better reason?
"Most people wouldn't, you do.","dumps contents of smelly bag on table, Everyone turns away in disgust The only thing we know for sure about Jane Doe is that her name isn't Jane Doe."
holds up a needle Wow. Looks just like insulin. looks at Wilson,holds up a sweater Vomit. Still moist. sniffs What do you think - a couple of days old? puts it in Chase's face
Uhhh! trying to make me hurl?,Yeah. And here's the big finish! licks fingers
"muffled noise, as if about to be sick",Salty. Chemical imbalance.
Low magnesium could cause a twitch.,"Or high calcium. Or it's a coincidence. The point is, we don't know anything."
exasperated So do the MRI. Find out,"The MRI can wait. Hang a banana bag, give her 24 hours to correct the electrolyte imbalance, we'll take it from there."
"Okay. Even if she's not faking, what's so fascinating about this case?","At the moment, how much you don't want me to take it. That's pretty fascinating."
grabs letter opener from House I can't beliEve you authorized this.,Really? Sounds exactly like something I'd do.
"She can't have an MRI. The CT scan shows she has a surgical pin in her arm, the MRI magnet would have ripped it out of her body. You like the Alien movies? You had no medical history, what were you thinking?","We'll surgically remove the pin, then do the MRI, does that sound good?"
She has an electrolyte imbalance.,"Dr. Foreman, a neurologist, beliEves this Woman has a brain tumor."
"Foreman, a neurologist, beliEves this Woman has a brain tumor. Actually, I","glares at Foreman Hey, don't Ever apologize for a medical opinion."
How are we supposed to,"Hey! He knows more homeless people than any of us. Cuddy and Foreman don't look amused Go check out the 'hood, dawg."
"Sure, she's not conning us, the MRI is.",enters Not wearing a coat in this weather. That is so wrong.

"Water well, water's October, right? Obviously.","On the page number 22, so that's October 2nd, 2002. Ergo, the Patient was in a car accident two years ago last October."
quite calmly My goodness! Was she okay?,"squints Broke her arm, I think. They fixed it with this. holds up metal pin"
"squints Broke her arm, I think. They fixed it with this. holds up metal pin","Surgical pin. Better than a wallet. Serial numbers in case of recall, tied to a Patient's name."
That's why you insisted on the MRI. So you could remove the surgical pin from her arm.,"You didn't think I was going to do it to save your sorry ass, did you?"
"Well, we got her sedated and stabilized.",And we still think there's nothing wrong with her?
"Well, nothing's changed.",We almost killed her that's different. And we know who she is.
"Well, I'd be bummed out too. Zero degrees, living in a box.",Put her back on it. She cheers up she might stop biting people
"And the cancer wouldn't account for the alleged twitch, or any other of her alleged symptoms.","Actually, it would. Neoplastic Syndrome associated with the cancer could cause her to twitch like a bunny on crystal meth. Ultrasound her ovaries."
Did you find a brain tumor on her MRI?,No. Foreman was wrong. I'm starting to wonder about that guy's medical chops.
"The little ones are licking each other again, and Harry's got a seeping wart on his extra toe. What room should we go to?","fake sneeze You know, I think I might be coming down with something. Hate to give it to you guys. Sorry. starts walking toward exit"

keeps walking Working hard?,This stuff's pretty good.
You trying to teach me something here?,"We've got the flowing dress, the ring. Think the Patient was married? Maybe it was a bad break up, maybe he dumped her cause she was on drugs."
You care about her personal history?,"Nope. Question is, why don't you? Foreman looks away I hate to cite a clich, but Dad on the streets?"
short laugh Dad's with Mom.,They're both living on the streets?
No! On a pension.,So who pissed you off?
"Pfft. Right now, you.","Your turn, you gonna tell me why this case?"
"She's my new girlfriend, I'm having a tattoo designed, I was hoping you could find out her name.",So she's just another sick person the kindly Dr. Wilson has made sure doesn't get lost in the big ugly system.
"Yes, I forgot, I need a reason to give a crap.",You're giving two craps.

"Did your pager really just go off, or are you ditParkng the conversation?",Why can't both be true? Come on.
You were right. There's nothing we can do for her here. Might as well put her back on the street.,Unless it's not cancer.
"Oh, you're joking.","Well, hard not to nothing funnier than cancer."

"Also, I have an idea for his eye.",Nothing we can do about his eye.
He's got a clot in his retinal,Read the memo.
"If we remove some of the liquid from the eye itself, the Vitreous humor, it might make some extra room around the retinal artery.","If the artery expands, the clot might move out on its own. That's very creative. Why didn't you mention this before?"

"Hemolytic anemia doesn't cause liver damage. Add the fact he's coughing blood, you've got three of the indicators of organ-threatening lupus.",It's moving too fast. Could be hepatitis-E.
There's only been one case of hep-E originating in the US since --,Its history. Since he's been in and out of the country four times in the last year!
You really think he's got hep-E?,No. I think the lupus is way more likely.
All right. Then let's start him on IV Cytoxan and plasmapheresis.,"No, we should rule out hep-E."
You just said it wasn't hep-E.,"I said lupus was way more likely, but if we treat for lupus and it is hep-E."
"I said lupus was way more likely, but if we treat for lupus and it is hep-E. He's toast.",Exactly.
But there isn't a treatment for hepatitis-E. Either he'll get better on his own or he'll continue to deteriorate.,"Yeah, I went to medical school, too. Start him on solumedrol. sp?"
If he's got hep-E that's only going to make him worse!,Not as much.
We'll know it's not hep-E and start treating him for lupus.,Now watch me do it while drinking a glass of water.
"What do we tell the dad? We think your kid has lupus, so we're gonna treat him for hepatitis-E? And oh yeah, if it really is hep-E, we're not actually giving him hep-E medication, so it's gonna make him worse, not better?",You think he'll go for that?
So you want us to lie?,No. I want you to lie.
I want you to lie. Why me?,Because he trusts you.
looking at x-rays of House's hand I think it's broken. What did you do?,Accidentally closed the car door on it.
No. Door would have broken the skin. This looks like something hard and smooth smashed it.,I want my Lawyer.
The brain has a gating mechanism for pain. Registers the most sEvere injury and blocks out the others. Did it work?,"Well, my hand hurts like hell. Yeah, I feel much better."
"Yeah, I feel much better. Huh.",Don't splint it. I want to be able to bang it against the wall if I need to administer another dose. Just! tape it up. Cuddy walks in.
Why did you tell Cameron to lie to Mr. Foster?,to Wilson Make it tight will ya.
to Wilson Make it tight will ya. Answer me.,"Nothing I could say is going to change how you feel, and nothing could come out of your reaction that is going to change what I plan to do, so"
"So, that was you just saying nothing.",Uh-huh.
The guy is furious.,And scared.
"So, what are you going to do? The father's insisting on the lupus treatment.","Yeah, Cameron told me and I told her to tell him no."
"Well, you can't just sit back and let the kid die.",Neither can the father.
So that's your plan? You're gonna play Parkcken with the kid's life?,"Well, he's the dad. I should win easily."
Take the week off.,"What, 'cause I lied to a Patient?"
I told him that you wouldn't treat him for the lupus until,What did he say?
That's what I told him.,And that's when he caved.
Yeah. He agreed to do it your way.,Two plus two equals four.
"Hallucinations are a symptom of psychosis, which is the fourth diagnostic criterion. It's official. This is lupus.",Who's Jules? Any mention of her in the medical history?
"It doesn't matter what he's hallucinating about, it matters why! It's lupus!","There's no need to get snippy. This kind of lupus takes years to get to this point, it's been a week."
"Yeah, and a 16-year-old kid shouldn't have hemolytic anemia, or be bleeding out of Every orifice, but he is. We had an opportunity to treat this, instead we diddled around with hepatitis-E and now it's too late. He needs a new liver. We screwed up.",You're saying I screwed up.
You're saying I screwed up. Yes.,Then why didn't you just say that?
You gonna just blame this on her?,Did you agree with my recommendation to treat for hep-E?
And she made herself quite clear.,And then she went and lied to the father. That's why you're angry.
"Yeah, I trusted you.",You always trust me. Big mistake. Lupus is a bad diagnosis.
It's the best diagnosis we've got.,That doesn't make it good.
"No, it just makes it this kid's only chance to live. small pause",Put him on the transplant list.
And what happened to your hand?,Got stuck in a drawer.
"Yeah, right. You're going through withdrawal.","No, I am going through pain. Pain causes nausea."
"I took this job to work with you, not cover your ass. He reaches into his pocket and takes out House's Vicodin, which he puts on the desk. Your Vicodin.",And your solution is to give me drugs. It's interesting.
"And hope for someone to die. House walks up, although walk is too jaunty a term. It is evident he didn't take the pills Foreman gave him.",Who's Jules?
"Dr. House, you should get back to your office",Jules. There's no Jules in the history.
It was a hallucination.,Of what?
How long can he wait? Not long.,I don't think this is lupus.
"I don't think this is lupus. Come on, let's just go",Your fourth diagnostic criterion of lupus is psychosis this is just a kid missing his cat.
He was being attacked by an animal that wasn't in the room. That's psychosis.,There's a difference between psychosis and hallucination.
"So, if he was imagining a fake cat it'd be lupus, but since it was a real cat it's not? Take your damn pills.",Psychosis requires
There's no cat! Jules is dead.,"You have a dead family pet, and you nEver mentioned it? Nice family history."
"Family history is asking about family members, meaning people related to the Patient. Let's go.",How did the cat die?
"Dr. House, come on, let's go",What happened to the cat?
from the waiting area Old age. She was fifteen years old.,When?
Does this have anything to do with,Where'd she sleep?
This is not a cat allergy.,It's not lupus. Where is Jules?
"Scalpel. He's about to cut, when House enters.",Stop the gases.
"What the hell are you doing, House?",Saving a sixteen-year-old kid from a lifetime of immunosuppressant drugs and a very nasty scar. This kid doesn't have lupoid hepatitis. He has acute naphthalene toxicity.
Naphthalene. You're talking about mothballs.,Nope.
And your assumption is based on what?,The autopsy I just conducted on his pet cat.
Call Cuddy. And security.,You are not removing that kid's liver.
"NOW! Nurse goes to call. House coughs up some phlegm, and spits it on the surgeon. Have you completely lost your mind?!","No, but I have been feeling a little sick lately. Achoo!"
"You've already cost him his liver, don't kill him too!",Why are you so eager to cut into a healthy kid?
Healthy? He's in the toilet!,He just needs some Parkcken soup.
I'm telling Hourani to re-scrub. We're doing this transplant.,"No, you're not."
They've only gotten worse.,If the food here wasn't one step below Riker's Island he would've gotten better. He's lost fourteen pounds.
"Yeah, sure. This is nothing but a dietary thing.","Naphthalene is a gas, a fat soluble gas."
"So, getting away from the poison is what poisoned him?","Getting him away from his dad's meatloaf is what's killing him. Cuddy and Keith's dad walk up to House, very quickly."
"Hey! Take it easy. House touches his lip, which is bleeding.","Your cat did not die of old age. He died of massive internal bleeding and acute liver failure caused by naphthalene poisoning, the exact same thing your son has."
"You lie to me, you mess up my son's surgery, and now you expect me to trust you?","Give me twenty-four hours, we'll pump your son full of calories"
We're doing that surgery.,"getting up slowly If you do the surgery, you'll be killing a mother of four."
Father of three.,I was guessing.
Like you are now?,Naphthalene poisoning is the best explanation we have for what's wrong with your son.
You made it a week.,And won my prize.
And won my prize. Congratulations.,Cuddy's a sucker. I would have done it for two weeks off.
"Yeah, it was a piece of cake. You learn anything? They've reached his office door.","Yeah, I'm an addict. He goes into his office. Wilson follows."
"Wilson follows. Uh, okay.",I'm not stopping.
There are programs. Cuddy would give you the time. You could get on a different pain Management regimen,I don't need to stop.
You just said!,"I said I was an addict. I didn't say I had a pRoblem. I pay my bills, I make my meals. I function."
Is that all you want? You have no relationships.,I don't want any relationships.
You alienate people.,I've been alienating people since I was three.
"Oh, come on! Drop it! You don't think you've changed in the last few years?","Well, of, of course I have. I've, I've gotten older. My hair's gotten thinner. Sometimes I'm bored, sometimes I'm lonely, sometimes I wonder what it all means."
"No, I was there! You are not just a regular guy who's getting older, you've changed! You're miserable, and you're afraid to face yourself",slams his cane down on the shelf Of course I've changed! pause
And Everything's the leg? Nothing's the pills? They haven't done a thing to you?,"They let me do my job, and they take away my pain. Wilson walks off, looking defeated."
He's got osteopenia. His bones are too thin to fix the arm.,"On cell phone No, price is not a pRoblem if you have what I need. Click"
Click Osteo-,Young Man?
How did you know?,"Well, if he's an old Man, osteopenia would just be a fact of life, you make him comfortable, send him home, which means you're just boring me."
MRI and PET scan are both negative.,"Well, how old is he? Maybe the osteopenia is just early onset."
"Pulls out a baseball card Well, let's see. Born 9/21/77.","It's Hank Wiggen? Takes the card and looks at it He signed it, sweet. Reads To Jimmy Wilson, the Cy Young of medicine. You ask for that?"
"I-just the Jimmy part. The bone's too thin to support the kind of surgery that would let him pitch again. But if we figure out what's causing the osteopenia, we can rEverse the bone damage, then do the surgery.","Beat the Yankees, and save the free world. Hands the card to Wilson and goes into his office."
Sorry I'm late. Car broke down on the interstate.,"Checks his watch, then looks back at Foreman skeptically."
"Cancer. It first attacks the bones, and then the kidneys.","Come on, people. Pulls out the baseball card He was 17 and 7! His ERA was 2.1."
"You want it to be his kidneys, because if it's his kidneys, then maybe we can treat it, maybe we can fix it. And if it's cancer, then he'll nEver pitch again. If this were a regular guy who came in and broke his arm lifting a box, you would've packed him up and sent him home!","My God, you're right, I lost my head."
Chase smirks He weighed 175 his rookie year. Stop.,Now he's 195 after playing a year in Japan. Why?
That'd explain the weight gain. And the kidney pRoblems.,And the bone loss.
I was coming in early.,Huh.
"Claims he has 500 Lawyer jokes, only tells one? Uh!new guy.","You need cash?!Ah, no, I, I don't have that much on me!No no, it's not a pRoblem."
House checks out. It's 445.,I was rounding up.
"Carol Moffett, please see Dr. House in Exam Room 1. Woman gets to her feet with difficulty.","Whoa, whoa, not so fast, Kathy."
It's Carol. House comes over,"Ah. checks watch Uh, trouble with the leg? Carol nods, House spots a bridal magazine in her purse When's the wedding?"
"Carol nods, House spots a bridal magazine in her purse When's the wedding? This Saturday.","Not much time to fit into that pretty dress, and no time for practical shoe-shopping. You're running two miles a day further than you should be."
rubs her calf It hurts right here-,"New shoes, less miles, and ex-nay on the afternoon Cokes, you're gonna look beautiful. Looks at the next guy What's wrong with you?"
I can't get my contact lenses out-,leans close Out of what? They're not in your eyes.
But they're red.,That's because you're trying to remove your corneas. walks over to next Man What's wrong with you?
"Uh, lately, my wife has noticed that-","Yeah, yeah. Symptoms, gestures at Cuddy we're working on a personal best here."
"Numbness in my feet and hands, constipation- Cuddy comes over to House",And?
Maybe he doesn't feel comfortable talking about his private matters-,"Well, neither would I, if I was having trouble controlling my pee pee!"
"I can't see!Nah, I'm just screwing with you. House looks pointedly at Cuddy, who smiles It's a hangover, my English Lit prof. told me he'd fail me next time if I didn't show up with a doctor's note.","Well, make friends with the dentist."
"Elevated beta 2 proteins, though, could be cancerous. Amyloidosis, or lymphoma.",Or steroids. You guys got any money on you?
"He tested negative for steroids. I, um, I have a couple 20s on me. reaches into her pocket",50 of them? Cameron looks shocked Foreman?
"The fat pad biopsy and abdominal CT scan were negative for the cancers, but-","Well, that just leaves us with steroids!"
He tested negative for steroids.,Less money is made by biochemists working on a cure for cancer than by their colleagues struggling valiantly to find ways to hide steroid use.
Less money is made by biochemists working on a cure for cancer than by their colleagues struggling valiantly to find ways to hide steroid use. But there's one thing they can't hide!checks his watch and walks past Ducklings 1 and 2.,Hi.
"pulls the covers back on I am clean, Man, no steroids, no nothing.","Your lips say no, your prunes say yes."
"Your lips say no, your prunes say yes. Hypogonadism. Isn't that a great word? Thanks, we don't get to say it nearly enough. To Cameron Start him on Lupron right away. Walks out the door.","These freaks are willing to defile themselves for mass entertainment, for money. I feel sorry for them. Pops a Vicodin. Lola runs after him"
"He drops a clean urine, denies using steroids, then you're giving him a drug for what, steroid abuse?","!No, no, it's not."
You put him on Lupron.,Uh-huh.
"And, you told them it was like milk.",Yes.
Is there any way in which that is not a lie?,"thinks for a moment It's creAmy. But, I had 3 reasons."
"But, I had 3 reasons. Good ones?","Well, we'll see in a minute, I'm just making them up now!He lied to me first."
Your mother did teach you 2 wrongs don't make a right.,"If he lies to me about not taking steroids, then I lie to him about not treating steroids, he's cured. Adds up for me-"
Adds up for me- Second reason.,"If I told him the truth, he wouldn't have taken the stuff."
"And if he told you the truth, what would this stuff do to him?",!SEvere respiratory pRoblems.
!SEvere respiratory pRoblems. Third reason.,I wanted to eliminate the placebo effect.
Excellent! walks over to her desk You and your Lawyer can write a paper.,Which brings me to my fourth reason.
I thought you said there were only three. sits down,I thought you'd buy one of them.
I thought you'd buy one of them. Seriously?,He's not gonna sue.
"Because his Lawyer is a nice guy, who realizes it's unfair to blame us for ruining this kid's hundred million-dollar career.","Good guess, but no."
"Good guess, but no. If the Lupron causes respiratory pRoblems, it means he's not on steroids, which means there's something else wrong with him. And the choices, for that something else, are almost universally very bad. Ooh, serious.",Osteopenia messing his bones up.
Shrunken testicles indiCate his body's not putting out enough testosterone.,"glances at Foreman and checks his watch Throw out the lungs, that was the Lupron, my fault. Don't worry, I'll send him a nice note."
"What about something environmental? Arsenic, mercury, the symptoms could indiCate-","Pretty small environment. Wife's fine, no one else is sick."
"If you throw out the kidneys, Everything else adds up. The testicles, the bones, the impaired liver function, could all be caused by a breakdown of his adrenal glands.","Addison's disease, I like it. Mainly of course, because the treatment is!"
rolls her eyes Steroids.,Enough irony for all of us.
"Treatment would cause him to retain fluid. With the kidneys almost shut down already, he'll die.","Well, we'll get him a new kidney. Cameron looks surprised"
Your theory is that Addison's is causing all the symptoms except for the kidney pRoblems. What's causing the kidney pRoblems?,"Cameron, if you could make an ironic guess right about now?"
Negative for steroids. grins,"Agreed. He's not on steroids now. If he was on them anytime in the last five years, it could've caused the kidney damage."
"Agreed. He's not on steroids now. If he was on them anytime in the last five years, it could've caused the kidney damage.","You see, kidneys don't wear watches. Sure, gallbladders do, but it doesn't matter, 'cuz kidneys can't tell time. Steroid damage could take years."
shakes her head No steroids. How Many times does he have to tell you?,I don't know. How Many times did he lie about cocaine before coming clean with the league?
That is completely different.,"Oh, that's right, I remember. You nEver did come clean. The league was out to get you, they faked the blood tests, you had to get yourself a Lawyer-"
"If Hank says he nEver used steroids, that's the truth.",That's too bad.
Get another explanation.,Okay. Yeah. Think I've got one in my other pants. starts to leave
"Hold on. House turns around Five years ago, Bangor, Maine. My pitParkng coach had me on something, I nEver knew what it was.",And you nEver tried too hard to find out either.
How you doin' Doc?,"Good. Very good, yeah."
You want me to put Hank Wiggen on the transplant list.,He needs a new kidney. I was thinking the kidney people might have some.
"Well, they like to save them for people who have-how do I put this- kidney pRoblems.","He's a professional ballplayer, brings joy to millions."
"That's a great idea, we can be the hospital that killed two people. The guy who deserved the kidney, and the ballplayer we bumped up the list when we weren't Even sure what was wrong with him.",Everything else is related to the Addison's.
The test for Addison's was inconclusive.,The test for Addison's is always inconclusive.
Why do we do it at all? We should just ask you. tries to take a paper from under House's fist he doesn't budge. She gives him an irritated look.,"You're not putting him on the list. Moves his hand, Cuddy takes paper"
Your powers of deduction are breathtaking.,You take a perverse pleasure at turning me down.
"It's what I live for. Once in a while, though, try to ruin my day. Ask me something I can say yes to. House leaves","Oh, I'm sorry Doctor, I didn't know you were busy. Want me to come back?"
Is he on the list?,No. walks over to her
Then I'm giving him one of mine.,!Okay.
You're not gonna tell me it's a bad idea? Why give a kidney to someone who might not be able to use it?,"Not my area. That is, howEver, my chair."
gets up When do we do it? House sits down,"Very noble gesture. My favorite kind-dramatic, yet completely empty. The chances of non-identical twins being a match-"
Do you live alone?,You writing a book?
I made it a question just because it's more polite. You got a big Keep Out sign stapled on your forehead.,"That explains it, I told them to put it on my door."
"Even if real huMan contact is something you don't have or Even want, or need, you should at least be able to see it in other people.",Yeah. Right. True love. That's just how we match organs these days. There's a couple in France-high school sweethearts-they're trading brains.
Or needs a thousand bucks. Foreman laughs What is with that?,I scored.
finally shuts his mouth How much?,"True cost, no Man can say."
Could that Man's accountant say?,One thousand dollars. Friday night-the biggest official monster truck jam in the history of New Jersey!
"looks horrified Okay, please tell me you didn't just say Friday night.","WhatEver you've got, you cancel."
I-I can't do it!,"Listen, they only give these tickets to owners."
"I've got the oncology thing! I-I!The rectal cancer lecture, they booked me a year ago! I-I-I-I-I can't get out, there's no way out!","looks disappointed, then turns away Fine."
"Uh, and who!?","thinks a moment Kevin, in Bookkeeping."
"Okay, well first of all, his name's Carl.",I call him Kevin. It's a secret friendship club name.
"If you have the results, I'd like you to talk to both of us. If you don't, wait for me to-","BeliEve me, I'd much rather be with your better half."
"looks shocked I, I do? House nods, and Lola looks happy and reliEved.",You're also pregnant.
Foreman says we've got a pRoblem with the transplant.,"walks over to the bookshelf and shuffles through it If she terminates the pregnancy, he's not going to let himself die on principle."
!Would you give up a baby for someone you love?,turns around and gives her a piercing look Please tell me I don't have to decide.
Is this a pragmatic question for you?,"Fifty years, no pRoblem."
quietly I couldn't do it.,You found religion.
Do you have to be religious to beliEve a fetus is a life?,There seems to be a correlation.
!I don't know what they are. SERIOUSLY?!,"!Right. he looks down for a moment I got two tickets. Cameron looks at him, puzzled Friday night."
You asking me to go with you?,Sure. Sounds good.
Sounds good. Like a!date?,"Exactly. Except for the date part. She stares at him, shocked speechless. He turns away quickly, embarrassed. Forget it. starts to walk to the computer desk"
"No, I-I was gonna go to the oncology dinner!","'Course, you have to hear Wilson's lecture. sits down"
"His heart rate is 130 and rising, like a Randy Johnson line drive.",thinks a moment A for effort.
Heart rate's down to 40.,I thought it was up.
What's wrong? they enter Hank's room,I have no idea. To Chase Hit him with the atropine sp? before he gets to 35 again.
We've already given him 3 ml. Chase uncaps another IV,"Apparently, that's not enough."
We can't stabilize his heart rate.,What did you do to him?
It wouldn't do this.,"But something did. He sighs, and heads for the door Call me when he's stable!or dead. leaves"
"I'll just try one, Warner. As House is watParkng, Wilson comes in. House glances at him, then continues watParkng Hank.","Three more symptoms. Heart rate up, heart rate down, now he's hallucinating."
He's not just dreaming?,No REM. He's actually awake.
He's actually awake. Drugs?,"Not psychedelics, not with the heart symptoms."
"All hallucinations would point to digitalis. It would also mess up his heart. But, he's not on it, and why would he take it?",!Yeah. Pithy analysis. gets up I can see why they asked you to speak at the cancer dinner. I'm sorry I'm gonna miss it.
I'm sorry about the monster trucks.,"No, I think it's great. You're!giving back. starts out the door"
"Sure, it's got a lotta movement, pRoblem is Everybody sees the movement. Yer throwing yer curve ball, like yer throwing a curve ball. he turns to the player Deception, that's it. he suddenly spots House, who is sitting a few rows over. Same motion, less movement, so it won't come back at ya. moves away and sits down next to House How'd you get in here?",Spoke Spanish. Told them I was the new shortstop from the Dominican.
How's Hank doin'?,Lousy.
"Yeah, I got a heart condition. What's wrong with Hank?",What do you take for it?
What do you take for it? Digitalis. GASP!,"Got 'em with you? Warner reaches into his coat pocket, pulling out a half-empty/half-full bottle."
That's weird. I just filled this prescription a couple days ago. There's another bottle here. searches through his pockets.,Don't bother. Warner stops and looks at him. Hank Wiggen stole your pills. He tried to kill himself. Warner stares at House. House stares right back. STARING CONTEST!
Don't bother. Warner stops and looks at him. Hank Wiggen stole your pills. He tried to kill himself. Warner stares at House. House stares right back. STARING CONTEST!,"So what happened? He left the bottle open, while he went to get some water? Next time, just take the whole bottle."
"shaking his head slowly Hey Man, you got no right-","See, people remember how Many they've got."
laughs bitterly This isn't about the money.,"Not for you, no. Most reputable stores won't cash your checks after you're dead. But for Lola-well, girls like that, they're all about the money-"
"Don't you say that. She already saved my life. I was dead in Japan and she brought me back, Everything since then, that's gravy, it's more than I deserve.",You owe her.
You owe her. Everything.,"nods So, the attempted suicide, the scaring her to death, that's-what is that, that's-gratitude?"
"I want that baby! House fixes him with a cold glare Even if I'm gone, that's a piece of me, and Lola. Breathing. Walkin' around town. Goin' to baseball games. releases House's coat If there's any more transplant talk from you, or Lola, or anybody else!I won't screw it up this time. I'll take myself out for good. House's glare melts into defeat","nods slowly I'll start treating the Addison's, which will most likely destroy what's left of your kidneys-"
Hey. he looks down at House's pants questioningly,irritatedly Hank Wiggen peed on me. What d'you think these pants are worth on eBay?
"I've got some big-boy diapers in my office, the rep. hands them out like candy.",Is it that bad?
sarcastically No! Not if you like the smell of urine-,"'Course, why should I trust someone who lies about what he's doing Friday night?"
"!Stacy's coming into town this weekend, we're having dinner. Just!catParkng up.","I definitely had pants here. turns to face Wilson Wait a second, is that Stacy the Stripper? I heard she's playing Atlantic City."
"No, Stacy the Constitutional Lawyer. House looks mildly surprised for a second",You thought I couldn't handle this news. Wilson's eyes fall to the floor and he nods. House turns his attention to the bag You talk to her a lot?
No. It's been a long time. House continues staring at the bag If you don't want me to see her-,"What is this, eighth grade? looks at Wilson I'm fine."
!It's fine if you're upset-,suddenly No!
Say hi for me. So!you're okay.,tosses the bag under his desk I'm not the cancer doctor who's lying about the cancer dinner.
You're treating him for Addison's and you don't think it's gonna work?!,He tried to kill himself.
"I know. He's confused. We can have another baby, I can make him understand that. I'm having an abortion. We do the trans-",No.
indignantly I can make decisions about my body.,And he can make decisions about his. He doesn't want your kidney. Lola looks shocked and upset
Lola looks shocked and upset So!he'll die?,!PRobably.
So!he'll die? !PRobably.,"If you keep that appointment, he'll also pRobably die."
"If you keep that appointment, he'll also pRobably die. Lola sobs into his shoulder Keep the baby. He reaches up and awkwardly pats her shoulder. He makes a face as the smell of the urine meets his nose.","!Are you just being polite? She pulls away from him, confused See, my pants are!gestures to his leg"
"Oh, they're all wet. House looks at her, puzzled","!You can't smell that? she shakes her head, and he looks intently at her, processing this."
"laughing Oh God, do we have to go to the lecture?","looking down at Sharon So, you're the new Arnie."
"Dr. House. It's, uh, good to see you. Foreman glares at House",Would you get me a coffee?
She buys lunches! She doesn't-,"Don't worry, you're not gay!you're adventurous! Ducklings roll their eyes"
You think she's gonna prostitute herself? The three of us are that important to her?,"I'm afraid not, no. The groupies sleep with the roadies in order to get to Mick."
The groupies sleep with the roadies in order to get to Mick. And!you're Mick?,"eating off Sharon's plate That was the metaphor I was making, yes."
Why are you here?,"studies Foreman a moment Damn, it's you. All eyes on Foreman, how embarrassing! It's not Addison's. New symptom the inability to smell."
"I was just in Hank's room, and he said it smelled like the men's room at Veteran's Stadium. He was right.",We rejected environmental causes because the wife was healthy.
"If you think of them as one single Patient, add her symptoms to his!Chase nods Cadmium poisoning.",It explains Everything. Even why they had so much trouble getting pregnant.
"Unless they were eating steel and batteries for breakfast. Chase is thinking, watch out!","So, where else is cadmium?"
How'd the ballplayer doing?,Much better.
Too bad about his career.,What d'you mean?
Major League Baseball's collective bargaining agreement requires medical reports on all treatment. Given Hank's history he's not likely to get much leniency. stops outside of her office,Why should they care that he's being treated for Addison's?
suspiciously You're not treating him for Addison's!,My report says I am.
You're lying on the report?!,"Everybody does stupid things, it shouldn't cost them Everything they want in life."
That was amazing!,"I'm telling you, Gravedigger nEver disappoints. Cameron sees a couple pass by, arms around each other."
You Ever been married?,"quietly Well now, let's not ruin a lovely night out by getting personal."
"quietly Well now, let's not ruin a lovely night out by getting personal.","I lived with someone for a while. Looks down at his empty cotton candy cone, then at Cameron's You gonna finish that?"
"Male, spiking fEver, congested chest and coughing up green sputum, pain in breathing","Baffling. Though I vaguely recall a disease called noomonia, nuMania?"
But his X-ray and CT scan show an atypical pattern for pneumonia.,"Pneumonia! That's it. Just a guess here, but are his parents big donors?"
No infiltrate! Just enlarged hilar lymph nodes.,"Tiny unicorns goring his bronParkal tubes would be cooler. And the way you're ignoring my question! wow, they're extremely big donors."
"He's not responding to cefuroxime, his pulsox is dropping much faster than it should for pneumonia, and plus, he's got an odd little rash.","Excessive irritation. He's 12, he's on auto-stroke"
"On his arm. Papular lesion, one centimeter, on top of a long thin scab.","Ah, you need a dermatologist."
He takes it. Fine.,Cuddy. As a special favor to you
"No! Admit it, I got you with the rash.","The rash is a total snooze. takes the chart Unless it's connected to the pneumonia, then it's party time."
"The rash is a total snooze. takes the chart Unless it's connected to the pneumonia, then it's party time.","Purulent sputum, dyspnea, bronPark bilaterally. What causes this kind of rash?"
"Usually means industrial ventilation systems, convention centers. He's twelve years old.",Send off a urine antigen and check if he's joined the Elks. Next?
Next? Fungal.,Excellent. Maybe the lodge went spelunking.
Twelve-year-olds don't have sex.,Their mistake. That's it? Other possibilities?
What if you're thinking about this backwards?,"The rash came first, caused the pneumonia. Nice."
"New Jersey, it's most likely Lyme disease.",All right.
"Gabe, it's important.","Secret club. What's the secret, they're all morons?"
"He fell on something in the attic, scraped his arm, got the rash the next day. Said it smelled really moldy up there.",Fungal pneumonia without the cave. ClEver.
"Sorry, I've gotta go. He hurries off.",These young doctors. It's like they don't care about people. No Manners.
"My fault, pRobably.","That's an interesting accent you have there. I'd say Czech, with about thirty years of Aussie."
You have quite an ear.,"You're Chase's dad. Hard to miss, you know, the big hug and how happy he was to see you. He sips his coffee and smiles."
"You're Chase's dad. Hard to miss, you know, the big hug and how happy he was to see you. He sips his coffee and smiles.",Need a consult.
With a Patient.,Urgent doctor stuff. He leaves.
Urgent doctor stuff. He leaves.,"26-year-old male, sudden loss of the ability to speak --"
Just because you got out of clinic duty doesn't mean Everybody did.,-- to his father. Differential diagnosis?
Differential diagnosis? Chase?,"Dad swoops in, Chase swoops out."
Dad say why he was here?,See?
"You want to get to the bottom of this, you're doing it exactly right. Don't talk to the people involved, drag your buddy away from work for some pointless speculation.","You want to know how two chemicals interact, do you ask them?"
Even I don't like you. He walks off.,"calling after him You know, words can hurt!"
"Felt. Fibers are made of what, cotton?","Hah, hah hah. The team looks over to see House reading a book on rheumatology by Chase's father. Sorry, forgotten how funny your dad was."
Not as funny as you.,High praise.
ParabronParkal thickening. Purile effusions.,"Less obvious, more scary."
"Slightly widened. Oh God, it can be transmitted through infected animal hair. But the gram stain would have shown","No, the cefuroxime would have killed some of it, clouded the result."
What does he have?,Anthrax. This House belonged to old Man Hussein?
He's okay. Sarah gives Jeffrey a hug.,Allergic reaction to the antibiotics?
You really think he's allergic to two antibiotics?,I want to know what Dr. Chase thinks.
It's possible to think he's allergic to both anti,"Oh, I'm sorry! Not you. Understandable mistake. The other Dr. Chase. Chase is not amused."
Necrosis can theoretically take as long as two weeks. Smirk.,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
What do the nodules tell us? Sarcoidosis.,"Excellent. Send an ACE lEvel. If it comes back positive, put him on methotrexate."
"Call the Lancet, because that's one bizarre allergic reaction.","Come on, there's no reason you both can't be wrong. It's not allergy, but it's not coincidence, either. Disease number one set off disease number two."
Anthrax weakened his immune system.,And triggered a dorMant sarcoidosis. Keep him on antibiotics for the anthrax and start him on methotrexate for the sarcoidosis.
Fine. He leaves.,Better go with him. Make sure he doesn't snap and hurt somebody. Foreman follows him.
You're being funny?,Apparently not.
You know why I give money to this hospital? It's the only way to get attention. You see this? He holds up his wrist.,"Is this a magic trick? Because I am a total David Copperfield fan, although that Tornado of Fire, that seemed a little fake"
"Pain in the wrist. Won't go away for months. House pops a Vicodin. Six doctors' brilliant conclusion is to take it easy. I write a check, name goes on a plaque, and forty-eight hours later I've got two MRIs, a bone scan, and a diagnosis carpal tunnel. I'm in surgery that afternoon.","Fascinating story. You thought of adapting it for the stage? His beeper beeps, he goes to get it in his office."
"I love my look at me! love my son, love him more than anything else in the world, and you're going to start paying attention to this case, or I'm going to make things miserable for",Go back to your son's room.
I'm not leaving here until you get your ass in gear,"There's a pRoblem. Jeffrey walks out, and.."
"Uh, he has clinic duty this morning.","No, he doesn't. I rescheduled you guys so you'd be free."
Keep going. House enters.,You page me?
"No, I don't need you.","Oh, come on."
"Gabe's dad found leishManiasis and filariasis on the internet yesterday. They didn't fit then, but now they kind of do.","Sure, except for the nodules and we're not working out of Calcutta General."
The only reason you're thinking auto-immune is because you're a rheumatologist! If you were a proctologist you'd think rectal cancer.,Gotta go with Senior. He literally wrote the book on this one.
"And 100 mg. of cytoxan, it treats most auto-immunes.","We'll give it to him now, before the fat starts dripping out his eyeballs."
Hey! My fingers are numb!,"Your watch is on too tight. Well, how about that! Patient crisis solved."
You're messing with my head.,Your relationship with your dad is messing with your ability to do your job.
Only because you made my dad part of my job.,"Good point. Haven't seen him in years, he flies across the Atlantic to see you"
"Haven't seen him in years, he flies across the Atlantic to see you Pacific.",You breeze by him like he's a Hare Krishna at the airport. You don't Even ask why he's in town.
on the stairs It's pRobably a conference.,PRobably.
How would you feel if I interfered in your personal life?,I'd hate it. That's why I clEverly have no personal life.
I'm going to biopsy his skin lesions.,Good thinking! Prove your dad wrong. That'll solve Everything.
I've got to talk to House about this treatment.,But the Patient's getting better.
In spite of the cytoxan.,"On the other hand, getting better."
Cytoxan makes him more susceptible to infection. The anthrax could relapse and be more resistant.,Better!
"You want a negative test for Every auto-immune disease known to Man? Fine, I'll get them!",Be home by midnight or he can't have the car this weekend. Chase stops by the door. You guys talk? Did he tell you why he's here?
The SLE conference.,Going back to the conference?
Afternoon panel. I hope I can stay awake.,I hope you can get in.
"Lungs, stage four.",You look good.
"I'm not. Came to the States to go to Sloan-Kettering, and to see Dr. Wilson.",What'd he say?
What'd he say? Three months.,But you haven't told Robert. You don't want to burden him because you were such a lousy dad.
I'd prefer you not tell him.,"Yeah, it's better. I'll get to see his face when he reads his dad's obituary."
It's not your business.,I suppose it isn't.
"If we don't stop the nerve deterioration quickly, he'll be paralyzed for life.","Well, luckily, at this rate, that should only last about a week. Okay, so"
Robert was right. You said multiple neurofibromatosis.,"Are you saying that for the chance of a beautiful family moment, or is there some medicine involved?"
"Are you saying that for the chance of a beautiful family moment, or is there some medicine involved? Fits better.",Too bad. I was hoping for the other reason. I was gonna go get my camera. Get a CT scan. His brain this time.
One's always been more than enough for me. House taps him on the shoulder with his cane.,Why didn't you tell me that Rowan Chase was in to see you?
"to the blonde Excuse me. to House Ethics, confidentiality? Does any of this ring a bell?",You could have covered yourself. Called me in for a consult.
It is a juicy piece of gossip. You know what happened? I got all focused on his cancer and lost perspective.,"You can't tell Chase, but I can. What should I do?"
Oh! This is where I give you advice and pretend you're going to listen to it. I like this part. Did Rowan ask you not to tell?,"I promised I wouldn't. My fingers were crossed, though, so I'm wide open."
I was wrong! This is the musing-out-loud part! Do I actually need to be here?,"Telling him, now that's got real entertainment value."
"Hmmm, he might Even cry. On the other hand, there is the do unto others thingy.",Then I should definitely tell him! I'd want to know.
You want to know Everything. There's also the keeping your promises thingy.,"Oh, you nEver run out of thingies. Like that blonde thing you were chatting up."
She's the hospital accountant! We were going over billing procedures!,"Double-entry bookkeeping? Elevator dings, because the elevator wins at comic timing."
What are you going to do?,"Billing procedures. They're so compliCated, aren't they? Wilson rolls his eyes as the doors close."
"No masses, no fibrous tangles, nothing. It's not neurofibromatosis.","Drs. Chase are 0 3. Even when they agree they're wrong. So, next. What else could cause neural damage as well as all the nodules?"
"Doesn't matter. His lesions are in the wrong place, his feet are the one clear spot.",Kid's dad mentioned leishManiasis.
"Yeah, and filariasis, but the throat nodules still don't fit with that.",Two diseases pretty much exclusive to Southeast Asia. What if the anthrax didn't set off the second disease?
We're back at coincidence again?,No. What if something else was the trigger?
Nothing else happened.,We happened.
"We've been through this, it's not an allergy.",I've gotta pee. He leaves.
What did the CT scan tell you?,Nothing. He grabs Jeffrey's bad wrist.
He grabs Jeffrey's bad wrist. Ow!,"On a scale of one to ten, how painful?"
About half as painful as when I punch you in the face.,Don't do that. It'll hurt you. Carpal tunnel surgery obviously didn't work.
Who are you?,The little ones call me Uncle Gregg. Your dad nEver had carpal tunnel. You mentioned two obscure diseases to Dr. Chase. How'd you know about them?
I read about them on the internet.,"So, what'd you search for? Diseases from Asia that don't match my son's symptoms? You heard about them in Asia."
I've nEver been there.,"Well, you pRobably just forgot. Let me refresh your memory. Some remote, dusty village, close quarters, at least a year! starting to come back?"
"Excuse me, what does this have to do with our son?","to Gabe Your dad's pissed off. He should be. Comes here, expecting us to do an extra good job because he gives a whole lot of money to this hospital"
yelling Don't talk to my son like that!,"Just telling him my job, my obligation to this"
Stop! What's going on?,"There's only one thing that you guys have got to do. Tell the truth, or your son will die. How long were you in Asia?"
What does this have to do with my son? But House has left.,"Clue number one If I were Jesus, curing this kid would be as easy as turning water into wine."
"Clue number one If I were Jesus, curing this kid would be as easy as turning water into wine. Demonic possession?","Close, but no wafer. Clue number two Rheumatology Rowan was almost right. It causes auto-immune symptoms."
"Yeah, that's real big in the Jersey suburbs.","It's leprosy. Run a FITE stain, it'll be positive. Daddy hung out on the wrong kind of Indian ashram."
"But it's obviously dorMant in the dad, how could the kid catch it?","It's not dorMant in the dad, it's just slow. Damaged his ulnar nerve, was misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel. NEver trust doctors. Run a FITE stain."
No wonder he got anthrax. The leprosy weakened his immune system.,"Vicious circle. The leprosy made him vulnerable to the anthrax, and the anthrax treatment put the leprosy in overdrive."
"But the antibiotics we gave him, they cure leprosy.","Yeah, that's where the trouble starts."
So the cure's killing him!,"to Cameron I want you to call down to Carville, Louisiana, home of the last leper colony in the lower 48. Get them to send up some thalidomide."
Get them to send up some thalidomide. Thalidomide?,"Twelve-year-olds don't have sex, right? So he can't be pregnant. Make the call. to Rowan I need to speak to your boy. Chase is alone in the office with House."
Why does Everybody need to know my business?,"People like talking about people. Makes us feel superior. Makes us feel in control. And sometimes, for some people, knowing some things makes them care. He takes some Vicodin."
"I'd tell you my dad left, my mum drank herself to death! you gonna care about me more?","Cameron would. Me, I just like knowing stuff. pause I know you hate your dad, but I'm gonna tell you something"
"I don't hate him. I loved him until I figured out that it hurts a lot less to just not care. You don't expect him to turn up to your football match? No disappointments. You don't expect a call on your birthday, don't expect to see him for months? No disappointments. You want us to go make up? Sink a few beers together, nice family hug? I've given him enough hugs. He's given me enough disappointments.",Okay.
Okay. That's it?,That's it. Chase leaves.
I need a doctor. I can't move my leg!,"32-year-old female, paralysis and sEvere pain in her right quad. Go."
How'd she get to you?,She's the CEO of Sonyo Cosmetics. Three assistants and fifteen VPs checked out who should be treating her. Who da Man? I da Man. I always suspected.
"Dr. House, I beliEve that they're right, and",Stop talking.
Stop talking. What?,"You read one of those negotiating books, didn't you?"
"Dr. House, are you saying that she doesn't have a clot or are you saying that if she does have a clot she doesn't need blood thinners and an angiogram?","Chase, put her on blood thinners, do an angiogram. Cameron looks triumphant. When that comes back negative, MRI the spine. If that's clean, cut her open and biopsy the leg."
"If that's clean, cut her open and biopsy the leg. Excellent suggestion.","Read less, more TV."
Hmm. He walks off.,Say ah.
Say ah. Ah.,"No, really belt it out, like you're gonna throw up."
Ah! He coughs in House's face.,"Perfect. Okay, that's it. We should know in a couple of days what's growing in your son's throat. The dad doesn't say anything in response. Hello?"
He can't talk.,Excuse me?
He had knee surgery.,Right!
"About a year ago, and then he couldn't talk.","Right, yeah, well, that happens."
"AAH! The dad looks frightened, but doesn't say anything.","Just wanted to see if your dad, uh, sorry. He leaves."
I need you to wear your lab coat.,I need two days of outrageous sex with someone obscenely younger than you. Like half your age.
Wear the coat.,Man oh Man. Someone got spanked real good this morning.
"Guy gives $100 million to cure cancer, pretty small concession to wear a lab coat.",Cure cancer. Is the hospital getting out of the dull business of treating Patients?
You know that's not what he's doing.,I know exactly what he's doing. He's using us to run clinical trials.
"Oh, shame on him! Saving lives like that!","entering his office It's unethical. Cuddy follows. Oh, are you coming in, too? I thought I had you convinced."
Clinical trials save thousands of lives.,He's using Patients as guinea pigs.
Pharmaceutical companies do that Every day.,"Are we a pharmaceutical company? We're gonna wind up pressuring desperate Patients into choices that are bad for them, good for us. You're gonna compromise Patient care."
Who the hell am I talking to? Suddenly ethical lapses are a major concern for you?,What's interesting is it suddenly doesn't bother you.
"So, if you ignore ethics to save one person it's admirable, but if you do it to save a thousand you're a bastard. All he's done is taken your game and gone pro.",He's not going to kill a few Patients. He's going to kill this hospital.
We should introduce ourselves. It couldn't hurt.,getting coffee Make him a bundt cake. Patient hit a ten on the pain scale. What would explain that?
"There was no clot in her leg, the angio was totally clean.",What about the muscle biopsy?
My Aunt ELisalives in Philiadelphia.,"Oh, it's storytime! Let me get my baba."
"Her normal temperature is 96.2, not 98.6 like you and me. If her temperature were 98.6, she'd have a fEver. I'm just wondering if you think we could apply the same logic to Carly's sed rate.",That's absurd. I love it.
"If 15 is high for Carly, then she has inflammation.","Which could, in turn, mean cancer. I'll talk to Wilson. Next time, skip Aunt Elisa."
"You're pRobably talking about a primary bone cancer. Can be tricky to detect, you'll need a bone scan",That's why I'm talking to an oncologist.
"Sure, I've nothing better to do besides departmental meetings and budget reports! new ChairMan of the Board, you know.",Oh! I hadn't heard.
Right. Clinical trials!,Completely unethical.
And a very bad omen for you. There's not much money in curing African sleeping sickness.,"No, I have seen Every scary movie Ever made."
Billionaires buy movie studios to get laid. They buy hospitals to get respect.,And the reason you want respect?
To! get laid.,Okay then.
"Oh, come on. You know how good you have it here.","Yes, I'm the big poobah, the big cheese, the go-to guy."
"You do the cases you want to do, when you want to do them. You're not going to get that anywhere else.","Relax, I've been through three regime changes in this hospital. Every time, same story."
"Just keep your head down, that's all I'm saying. And put on your coat.","It itches. Wilson sighs and leaves. House calls after him. So, are you going to do this bone scan for me or what?"
Yes. House throws a Vicodin up in the air and catches it in his mouth.,"Dr. Simpson! Did you hear? New Management. I'm thinking about switParkng to orthopedics. How much do you guys get for massage now, without the happy ending?"
"Dr. House, what do you want?",You remember a guy named Van Der Meer? Not a big talker. You fixed his ACL.
"Well, not according to my medical malpractice premiums.",Didn't get hypertensive during surgery? No strokes? Maybe some connectivity loss?
"What, you're going to get involved now?",I'm not involved. Guy brought his son into the clinic.
I didn't touch the son. I'm not taking any responsibility there.,The son's fine. Can't shut him up. The dad show any signs of cortical disease? Wernicke's?
"No. Nothing. And that's why we settled because we couldn't find anything. The guy got over a million dollars, don't tell me he's complaining.",He's not saying boo.
"There is another way. We could do a virtual colonoscopy. Basically, we do a CT scan of your colon. It's non-invasive, but it's very expensive. I assume that's not a pRoblem. Carly looks at him. Say yes.",Mr.
Virtual colonoscopy was clean. No colon cancer.,What happened to a regular old-fashioned colonoscopy?
She was uncomfortable doing any more tests! I had to convince her to do that one!,Do you get that often? Women would rather die than get naked with you?
Women would rather die than get naked with you? She's scared.,But not of tests. Just embarrassing ones.
Just embarrassing ones. Yeah.,"It's not an inflammatory process, it's not a clot because Chase's angio says so, and it's not cancer because her toosh is perfect."
Maybe it's worth looking into,I thought you said Carly's angio was clean.
It was clean. House puts the scans up on his light board.,You guys see the pRoblem here? Foreman gets up to get a closer look.
"There's no indication of any abnormalities. No lesions, no spurs, no masses",Her toes are screwed up. They're backwards. Do you guys know how much surgery it's going to take to swap them back?
What are you talking about?,Either she literally has two left feet or you angio-ed the wrong leg.
gets up to look That's impossible. It can't be the wrong,Or maybe it was Jenny! How come some resident signed this radiology form? Were you Even in the room?
I'll redo her angio straight away,"You'll do nothing! Foreman, you do the angiogram. Foreman leaves."
"Foreman did a thoracentesis to drain the fluid from her lungs. They sent the fluid to the lab, it'll be back in a few hours. You'll be happy to know that Chase's mistake didn't cost her. Angio rEvealed no clot.",I'm thrilled.
"Okay, see, now you're just being stubborn. It's cold, perfectly good excuse to wear your lab coat.",Carly needs a heart transplant.
Thoracentesis rEvealed a transudate?,Haven't gotten it back yet.
"Her MUGA scan, what was the ejection fracture? Maybe you could treat it, surgically.",Haven't done the MUGA.
How do you know she needs a heart transplant?,I got my aura read today. It said someone close to me had a broken heart.
Since when do I need the secret pass code to talk to you?,I can't tell you anything. Professional responsibility.
Like that matters to you.,"Not my professional responsibility, yours. New regime, you gotta keep your head down, too."
"Now, that's good thinking, because I was going to go right to Cuddy and rat you out as soon as you were done talking.","I'm not saying you want to, I'm saying you'd be obligated to."
"Because of my position on the Board? House looks at him. Because of my position on the transplant committee? House says nothing. Hey, you brought this up for a reason. You need to talk to me.",I can't.
You sure you're doing the right thing?,I've come up with a few really great rationalizations. Chase and Cameron walk up.
"Thoracentesis rEvealed a transudate. Wilson looks, well, amazed. We did an echo. She's in sEvere congestive heart failure. She needs a heart transplant. We'll get her on the list immediately",She's already on the list.
You're Dr. House. I found a picture of you online at a conference,You need a heart transplant.
"I run, I work out, I","You cut yourself. PRobably highly ritualized. You play the same Sarah MacLaughlin song over and over while you do it, pRobably works better than anti-depressants."
I don't understand how that has to,You're a high-powered bulimic.
Three times a week.,"In about an hour, there's going to be an emergency meeting of the transplant committee to discuss where you fall on the list should a new heart become available."
So you're here to tell me I have just a few hours to live?,Unless I lie to the committee.
Why are you here doing this to me? What do you want?,I want to know what's right.
"Am I worth it? You think I'm pathetic. Has a good job, Everything in the world, but she just doesn't like the way that she looks","Oh, stop hiding! Carly looks taken aback at his yelling. I'm asking you if you want to live or die, you can't Even say that!"
What do you want me to do? Cry?,Yes!
crying I don't want to die. I don't.,This 32-year-old female was admitted by my staff because of paralysis and pain in her right thigh.
"Uh, Dr. House, I'm confused by your time and date stamps. It appears that you put Carly on the transplant list before you did these tests.",I had a hunch.
You don't have hunches. You know.,"Look, if the tests had come back differently, obviously I would have taken her off the lists, but on the long shot!"
Is there any exclusion criteria we should know about?,CAT scan rEvealed no tumors and Dr. Wilson found no trace of cancer.
What about any other criteria?,No atherosclerotic vascular disease
Are there any,"No pneumonia, no bacteriemia, no Hep-B or C or any other letters."
Substance abuse? Any history of,"No alcohol, no drugs."
"Any psyParkatric conditions, history of depression","She's a little blue, but turns out she needs a heart transplant. Cuddy glances at Vogler, who gives her a pointed look."
"Dr. House, if you subvert or mislead this committee, you will be subject to disciplinary action. pause","Dr. Cuddy, do you have any reason to think that I would lie?"
I simply want you to answer the question! Is there anything on the recipient exclusion criteria that would disqualify your Patient from getting a heart?,looks at Wilson and Vogler before answering No.
looks at Wilson and Vogler before answering No.,Beautiful organ donor weather.
"in his best hands-on-hips confrontation voice You lied, didn't you?",I nEver lie.
I nEver lie. Big mistake.,Then you should have voted against putting her on the list.
You're my friend.,"Oh, jeez. Have some backbone. If you think I'm wrong, do something."
"Wait, you're getting mad at me for sticking up for you?",You value our friendship more than your ethical responsibilities.
Our friendship is an ethical responsibility. House's beeper beeps. What is it?,My Patient's getting a heart.
They just stopped Carly's heart. And your dumb Patient,"They're all oh, the guy who can't talk."
"Mr. Van Der Meer, he scheduled an appointment to see you.","Oooh, goody."
I wanted you to know Chase is worried you're going to fire him.,"It's bad enough that screw-ups cost lives. Now we've got Vogler, screw-ups cost jobs. I want Chase scared. I want him doing Everything he can to protect his job."
"Dr. House, if you were in his position wouldn't you be more likely to perform well if you were reassured and","Oh, will you stop it with the book! Why are you doing this?"
I'm not doing anything.,You're Manipulating Everyone.
"People! dismiss me. Because I'm a Woman, because I'm pretty, because I'm not aggressive. My opinions shouldn't be rejected just because people don't like me.",They like you. Everyone likes you. He starts to walk away.
Do you? dramatic pause. House stares at Cameron blankly. I have to know.,No.
quietly Okay. She walks away.,"looking at his watch 5 hours, 23 minutes, that's fast."
Is that good or bad?,"It depends. Either surgery went really well, or it ended really abruptly."
Textbook. She'll outlive us all.,Thank you.
She'll outlive us all. Thank you.,"So, sing for me."
"So, sing for me. Dad looks at House, and then grabs his laptop. Oh, no, no, no, no! come on, look. When you had your surgery, you were intubated. Surgeon stuck a tube down your throat. Now, it nEver happens, and it's nEver caught, but it happens. Your vocal chords were paralyzed. I treated the spastic dysphonia with Botox. Ironically, a substance that tightens Every other corner of your face actually loosens the tongue. I have healed you. You can talk. Dad shakes his head. Oh, well. House goes to leave, and as he does! BOOOO! Dad grasps his laptop in fear, but no scream. Okay, you don't have to say anything, it can be our little secret. If you can talk, blink twice. Dad stares at House. But you're not going to, because you think you won't be entitled to the money you won in the settlement with Simpson. Yesterday I would have said you'd have to give the money back. Today! hospital's come into a lot of money, mum's the word. Dad blinks twice, and House smiles. Dad smiles back, and all is cheery in Exam Room one.",Hey.
Hey. Hey.,"I know the cardiologist has given you some guidelines, schedule of medications, and a strict diet just what someone with an eating disorder needs."
Fried Parkcken from the Carnegie Deli. You're kidding.,"Yeah. Actually, I got it downstairs. Carly laughs a bit."
"Why did you fight for me? You risked so much, and you hardly know me.","You're my Patient. Don't screw it up. Carly nods, and House leaves."
"You're my Patient. Don't screw it up. Carly nods, and House leaves.","over the music Love this part! switches to air drums, and! Vogler turns off his music Okay. He ruined it."
"Just wanted to stop by and introduce myself. I'm Vogler, new ChairMan of the Board. In a way, I guess that makes me your boss.",I am sorry about the lab coat thing. The dry cleaners destroyed it. Vogler laughs and sits.
"That was my very first heart transplant meeting, very exciting.","Trust me. Six Flags, way more exciting."
Patient's very lucky to have such a passionate doctor who stands up for what he beliEves in.,Sweet of you to say.
"Yeah. 'Fraid you've been duped, though. He pulls out the bottle of ipecac from his pocket. The nurse found this in the Patient's purse. pause","Oh, my. If only I'd known."
Tough being a doctor. You've got all that power. The power to play God.,"Yes, I don't envy the transplant committee their responsibility. They basically would have been forced to kill that poor girl. I'm not sure I could have done that."
"This is not a game to me, Dr. House.",No.
I've got Cuddy. Right.,And Wilson.
We're in a meeting.,Need the Lawyer.
Who'd you kill?,"Nobody, but it's not Even lunch."
What? They want you to examine a sick person? This is a public relations nightmare. Don't think our staff do that kind of thing around here! this place would be crawling with sick people!,"I'm a doctor, I'm not a lapdog for the feds I don't play fetch."
"You have three choices hire a Lawyer to fight the order, treat the guy, or go to jail for contempt. Up to you.","grabs the papers back Jail. You'd like that. No more naughty schoolgirl. to Vogler Conjugal visit, that's her new fantasy. Vogler tries not to laugh as House leaves."
We're not leaving until he's gone or you show me one good reason for keeping him.,"He's really out of it, huh?"
looking at the file He had his stomach pumped! Why would they do that?,Rule out poisoning.
Huh. Not the typical first guess.,"No, the first guess was faking it. Patient's a federal witness, reluctant, I'm assuming. He's also an 8 on the Glasgow coma scale."
"Any recent history of head trauma? Bad car accident, fall?","They tell me no, but do an MRI to be sure. They round the corner to Diagnostics, Bill is standing by the door."
"Metabolic causes. Liver, kidney, diabetes","Check for Everything, feds are paying. We're gonna turn a profit on this one, boys."
"Dr. House, Bill Arnello. He shakes House's hand. I'm a Lawyer, I represent Mr. Smith. What's wrong with him?",Do I come to you with my pRoblems?
He's also my brother.,"What, you changed your name? Smith wasn't good enough for you?"
"His name's Joey, he's my only brother.","He's important to you, got it."
"I want you to do your job. Diagnose him, fix him, and keep him here.",We're a bit of a specialized hospital. We generally only deal with Patients when they're actually sick.
"If you release my brother to the government, and he does what they want, Even if you fix him, he's dead. I need time to convince him of that. He shuts off the stop. Good news is, if you screw up you don't have to worry about a malpractice suit. If he's dead, one by one, I'll take away the things you love 'till there's nothing left. Elevator opens, House leaves.","So, on the Mafia thing, that's a yes."
Bleeding around his brain caused pressure inside his head which caused the coma.,looking at the scan These look like pseudomembranes. Those take time to form. If it was an old injury it wouldn't have caused the coma.
"Subdural hematoma placed where this one is, it could have caused his coma.",What about his liver?
"I say we evacuate the cavity, see if he wakes up.","The neurologist thinks it's his brain, wants to open up his head. Frankly, I'm shocked! You get to use the big boy drill and Daddy's big red toolbox."
"He's okay now, he can leave.",I'm not releasing him.
Because the brother doesn't want you to?,"Or because he had an unexplained coma, which sounds better?"
The hematoma caused the coma.,"That's a catchy diagnosis, you could dance to that."
"I think Chase is right. It still should be evacuated, but it's not an immediate threat.",Cameron's my girl.
I'd release him.,Are you disagreeing with me because
I'm disagreeing because that's my medical opinion.,Of course it is.
"Of course it is. But unless I've been named as the fourth part of the Axis of Evil, invaded and occupied, this is still not a democracy. He's staying. Send for Hepatitis serologies and an autoimmune panel. He enters the clinic.","Hey. I'm with you. Old enough to drink, old enough to do something really stupid and make yourself a baby."
He's my brother. I'm watParkng him while my parents are in Barbados. He's having trouble breathing and there's a lot of wheezing.,"listing to the kid's breathing with his stethoscope Whistling, technically. Upper airways, nose."
"If he's got the croup, that could become meningitis, right?",Absolutely. He leans over the kid.
I was just studying and all of a sudden I hear him crying and sounding all weird. My parents are going to kill me. House reaches into the kid's nose with tweezers.,I doubt it.
You don't know them.,"No, I doubt you were studying while your parents were away."
"No, I doubt you were studying while your parents were away. He retriEves a tiny toy policeMan from the kid's nose. Hello, Officer. You might want to rinse this off before you let him play with it again. His beeper beeps.",What happened? Where is he?
"Vogler called admitting, admitting called Justice, Justice came and took him away.",And who called Vogler? All the ducklings look at each other.
D-D-D-D-Dr. House in the House! Impeccable timing as always.,You had no authority to release my Patient.
"Dr. House, from what I understand, your",From what you understand? He's not your Patient how the hell do you understand anything?
He's not your Patient how the hell do you understand anything? That's sad.,You're not Even a doctor.
John Smith is here only because of court order. I had the records faxed to the Judge she rescinded the order.,"Why bother, just to piss me off?"
Keeping the government off our ass. Hmm. Yeah. House's beeper beeps. That makes no sense for a public institution.,Okay. turns to leave
turns to leave Okay what?,"Okay, sir. Carry on. He leaves."
"35-year-old male, vital signs are stable now. Gave him 2 liters en route. Just released from here two hours ago. Cuddy and Vogler walk up.","So, your junior G-Man badge isn't looking so good."
His liver's worse.,Comatose?
Serology tests came back positive for Hep-C.,Hep-C is a chronic condition. You don't think this is an acute situation?
"Coma, vomiting, abdominal pain, Hep-C explains Everything.",Except for the suddenness of the onset.
What's wrong with the timing?,You get home one night.
"He also has high estrogen lEvels in his blood. That's indicative of a chronic condition, not acute.",One test. What do his other liver tests tell us?
Uh-huh. And why is her test better than mine?,Because she's cuter. Cameron looks uncomfortable. Though it's close. Do a liver biopsy. When the results come back we'll know what we're looking at.
"Why wait to treat the Hep-C? If I'm right, Joey gets better that much faster.","Right. Then he gets to testify, and you get a gold star from Cuddy."
Then what's the downside? Or is that the downside.,Do I have a reason for not wanting you to get any stars?
You're off the case. What? Why?,Somebody told Vogler that I lied to the transplant committee.
You think I did?,You're too careful. You wouldn't jump ship unless you knew what was in the water.
"Stop, you're embarrassing me.",But I want Vogler to think I think it's you.
"Ah, this is all my fault.",Took another homework break with Betty Lou?
"No, last week I showed him a magic trick.",Pulled a quarter out of his nose. It's a classic.
Bill enters. Dr. House.,Got a crisis here!
"to kid Stop! Kid shuts up, allowing House to pull a firefighter out of his nose.",It's a neat trick.
You have to beliEve you'll actually hurt them.,Ah.
Your people insulted my brother.,"What, they put roMano in the parmesan cheese shaker again?"
Said he was a crackhead or a homo or something.,Those idiots.
"There were rumors, but Joey nEver said anything about!. If people find out he's being treated for Hep-C? Feds get that chart, someone says something to somebody, word'll get out. And then Joey's Manhood, his rep is destroyed.",You're worried about how his coworkers will react in the Walmart in Des Moines.
"He's not going into Witness Protection, I won't let that happen.","Listen, I don't know if you know about this, but mob businesses sometimes keep two sets of books."
"One legit, one not.",Exactly.
You jerking my chain?,"Doctors are busy, sometimes they forget to write things down, it happens all the time."
"Thanks. He turns to leave. Oh, and whatEver you're not giving him for whatEver he doesn't have, is that going to fix him?",I doubt it.
I doubt it.,On your way to polish Vogler's car?
"Gone are the days of the grumpy old doc seeing Patients in the basement of his House, getting paid a few Parkckens.",How will I eat?
"You know what Cuddy has been locked in with Vogler about all day today, and yesterday?",Floor polish costs through the roof?
You. Her secretary's been to the photocopier all day with your records. It's all they're looking at in there. House looks shocked.,"My car has been stolen. They look around for it, and see!"
Or rein-CAR-nated. !a 1965 red Corvette in House's Parking space. Wilson picks up a piece of paper stuck in the windshield wiper. Pink slip. A gift from the Arnello brothers.,"smiling You know, they're gangsters, sure, but they're thoughtful, too."
You can't keep it. It's graft.,"No, no, no, no."
So there's nothing wrong with this. Right.,"Damn. '65. Perfectly restored. What do you think a guy like Joey would do if someone turned down a gift? That's kind of an insult, isn't it?"
He might hurt you. It's definitely possible.,I'm screwed. Gotta take the car.
Varices. You see it with chronic Hep-C all the time.,entering Biopsy's back. Two findings. Number one lymphocytic infiltrate and no bridging fibrosis.
"Well, whatEver's killing him is not Hep-C. It's acute.",Who said that? I forget. What are you doing here? I told you you were off the case.
"Right. Your diabolic plan to convince the evil genius he's in the clear so he'll let his guard down and make a fatal mistake, sure.","Well, it's clearly not going to work now."
What evil genius?,"If we knew that, then we wouldn't need a diabolic plan now, would we?"
"Oh, what? One of us?","No, you guys love me too much."
"All right, look, if it's not the Hep-C, then what's the pRoblem? What's causing the liver failure?",Finding number two toxins.
No. He's only 30 years old and his job doesn't expose him to heavy metals or environmental,"He's a 30-year-old mobster. He doesn't have a job that results in accidental exposure to toxins, he has a job that results in intentional exposure to toxins. Someone's poisoned him."
"He's a 30-year-old mobster. He doesn't have a job that results in accidental exposure to toxins, he has a job that results in intentional exposure to toxins. Someone's poisoned him.","WhatEver this toxin is, it's doing its job and fast. How long do we have until the next round of test results?"
"What, in two hours?","There is another way. Relax, it's kosher."
"You absolutely do, and I absolutely have the right to humiliate you for it. House enters the lab.",Anything?
"White blood count's low pRobably a result of the illness, nothing to connect to the liver.",Is he a smoker?
Let me check. House goes to look at the chest x-ray.,Early signs of emphysema. He's been smoking at least a dozen years.
18. You got that from the white count?,"Nope, got that from the chest x-ray. White count just tells me he's quitting. He goes to look over Cameron's shoulder, who looks uncomfortable."
Where did you get the money.,"Cancel the thumb screws, I've got our culprit."
"Cancel the thumb screws, I've got our culprit. Who?","Not who, Hu."
"Not who, Hu. Huh?",Thanks for playing along.
"So, the mobster's good to go?","I'll keep him overnight, then let the feds know he's good to rat out whoEver he wants."
Brother won't be happy.,Maybe have to give back the car.
You should let Vogler tell the feds.,Why?
"Because it matters to him. Because you humiliated him the first time Joey was released. You think you should still be in third there, ace?",He humiliated himself.
"And because your job depends on the kind of mood Vogler's in at the end of his marathon with Cuddy. Seriously, Man, have you Ever driven an automobile before? There are four gears, you know.",The '66 came with a Shut Up button.
The '66 came with a Shut Up button.,It is my medical opinion that the Patient is healthy and can be released.
to House I see you've found out what we're meeting about.,You're having a meeting?
"Well, whatEver the reason, the coat looks good on you. looks at the chart Chai Hu lozenges cause this kind of liver failure, no way!","Not by themselves, but in combination with the Interferon it's like gas to a flame."
"Not by themselves, but in combination with the Interferon it's like gas to a flame. What Interferon?",For the Hep-C.
For the Hep-C. What Hep-C?,Oops.
Is hiding a mobster's Hep-C that important?,Is letting the feds know Everything that important? House's beeper beeps.
"You know, you are a piece of work, Even now.",Ed!
Ed! Edward.,Joey's back in a coma.
"Worse than before, he's on a ventilator.","Question is, why? It's not his brain, it's not a toxin. Our friend Babe helped with that one. So what else?"
"The Hep-C. We nEver really treated it, we stopped the Interferon when it started poisoning his liver.",Am I going to have to write a song about it? His chronic Hep-C was not bad enough to produce these symptoms.
The estrogen lEvel indiCates it is.,IndiCates something else entirely.
They're running a trial on dogs at St. Sebastian's in Philadelphia. I'll make the call.,as the three others start to leave What else could cause his estrogen lEvel to be that high?
"Maybe there's nothing up there, I watched him like a hawk. Kid cries and screams.",Pretty sure you didn't.
I didn't let him play with any more little toys.,Thus forcing him to shove a big one up there.
He's not too smart.,"Genetics is a powerful force. On the other hand, maybe he's smarter than you think."
What's going on?,Just give me a second.
I don't know.,Just tilt his head back.
Your brother was sending in teams to save the cat. Wow.,"Sometimes the simplest answer! He trails off in thought, and Occam's Razor strikes again!"
"Sometimes the simplest answer! He trails off in thought, and Occam's Razor strikes again!",Most types of coma you just don't snap out of. Chase enters.
"He's not snapping out of this one, he's not improving. You crossed out estrogen, you've got an explanation?","Yes, I have. A very simple one."
A very simple one. And?,It's private.
You think I'm the one running to Vogler.,"You're currently top of the list. Toxic comas, person's away from the cause long enough and they recover."
"The feds checked for poisons, we checked for poisons. I didn't do it.","It's not a poison, then."
"An allergy, then. Did you hear me?",How about a food sensitivity?
"All of his food is strictly controlled. There's no correlation between his meals and his condition. He had steak and potatoes before the first coma, and the hospital served fish sticks before the second one. You can trust me.","PRoblem is, if I can't trust you, I can't trust your statement that I can trust you. But thanks anyway, you've been a big help."
"PRoblem is, if I can't trust you, I can't trust your statement that I can trust you. But thanks anyway, you've been a big help.",So where did you get the money?
So where did you get the money? What?,Someone paid you off.
"What are you talking about? It wasn't poison, you told us that it",You're talking about poison. I'm talking about payoff. Graft.
Leave him alone.,You paid the marshal off.
I didn't pay him to poison my brother.,"No, it just worked out that way."
I gave the guy some money to get him some decent food.,Better than fish sticks? I'm thinking steak.
We asked for pasta. Those stupid feds could care less,He had steak before both comas.
That's it? He stays off the red meat and he's going to be fine?,"Yes. If I'm right, and we stop the current treatment, he gets better. If we stop the current treatment and I'm wrong, he dies."
Why would you be wrong?,His estrogen lEvel.
What is it?,It's called estrogen.
"Joey's taking estrogen? What, he wants a sex change?","No, nothing like that. It's called Male Flame. It's pRobably more consumer friendly in the original Parknese. It's an herbal aphrodisiac marketed to gay men."
"Oh, here we go.",And sold on the same website that sells his Chai Hu lozenges. Guess what's in it? Starts with an e.
"You want to get hit, too?",That would be quite a trick.
sitting next to House Joey is not gay.,"Well, maybe not gay, but certainly delightful."
It's almost like you're scared that it might be true. You're wrong.,"Okay. Then don't stop the treatment. starts to leave But if you're wrong, he dies."
"Okay. House nods to Chase, who stops the medicine. He nEver said anything to me about it, not once.","That's what I love about you mob guys so tolerant of others, so accepting."
Vogler wants to fire you. Lose the whole department.,"Good thing you fought for me, though, right?"
He threatened to fire me. She sits.,"I'm sorry. So, how long do I have? I've a lot of personal stuff to pack up. I assume you're going to want to throw a party."
"I told him I know where the bodies are buried, the stuff he needs to know that's not in the books. Told him he can't ditch me.","He's only keeping you on because you know the secret handshakes. He's a quick study. Six months, he'll have the moves down. Then he won't need you any more."
I'll deal with that then.,So I stay.
Yes. But some things are going to change.,Profits. New world order.
New world order. Huh.,Everything's about profits.
"Yeah, that's real new. You could rent out the Corvette Every once in a while, or lend it to a friend.","That would be easy, and it would be wrong."
But Cuddy stood up for you.,To a point.
To what point?,I gotta do six more clinic hours a month. So do two of them. nods to the Ducklings on the other side of the wall
Why only two?,'Cause one of them's gone.
"Only 10 more seconds, you got it. Jessica falls to the ground. Jessica, Jessica! He turns her over on her back. Jessica! He listens for her heart beat. CGI of her heart beating fast, and then stopping. Oh, my God! Hey, go to the office, get Miss Parsons. Now! Some kid runs. Mr. Conroy calls 911 on his cell. I'm on a playground at Finley Elementary. One of my students is having a heart attack. Yeah, she's ten. Don't you think I know that? Just send the damn ambulance! He starts chest compressions. Come on, wake up, sweetie.",You Ever see an infected pierced scrotum?
"Um, no, but I know a few people on whom I'd like to see it happen. We need to talk.","Well, if pain's what you're after the penis is really the way to go. I'd recommend the apadravya."
We're not talking.,Oh? Sounded like we were.
"No, you're attempting to avoid talking because you know what I want to talk about.",Nipples?
You need to get rid of one of your people.,Absolutely.
"There's no way out on this. You may as well get it over with as fast as you can, like ripping off a band-aid.",Only instead of a two-cent piece of tape and gauze it's a huMan being.
Like you care.,"Like you don't. The elevator opens, rEvealing Cameron."
We have a referral from Dr. Linkowitz.,Don't know him.
He knows you.,What's the pRoblem?
What's the pRoblem? Heart attack.,Definitely don't know him.
Ten year olds do not have heart attacks. It's gotta be a mistake.,Right. The simplest explanation is she's a forty-year-old lying about her age. Maybe an actress trying to hang on.
That's because of her depression.,"That's what five pediatricians, two nutritionists, and a psychologist said. The heart attack would seem to indiCate that they missed something."
"Syndrome X could cause a stroke, but I don't know about a heart attack.","Could, if her blood pressure was high enough."
"Which is likely, considering her weight.",It fits the symptoms.
"It's really bad, especially at night. It's like my heart is on fire, like it's, uh, oh, I don't know, like it's!",Burning?
Burning? Exactly!,"Hmm, sounds almost like heartburn."
"So, can you give me something?",Like a thesaurus?
Like a thesaurus? What?,I take it you nEver mentioned this during any of your prenatal visits.
Prenatal? I'm not pregnant.,"Sorry, you don't get to make that call unless you have a stethoscope. Union rules."
"I know when I'm pregnant, all right? I have six kids. That's why my husband had a vasectomy and we use condoms.","Vasectomies can rEverse themselves, condoms break."
"Okay. She hops off the table and gestures to herself. This is what a Woman is supposed to look like. Okay, we're not just skin and bones. We have flesh. We have curves.",You have little people inside you.
"I guess I must have just been brainwashed by the media, and all those years of medical training. Damn right.",Let's see if I can find some antacids while the nurse gets some blood.
"Let's see if I can find some antacids while the nurse gets some blood. Blood, why?","The heartburn, gotta make sure it's not spreading."
"So, any thoughts?",On what? Sharon's plan for Gaza?
Who you're gonna let go.,I'm thinking I can convince Vogler it would be more cost-efficient to let me keep all of them.
"Yeah, you should be able to pull that off. Most billionaires aren't very good with numbers.","It will be more cost-efficient once I've grabbed Cameron's ass, called Foreman a spade, and Chase! well, I can grab his ass, too."
Separate or together?,Together. House leaves Wilson to pay for lunch.
"Oh, please. Save your pathetic insincerity for your boyfriend. House walks up.","You're wrong. She is, in fact, pathetically sincere. And they didn't screw it up."
Who are you?,"I'm from the lab. The blood tests showed your daughter wasn't hypoglycemic, which means her psychosis wasn't caused by anything these doctors did."
So then what was it caused by?,"I have no idea, but you'll be happy to hear it can't be cured by diet or exercise."
"I have no idea, but you'll be happy to hear it can't be cured by diet or exercise.",What else could cause uncontrollable rage in a ten-year-old?
Nothing that could also cause a heart attack. House starts to write on the whiteboard.,I assume I don't have to point out that now would be an extremely good time for one of you to distinguish yourself with a brilliant idea.
Have you Ever met a plastic surgeon who was in their right mind? Cameron looks really pissed.,She hasn't had liposuction.
She hasn't had liposuction. Thank you.,But what about some other ridiculous obesity treatment?
But what about some other ridiculous obesity treatment? Like what?,Diet pills can cause heart attacks and blood clots.
Her tox screen was negative.,Wouldn't show over-the-counter weight loss drugs.
"sarcastically Yeah, she thinks her daughter's perfect just the way she is.","She's lying. Okay, you two, heparin and warfarin to prEvent further clotting. And you, to Foreman find those pills."
"She's lying. Okay, you two, heparin and warfarin to prEvent further clotting. And you, to Foreman find those pills.",shaking the bottle of Vicodin Not diet pills.
"If you're gonna fire someone, go ahead and do it, but don't treat us like lab rats, testing how long it takes us to get us at one another's throats.",So what should I do?
I don't give a damn what you do.,"Yes, I had noticed your complete indifference. You don't Even offer a medical opinion any more. Who would you fire?"
Not my call.,"I want your opinion. Foreman starts to leave. Fine, it's you. Foreman turns around. Either way, you're making a choice."
"Either way, you're making a choice. Chase.",slightly puzzled Wh- Because he screwed up an angio a month ago?
Anyone can make a mistake.,"Right, it's the money. You resent it, but you're going to tell me he doesn't need the job."
He doesn't appreciate the job.,He was ready to go three rounds with Cameron for it.
"He wants the job. He just doesn't appreciate it. There's nothing wrong with just wanting to hang out, but this is not the place to do it.",I'm surprised.
You thought I'd pick Cameron?,I didn't think you'd pick at all.
I didn't think you'd pick at all.,I guess he's not the rise above the fray guy he likes to think he is.
You practically forced it out of him.,"He's scared of losing his job, just like Everyone else."
I've been thinking. You've made it quite clear that you're miserable here,I am not miserable. They enter the clinic.
You're not happy.,And you are?
"With! my job, yes.",I am exactly where I want to be doing exactly what I want to do.
I think I sense a hint of sarcasm there. Why don't you pick yourself? Quit?,looking at charts Hmmm! I was wrong.
About Vogler or Foreman?,Mrs. Hernandez's pregnancy tests.
Who's Mrs. Hernandez?,Either a Woman carrying an alien baby or your newest Patient. Wilson grabs the chart.
"The tumor is extremely large, at least thirty pounds. Oh, God.",It's actually a personal record for this clinic.
I'll have a huge scar! I won't be able to wear a bikini!,You wear a bikini now?
"Yeah, you got a pRoblem with that?","Nope, but I've nEver gone swimming with you."
I knew it. That's what this is all about! You are trying to force me to have cosmetic surgery!,"Yeah, that's exactly why I planted a thirty pound tumor on your ovary."
That was unexpected.,"nodding Yeah, it was."
I can't beliEve she was that desperate.,"Yeah, I'm sure that if Everyone I knew hated me, I couldn't bear to look at me. I wouldn't go so far as to shoplift."
Right. He gets up and starts to walk off.,stuttering Wait!
Could be something related to the pills. Or not.,"Or both. Diet pills brought her to us, we gave her the sores."
You think she got a staph infection from something here?,"I'm not saying the hospital gave the sores, I'm saying we did. By treating her. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis."
Highly unlikely. We started her on heparin before the warfarin.,Who gave her the heparin?
"I gave warfarin, she gave heparin.",Sure you didn't both give her warfarin?
"Yes, I did not screw up.",to Chase Did you actually see her prepare and administer the heparin? pregnant pause Enough said.
"Yeah, right. There's gotta be some other cause.",None that I can think of.
Vogler wants to know what he can do for me.,shouting out the door Hey! Stop worrying about your asses and start worrying about the Patient's.
Wanted to know what warfarin is. I don't know.,Brrrr. Icy. Definitely think twice before correcting one of your mistakes again.
"still at her microscope Correct all you want. Of course, it's a bit more productive if there's an actual mistake.","Right, I always forget that part."
"I gave her the heparin, which means the necrosis is not a reaction to the warfarin, which is pRobably why she's not responding to your treatment.","Yet. pause If you didn't screw up, then what is it? You don't have an answer."
You don't have an answer. Yet.,"When you come up with something, let me know. I'll be in the clinic, warming up."
turning to look at him I'm the only one who's always stood behind you when you've screwed up.,Why? Why would you support someone who screws up?
"Because I'm not insanely insecure. And because I can actually trust in another huMan being and I am not an angry, misanthropic son of a bitch.","I'm sorry, you said you weren't angry. Who would you fire?"
Who would you fire? No one.,Not an option.
If Everyone took a pay cut and put in a few more hours we could all stay for the same amount of money.,"Figures you'd try and come up with a solution where no one gets hurt. The pRoblem is, the world doesn't work that way just 'cause you want it to."
"getting up Excuse me, Dr. House? My wife saw you yesterday, Lucille Hernandez?","Uh, he's not in today."
My wife said he walked with a cane.,He's also got a bit of a drug pRoblem. Sometimes doesn't show up for weeks. He walks into Cuddy's office.
He's not gonna fire anybody.,Yes.
"If he can work it so we can keep the current staff for the same amount of money, what difference does it make?",It's not about the money.
What's going on with my wife?,"Even if I was Dr. House, physician-Patient confidentiality protects me from annoying conversations."
But she told me about the tumor.,Yeah? She also tell you why she's refusing to have it removed?
I don't care about a scar. And she can always gain the weight back.,You want her to regain the weight?
"Yeah. I mean, only if she wants to.",Why?
I've always thought she's looked sexiest when she was pregnant. House looks slightly disturbed. Something 'bout knowing she's a mother makes me want to,"Yeah, tell her that and leave me alone."
"I did. You gotta talk to her, I couldn't bear it if something happened to her","The tumor is benign, nothing's gonna happen. Except maybe some more heartburn."
What if it gets Even bigger? Or if it changes?,You know where to find us. Building's not going anywhere.
Tell her it's cancer. House pushes the elevator button. You obviously don't have a pRoblem with lying.,"Oh, way to win me over."
takes out wallet of pictures We have six kids. She can't afford to take a chance.,"You have kids! How novel! That changes Everything. So if Mommy has heartburn, one of them might catch on fire."
"Please, I don't know what we'd do. House takes the pictures.",They are cute. Have her come back in.
Have her come back in. What?,Your plight has moved me. Elevator dings. Tell your wife to come back.
Maybe because we're treating her for the wrong thing.,Have you found the right thing?
Have you found the right thing? No.,Then we continue the treatment. Hope it's just taking longer than it should.
At this point it doesn't matter what caused the necrosis.,Or who.
Get rid of it. Remove the dying flesh before it penetrates the abdominal wall.,Do it.
Can we talk?,"What, no roses, no chocolates? If you're here to apologize"
I'm not here to apologize.,"Uh-oh, that means you're here for something more compliCated. He takes Vicodin."
Do you want to fire me?,Yes. I was just waiting for an excuse. Thank God Vogler came along. Phew!
It's the only reason I can think of that you're insisting that I made a mistake.,"Really? Because there is another explanation. He stands up. Perhaps not as much fun as your Freudian analysis, but maybe you actually made a mistake."
You're doing this because you can't deal with your feelings for me.,I beliEve that you are the only one to express feelings.
"You're the one being different! You're always pushing things, pushing the rules, pushing us, but not this time. You just jumped on this idea like a life raft. Not one question about what else it could be, no riding us for other answers.",I have the answer.
"Then why aren't you watParkng TV? Or playing your damn Game Boy, or whatEver else you have fun doing by yourself? Maybe I should just quit. Make it easy for Everyone.","Maybe you should. Cameron leaves, making the door shake behind her."
"Maybe you should. Cameron leaves, making the door shake behind her.",Men are pigs.
You call me in to tell me,"I should have realized the vasectomy and condoms was overkill, but this was too obvious."
Where'd you get that?,"From the father of three, maximum four of your six Parkldren."
You? You're sick.,So are you. I'm sure there are websites full of men looking for married women with surgical scars. He hands her back the pictures. So have the surgery. Please?
Foreman Ever said anything about talking to me? Interesting.,"It's been almost three hours, still no change in her condition."
So what do you want to do?,Assume that Cameron didn't screw up. What if it's not the warfarin?
It has to be. The sores presented right after we,"Right, right, right, but let's just say it's not. Come on, come on, what have you got?"
Can I have a second to think?,"No, there's no time to think! Say the first thing that comes to you head."
That's not what I meant.,We already considered obesity as a cause.
"No, what if it's not a cause? What if it's a symptom?","Okay, so what could cause obesity and skin necrosis? Listen, I don't care if it makes sense, just give me something."
Ulcers secondary to vaculitis.,"No, that's just sores, not obesity."
"No, that's just sores, not obesity. Pyoderma gangrenosum?","More sores. Okay, let's look at it from the other side. What has obesity as a symptom?"
"Genetics are more likely. Her mom's heavy, too.",She's not just heavy. She's tall. We have any history on the dad?
We have any history on the dad? Yeah. 6'1.,"Kid's short. We've got stunted growth, high blood pressure, blood clots, obesity it's Cushing's."
"No, necrosis doesn't present in","In rare cases Cushing's can cause hypercalcemia, which can lead to the same skin necrosis as warfarin. It's perfect. It explains Everyting."
Except it's not Cushing's. She's had multiple blood tests and none show abnormal cortisol lEvels.,"The hypercortisolism could be cyclical, we just didn't catch it in the right phase."
We'll have to do another UFC.,There's no time! We've got less than an hour to make the call.
"If we assume it's not Cushing's, she'll lose her breasts and may still be sick.",Do an MRI.
You want us to look for hypercortisolism with an MRI?,"No, I want you to look for what could cause hypercortisolism with an MRI."
It's been a week.,"Actually, it's over a week. Where have you guys been?"
Who is it?,Chase.
"No, Chase stays. Pick someone else.",The deal was
Deal's changed. Pick someone else.,No.
"The Senator's suffering from nausea, headache, and mental confusion.","Yeah, bad sushi is so hard to diagnose."
"You're being Parkldish. Look, if his case is as trivial as you think it'll take you three minutes to diagnose him.","Uh huh, three minutes that I could spend sitting on the toilet with the funny pages."
You're mad at me.,closes the door Nope. I nEver liked Cameron or Foreman.
"Do you know why I'm forcing you to fire one of them? Because you need to prove to me that you're a team player. Now, if you did that, you wouldn't need to go through this exercise.",Fine. I'll hold the Senator's hair while he upchucks.
"as House is leaving Oh, and by the way, I need you to give a speech at the National Cardiology Conference. Next week.",I don't do speeches. I'm shy.
Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals has dEveloped a new ACE inhibitor. I would like you to extol the virtues of this breakthrough medication.,"Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals! wait a second, don't I own that company? Oh, no, that's right, you do."
Viopril is a significant improvement over the old version. All there in the study. He hands House a booklet of information.,I know its price tag is significantly improved.
sighs You can either give one ten minute talk and one three minute diagnosis or you can fire one of your pets. My understanding was that you beliEved in rationality above all else. House grabs the Viopril information along with the Senator's chart.,mutters as he leaves Viopril!
"I don't think so. And I don't think that's it, I've been under the weather for weeks, you know. Lots of traveling, supposed to be in the Sudan next week. Beeps are heard from the corner, namely, from House's gameboy.","Helps me concentrate. Puts down Nintendo, picks up Vicodin. Even better than drugs. He pops one to demonstrate."
"When I was six, I fell off the swings and bit my tongue. Couldn't talk right for the longest time. Lots of teasing. But, you know, it just made me fight harder, speak up for those who can't.","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tongues heal too fast. Your political consultants have written you a nice story. In a tight race the lispers alone could put you over the top."
"You a Republican, or you just hate all politicians?",I just find being forced to sit through drivel annoying.
You find sincerity annoying.,You're a black kid from the ghetto who made it to Yale Law and the United States Senate.
"What's wrong? House tests the reflexes himself, no change. What is it?",It's not the food. It's your brain. to Foreman Get an MRI and a lumbar puncture. to Wright Cancel your travel plans.
The LP showed no sign of infection and the MRI was fairly clean.,I guess we can tell him he's fairly healthy and can go home.
Most likely just background nose.,Care to bet your job on that? Chase makes a face. What was that?
What was what?,You got annoyed. That was clearly an annoyed face.
I get annoyed by glib remarks about our futures.,"But last week you didn't get annoyed, you made poopie in your pants. It's weird, it's almost like now you know you have nothing to worry about."
Chase has nothing to worry about?,None of you has anything to worry about.
None of you has anything to worry about. What happened?,Vogler saw the error of his ways and repented.
You wanna cut into his brain.,"Dangerous, I know."
"Dangerous, I know. Especially as he's a politician, his brain's all twisted. But I weighed that against the risk of him stroking out before lunch. Call surgery, get it scheduled. He leaves.",You're not pregnant. He hands her some tissues.
"Well, I told you that. But there's gotta be some other reason I'm still spotting.","Sure. You were pregnant. Based on your hormone lEvels, you had a miscarriage."
I haven't Even been on a date.,"charting Right, since it's physically impossible to have sex without someone buying you dinner."
I haven't had sex since I split up with my husband. That was almost a year ago.,"Fine, have it your way. Immaculate conception."
"Um, what do I do?","Well, it's obvious. Start a religion. He leaves. As he walks out, Cuddy storms past him."
In my office.,"to the clinic nurse, conspiratorially Afternoon delight. She just loves the hard wood. House enters Cuddy's office."
You're not doing a brain biopsy on a spot on a MRI.,Where'd you get that?
Not on an United States Senator.,"Oh, just so I'm clear, if he was a janitor, that would be okay. Do you have a list?"
A brain biopsy can cause perManent neurological damage.,"Uh huh, whereas tumors are really good for brains, make 'em grow big and strong. It's my call."
"No, it's not.",You're pulling rank on Patient care?
It's up to you.,"Either it's a tumor or it's an infection that the lumbar puncture didn't pick up. Either way, if we don't treat it immediately, it could kill you."
W-what caused my s-symptoms?,"Wow, excellent question. Many doctors wouldn't have gone there."
It could be a transient ischemic attack. You could make the argument for watParkng carefully for the time being.,"Mmm, but you'd only make that argument if you were an administrator covering your own ass."
"That's absurd, and insulting.","Insulting, yes."
W-what will the voters think? If they find out I've had a b-brain biopsy?,"This could leave you b-b-b-b-brain damaged, and you're worried about NASCAR dads?"
It's not a brain tumor.,"It's not a bacterial infection, either."
So you biopsied his brain for nothing.,"If that were true, would Dr. Wilson's mouth be contorted into that ugly little shape?"
It's toxoplasmosis. You sure?,Which means the Great Black Hope has full-blown AIDS. They're gonna love that in Dubuque.
"Theoretically, certain cancers","If you have toxo in your brain, you have AIDS."
"forcefully and painfully I do not have AIDS. I don't sh-sh-shoot up drugs, I don't sl-sleep with!",This is very bad news.
quietly We will.,"But the toxo drugs are going to piss off your fungi, and when fungi get pissed Senator Wright throws the pills."
I am not gonna take the pills.,"You're afraid word will leak out. Trust me, you're not going to become President either way. They don't call it the White House because of the paint job."
House nEver gives speeches. House enters.,"But when I really beliEve in something! Gosh dang it, I've got a chance to make a difference here."
You made a deal with Vogler?,"It's all the rage. Everybody's doing it. Chase gives House a petty, pouty look and goes to sulk in a chair. Cameron walks over to House."
"So, what's the deal? You get to keep all of us if you plug his products?","One speech, no biggie. Foreman's doing a bone marrow biopsy to check for cancer."
Cancer? The Senator's got AIDS.,Cancer sounds better on a press release. I need you guys to rush the ELisatest for HIV. He starts to walk into his office.
Thank you. For the speech.,"When I said rush, I meant, you know, fast. Stat's the word you doctors use, right?"
I know it's hard for you,"Double stat? Chase pats Cameron on the arm to follow him out, which she does."
Dr. House. I just wanted to,"You're welcome, again."
I want you to know how much I,Got it. You're grateful. Apparently you seem to think it'll mean a lot to me to know that.
Do you know why people beliEve in God?,I thought you didn't beliEve in God.
I thought you didn't beliEve in God. I don't.,"Well, then you better be making a very good point."
Do you think they pray to Him and praise Him because they want Him to know how great He is? God already knows that.,"Are you comparing me to God? I mean, that's great, but just so you know, I've nEver made a tree."
smiling I thank you because it means something to me. To be grateful for what I receive.,You are the most nave atheist I've Ever met.
"Dr. House, you have a Patient in Room One.","Thank God. He walks off, but turns around. People pray so that God won't crush them like bugs. I'm not gonna crush you."
PeteParkal bruising? I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right.,"Gosh, the internet is such a wonderful tool."
It could be leukemia.,Definitely possible. The more likely diagnosis is hickey.
"Well, it can't be a hickey.",exasperated Why is Everybody so ashamed of sex all of a sudden?
I'm not having sex. I've barely Even thought about sex since my marriage. House pulls a hair from Sarah's head. Ow!,"I say you're having sex, you say you're not. Either you're lying, or I'm wrong. Or there's some middle ground."
You mean like oral?,"I mean you're having sex without knowing it. I'm testing you for booze, drugs and GHB."
"I don't drink, and! what's GHB?",The date rape drug. He leaves.
The date rape drug. He leaves.,It's positive.
"I've only had two girlfriends. Two, after my wife died. I used c-c-condoms.",You know the chances of you getting HIV from heterosexual sex with a condom?
You know the chances of you getting HIV from heterosexual sex with a condom? Yes.,Some day there will be a black president.
"It must be miserable, always assuming the worst in people.","Oh, cut the crap, you're dying."
"You're clEver, you're witty, and you are a coward! You're scared of taking chances.","I take chances all the time, it's one of my worst qualities."
"I take chances all the time, it's one of my worst qualities. On people?",Wanting to beliEve the best about people doesn't make it true.
Being afraid to beliEve it doesn't make it false.,"Well, that's very moving. It's a shame I don't vote."
"This is who I am. I beliEve in people. I'm not hiply cynical and I don't make easy, snide remarks. I would rather think that people are good and be disappointed once and again. House gets up and grabs a syringe and some rubber gloves from a cabinet.",I need to draw some more blood.
The antiretrovirals aren't working.,That's not surprising.
"He's just going to keep getting worse. You realize that, right?",Why are you spying on my case?
Why are you giving that speech next week? House pushes the elevator button. We're both just doing what we have to do.,And you don't see a pRoblem with that?
"Checking in on a Patient? Yeah, wow, how do I look myself in the mirror?",You're not the one being asked to perpetrate a fraud on the American people.
It's a ten minute speech!,That I've been ordered to give.
Vogler's drug works!,Don't care.
"Oh, why do you have to make Everything so dramatic? Elevator dings.","Because I'm a very high-strung little lapdog. as he enters the elevator Ruff ruff ruff, rarr, ruff! Cuddy looks faintly disgusted."
"Because I'm a very high-strung little lapdog. as he enters the elevator Ruff ruff ruff, rarr, ruff! Cuddy looks faintly disgusted.",standing in the back of the room Nuh uh. No pills.
What's going on?!?,The antiretrovirals aren't working.
The antiretrovirals aren't working. Why not?,Because you don't have AIDS. The Senator laughs. The first test was a false positive. Happens one time in Every five thousand.
You r-ran a second test.,Yeah. You're still dying. The only difference is now we don't know why.
Why are we doing this here?,"So Cuddy can't find us. Unless we find out the underlying disease, this guy's lied to his last constituent."
looking at the chart False negative on the PCR AIDS test?,Ran it twice.
Ran it twice. Immunoglobulin deficiency?,No history of respiratory pRoblems.
Idiopathic T-cell deficiency.,"Idiopathic, from the Latin meaning we're idiots 'cause we can't figure out what's causing it. He takes a Vicodin. Give him a whole body scan."
You hate whole body scans.,'Cause they're useless.
Why did you order the second AIDS test?,Standard procedure.
"Oh, well, that's you. Mr. Standard Procedure. You suspected the first test was a false positive?",I knew he was going to Africa and I figured he was vaccinated for Hep A and B. That could cause a false positive.
"Yeah, but you knew that before you ordered the first test. What changed?",I should have ordered both.
"You were sure he had AIDS, then you talked to him, then you had doubts. What, what did he say?",He said he had not engaged in any risky behavior.
Huh. And you beliEved him.,"Well, he didn't have any reason to lie"
"Everybody lies, except politicians? House, I do beliEve you're a roMantic. You didn't just beliEve him, you beliEved in him. Do you want to come over tonight and watch old movies and cry? House gives a great-looking smirk. Dr. Cameron's getting to you. Well, I guess you can't be around that much niceness and not get any on you.",Is that why you haven't put the moves on her?
"What makes you think I haven't put the moves on her? House stops and stares, then realizes he fell for Wilson's trap. Oh. Oh, boy! You're in trouble. Wilson laughs and walks off. House walks into Exam Room One, where Sarah awaits.",You have restored my faith in the huMan race. You're lying.
"No, I'm not lying.","I just got your results back. No GHB, no nothing. It means you're having sex, and you're lying about it."
"No, and I have a new symptom. I have a rash on my butt. She smiles triumphantly. Do you want to! House nods, resigned. Sarah lowers her pants so House can see. What is it?",It's a carpet burn.
"No, I just wake up really exhausted.",Is something upsetting you?
"No. House gives her a look. My ex lives in the apartment downstairs. He's always calling me, always wanting to get back together, complaining about mixed signals. Get out of my life, how much clearer can you get?","We have a sleep lab in the basement. If nothing else, it'll get you away from your ex for a night."
Slightly enlarged lymph node in his left armpit.,How slightly?
Cuddy enters. Lymphoma?,"Sure, or he's had a cold in the last six months. to Chase What, you've got her on speed dial?"
Looks complex. Central necrosis?,"Spontaneous bleeding, it's benign. I was rooting for a really cool tumor, instead we're stuck with this crap."
"Doesn't matter. Once you find 'em, you've gotta check 'em.","Well, knock yourselves out. Vogler enters."
"I just saw Senator Wright, he looks like hell. That sushi must have been a lot worse than you thought.","Mr. Vogler, would you like a free whole body scan? A Man of your stature should get himself checked at least three times a year."
Here's a few key points I want you to cover during your speech.,Fourteen pages. The audience will be comatose by paragraph two.
Throw in a joke. Vogler leaves.,Dr. Chase. We need to talk.
Dr. Chase. We need to talk.,How do you see this ending?
How do you see this ending? What ending?,"I can't fire you, so you have no reason to fear me, and therefore no reason to lie to me."
pause Yeah.,So how can I work with you?
I hope so.,I am selling my soul.
Just a little piece. And you are getting something in return.,"I said I was selling it. I didn't say I was giving it away. That would be immoral, and stupid. All they've done is added antacid."
Does it work?,That's not the point!
"Well, of course it's the point! He's not asking you to lie, he's not asking you to do something illegal",He's not asking me to do anything.
"Kidney and liver cysts are both benign, and lymph nodes all came back clean.",His left armpit node has antibodies for CB 11.
"Well, not enough to indiCate lymphoma.",We nEver tested for hairy-cell leukemia.
And his spleen isn't enlarged.,Size isn't Everything. The spleen is the mother lode for hairy-cells. Let's cut it open.
"In the Senator's condition, a spleen biopsy could easily cause sepsis and kill him!","Why do you do this to me? Now, if I kill him, I can't tell the Judge I had no idea of the risks involved."
"His brain's turning into mush, and he's at risk for more infections, so we have to do it.","See, that'll sound much better in court."
Yeah. What's up?,You like me. Why?
That's kind of a sad question.,Just trying to figure out what makes you tick. I am not warm and fuzzy and you are basically a stuffed animal made by grandma.
I don't think that's why you're asking. I think it's because of the speech.,"muttering Oh God, don't try and pick me apart."
"No, his bone marrow's indeterminate, spleen's the only way to go.","standing by the window. You know, when the Inuit go fishing, they don't look for fish. Every looks at House for a bit, but he remains silent."
"sighing Why, Dr. House?","They look for the blue heron, because there's no way to see the fish."
HTLV and ATLV.,We can test for them. Run the titers.
We can test for them. Run the titers.,These were your brain waves at 245 AM.
That would explain why I'm so tired when I wake up.,"Yes, and also why you were pregnant. And the hickies. And the carpet burn."
I had sex in my sleep?,Sexsomnia is a documented disorder. You said your ex lives downstairs
I'll kill him.,"Okay, but he pRobably didn't know that you were asleep."
"He's my ex, I","You live in the same building, you haven't had sex with anyone else for a year, you sleepwalk right into his arms. Call me crazy, but I'm sensing unresolved issues."
Negative for HTLV-1 and 2 and ATLV and Everything else. It's not hairy-cell. He stops House. Hey. You really gonna give that speech?,"You've got an opinion, too?"
"I'm a little surprised. Frankly, I thought you were too much of a self-absorbed ass to do this for us.",You're welcome. He's positive for Epstein-Barr.
House pushes the chart at Foreman and walks off very quickly. Hey!,You didn't fall off the swings when you were eight.
You didn't fall off the swings when you were eight. Six!,Ever.
Give that back!,Uh uh. We have to talk. You had an epileptic seizure. That's how you bit your tongue.
I haven't had a seizure since I was,What medication did you take?
No seizure since I was six. No drugs since I was ten!,"Yeah, that's it. Don't worry about what the question is, don't worry that you're starting to feel dizzy, just stay on message."
frantic now My mother used to call it physofin,Phenytoin?
"Yeah! House places the breathing mask back on the Senator's face. Okay, okay, you're okay, it's okay. Everybody lies.",Senator Gary H.
CVID? That's a type of immunoglobulin deficiency. I said that.,"Yeah, well, it was a stupid idea when you said it. Then he got the respiratory pRoblem and tested positive for Epstein-Barr."
That's pretty much a Parkldhood disease.,Another reason why Chase's suggestion was idiotic.
So you're basing your diagnosis on a disease that's relatively common and a drug he took thirty years ago.,"Start the senator on IV immunoglobulin stat. If he gets better, I'm right, if he dies, you're right."
"If he gets better, I'm right, if he dies, you're right. Dr. House!",You faked that.
You faked that. No.,Say antiretroviral.
Say antiretroviral. Antiretroviral.,Now say it three times fast.
Am I well enough to run for president?,"Well, why not run for pope while you're at it?"
"Oh, come on. Kennedy had Addison's, FDR had polio. Two of the best presidents in the last hundred years",If they were running today they wouldn't stand a chance.
"So, you figure you'd be Surgeon General if you didn't have the limp.","No, there's things I can't do, and like you said, I have to live with reality."
"No, don't get excited, he's right, I, uh, I won't win.",Then why run?
"But hey, why listen to me? I own the company, I'm certainly not to be trusted, right? Dr. Gregg House, on the other hand, has a reputation. For integrity, among other things. Crowd chuckles. Quick shot of Wilson, Cuddy, Chase and Cameron sitting at a table in the audience. Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Gregg House. House stands up and walks to the podium to applause. The PPTH table looks slightly apprehensive, as if their jobs were riding on what is to happen next. Well, I guess when you think about it! We see Foreman for the first time, leaning against a doorway. House adjusts the microphone, and!","reading off a paper, very monotone Eastbrook Pharmaceuticals' extraordinary commitment to research excellence is exemplified by their new ACE inhibitor, a breakthrough medical approach that will protect millions from heart disease."
"quietly, yet deadly That's not a speech.","I thought it was pithy. You got enough for a press release, anyhow."
Foreman or Cameron? House gives a little smile and goes back to the podium.,A few things I forgot to mention.
"A few things I forgot to mention. Ed Vogler is a brilliant businessMan. A brilliant Judge of people, and a Man who has nEver lost a fight. You know how I know the new ACE inhibitor is good? Because the old one was good. The new one is really the same, it's just more expensive. Vogler does not look happy. A lot more expensive. See, that's another example of Ed's brilliance. At this point, Wilson looks mildly interested, Cuddy looks mad, and Chase and Cameron look like the world's about to end. WhenEver one of his drugs is about to lose its patent he has his boys and girls alter it just a tiny bit and patent it all over again. Making not just a pointless new pill, but millions and millions of dollars. Which is good for Everbody, right? Cuddy is now shaking her head in disbelief, and Wilson is staring pointedly. The Patients, pish. Who cares, they're just so damn sick! God obviously nEver liked them anyway. Cuddy furious Wilson facepalm. Chase downs his whole glass of wine, and Cameron is staring at the table's centerpiece. All the healthy people in the room, let's have a big round of applause for Ed Vogler! House claps, Foreman shakes his head, the rest of the room stays silent. Vogler, well, he doesn't look happy at all. As House hands Vogler the paper -- I threw in a joke.",I'm sorry. I should have taken a couple of extra Vicodin and just held my nose.
I'm guessing you did take a couple extra Vicodin.,True.
You don't need to worry about firing anyone. I'm leaving.,"Why? Is this another noble, self-sacrificing gesture? You trying to protect Foreman?"
You trying to protect Foreman? No.,"So this is just, Don't fire me, I quit."
Heh. Look for a shallow grave with Vogler standing over it.,You have a Stage 4 cancer.
"Thank you, Doctor. You've been so good to me.","Well, I did publicly bash your company's drug."
When I think about how I treated you!,"Oh, hey, come on. House gets up and walks to behind Vogler, sans cane and limp. He rests his hands on Vogler's shoulders. There, there, there. Vogler sniffles."
"So, um, there is some hope?","Always. But just in case, I special-order an extra jumbo-size coffin."
"But just in case, I special-order an extra jumbo-size coffin. Hey!",Don't thank me. It's just who I am.
"Up and at 'em, big guy. House blinks and rubs his eyes.","Sorry, up late. Internet porn."
How come you're not in your office?,"Because there is a computer in my office. If I log on, roMance will ensue. My wrist might fall off."
Hiding because Vogler's looking for you. That's just pathetic.,"I don't like loud, angry giants threatening me with violence. How is that pathetic?"
You think you can avoid firing one of us by hiding out here? He'll find you sooner or later.,getting a drink I'm okay with later.
"holds out chart 39-year-old female, 28 weeks pregnant, G 4, P 0.",Three miscarriages? Gimme. takes the file
Altered mental status and complete loss of coordination.,Tox screen?
Negative for alcohol and drugs. She was on oxybutynin.,For incontinence.
The three miscarriages make me think it's an underlying physiology.,"Pregnancy-related autoimmunity. Too bad that Cameron quit, I could use an immunologist right now. We'll see if you're right check the blood."
We'll see if you're right check the blood. Cameron quit?,"Last night. And do an MRA for vasculitis, too."
There is no way she quit! She got fired because you couldn't swallow your pride!,"An ultrasound? Excellent thought! And put her on magnesium, too, in case it is preeclampsia. He takes a Vicodin."
"She gets sick a lot but this, this cold got really bad all of a sudden. And the fEver! to the baby Shhhh, it's okay.",It's not a cold. hands the baby back to Rachel It's pneumonia.
hands the baby back to Rachel It's pneumonia. Pneumonia?,"Relax, pneumonia's her second-biggest pRoblem."
"But it's healthy, raw food. We're vegans. Almond milk, tofu, vegetables!",Raw food.
Is she gonna be all right?,"Antibiotics for the pneumonia, IV feeding to get the weight up. Don't worry, it's a vegan IV."
Okay. They inject her with the medication.,Whoa!
"In the morning, I expect you in my office with your letter of resignation and plans for a public apology, otherwise I'll destroy you. House looks a little shocked as Vogler walks off.",So that's a 'no' on us being squared away.
"to House, who is rummaging through the cabinets Great to see you back in the office. I guess Vogler found you?","Yeah, we had a nice little chat. I really should have kept Cameron. She knew where to find the sugar."
"It's what I said. Preeclampsia. A little stress from the MRA, she pops straight into labor.",Ah ha! He shakes a packet of sugar triumphantly.
"She choked, she couldn't Even swallow.",What did she choke on?
Her food. The muscle weakness isn't a symptom of preeclampsia.,What kind of food?
"A little bit of cooked pear, it doesn't matter! It shows weakness.","She choked on soft, wet pear. Did she forget to take the bones out? That's way past muscle weakness. Did you do an upper endoscopy?"
We've gotta talk.,Oooh. We've gotta talk. as he leaves And check her eyelids.
"Special board meeting today, only one item on the agenda you.","Well, enjoy the bagels. I'm untouchable."
I'm untouchable. Huh. Right.,Any vote to revoke my tenure has to be unanimous. I've got you and maybe Even Cuddy.
"Oh, well that settles it. Mr. Ruthless Corporate Raider will be stymied, go home, curl up on the floor of his shower and weep.",What can he do? I've got a contract.
Does it say how much your team gets paid? Where your Parking space is? If your car should be filled with horse Manure? Vogler's smart he's got some plan to get you.,"Does it involve candy? Because I'm a sucker for chocolates. Wilson gives him a look and walks away, House takes a Vicodin or two."
"Does it involve candy? Because I'm a sucker for chocolates. Wilson gives him a look and walks away, House takes a Vicodin or two.",She's doing better.
"Oh, thank God.","Technically, Alexander Fleming. He dEveloped antibiotics. Pneumonia's under control, and from now on, what say you stick with huMan food."
"Absolutely, swear to God.","This time, that's your guy. House stars to leave, but is blocked by a bunch of people entering the room, including police Officers."
"Starving your kid. I'm from Social Services, we're taking responsibility for your baby. They all leave, leaving House standing there.",This is how Vogler's gonna destroy me?
"What did he do, grease your cane?",He had my Patients arrested.
"He didn't, I did. The nurses were concerned and they called me. There was evidence of abuse you took a big legal risk by not calling Social Services.","Those parents were not abusive, they're idiots."
"Oh, well that's certainly a relief.",It was my call.
You made the wrong one.,"You know, there's a new biography of Quisling, I think you might like it."
Sure. No idea who that is.,"Uh, Norwegian guy, World War II, traitor. The fact that I have to explain this kind of takes the edge off my flow."
I was protecting you.,From what? Cops aren't gonna bust me. Disiplinary committee maybe gives me a slap on the wrist.
And Vogler has an excuse to get rid of you.,"If I don't give him one, he makes one up."
Maybe it's a granuloma.,No. There's no calcification.
Naomi is refusing to have the C-section. Her odds aren't good enough.,They do suck. Where's Wilson?
She's saving her Parkld. Cameron would point out that people are capable of sacrifice.,Cameron isn't here.
Perhaps proving her point.,You think this Woman is making a rational decision?
I think people can overcome their baser drives.,"Pretty damn rarely. And not this time, this is purely biological. In evolutionary terms, the needs of the next generation are more important."
You're saying she's making the right call?,"Darwin is, I'm not. The next generation is not my Patient. We have to raise the odds for Mommy. And where the hell is Wilson? He's the oncologist. He leaves."
to Joel There he is. Dr. House!,You guys bust out?
We made bail. They won't let us in our baby's room.,Weird. You'd think they'd let you take her home while they figured out if you tried to kill her.

"Trauma? From what, the Parkropractic treatments? It's bacterial endocarditis, an infected valve. We should do blood cultures.",Except the six months that he had with these charlatans might have been spent going to someone who looks at things that exist in the real world.
"No, not necessarily.",Hmm.
The guy obviously broke his jaw somehow. Who knows what other trauma he's suffered? We should do the angiogram again.,"And all signs point to! He looks at the 8-ball. Sorry, Chase. The gods have spoken. Start Harvey on blood thinners and antibiotics."
That's just sick.,"Well, that's an intriguing legal opinion. Geez, what kind of a Lawyer is he?"
"I was careful. I watched the monitors, made sure his O2 stats were over 90. I would nEver hurt him.",Then what was the point?
"We're not done here, we have to talk!","Call the cops, bar her from the hospital, force her to pierce your nipples! not really medical decisions."
It was a weird scene. I observed House enters.,Chase. Did you know about this Woman? What she does?
"I met her at some parties, yeah.",I wouldn't have tortured you if I knew you liked it.
I said I thought it was a trauma induced aneurysm.,"Yeah, could have carried a tad more weight if you'd mentioned the liking pain thing. You're on my naughty list. Sorry, no leather stethoscope this Christmas."
I'm not into,I assume you nEver started him on antibiotics or blood thinners before Mistress Ilsa's rude interruption.
It was pRobably a good thing.,Start him on antibiotics and blood thinners. House watches as an older gentleMan walks into his office. He watches the Man throughout the rest of this scene.
You still think Chase is wrong?,"No, he's pRobably right."
"If we put him on blood thinners, he might bleed out.","But if Foreman's right about it being bacterial endocarditis, and we Foreman raises his hand."
I think Chase is right.,"Okay, if Foreman used to be right about it being blood clots, and we take the surgery route, then we'll pRobably kill the guy."
You Dr. House?,"I have a feeling I'm going to regret this, but yes."
"Ramona said I should come to you for my refill. He holds up a pill bottle. Uh, with, for the beginning to droop? He demonstrates with his finger. House takes the bottle. She said you'd pRobably want to talk to me first.",She lied. He hands Myron a script. Here you go.
Here you go. Thanks.,Always happy to make people happy. Goodbye.
I I don't know how much more of this I can take.,How much more of what?
How much more of what? whispers Sex.,You don't want more sex?
My golf swing is all messed up.,"Hey, here's a radical thought. Talk to her."
Talk to her. The truth?,Sounds crazy when you put it like that.
"Oh, Ramona's got a big appetite. If I don't perform, I don't want to lose her. He sighs. You got a pharmacy around here?",In the hospital? Could be. Let's see if we can find it.
In the hospital? Could be. Let's see if we can find it.,Got any blue pills?
raising his eyebrows You looking for ED medication?,"Well, that's one example of a blue pill. Name six others."
There's a brand of acetaminophen out!,Perfect. Fill her up. House nods to Myron. Cuddy walks up.
Cuddy walks up. Dr. House.,Little busy here.
I heard about Dr. Cameron's conditions for coming back to work.,It's purely business. I'll make sure you get the recipt.
"Well, I think it's a good thing. What happened in your last relationship, it's no reason to wall yourself from people forEver. 5 years of self-pity is pRobably enough.","Wow. Well, you've certainly given me a lot to think about. If only I was as open as you."
If only I was as open as you. Well,"Actually, it was your blouse I was talking about. Cuddy smiles."
Weakness in his right arm and hand. Harvey's having mini-strokes the blood thinners aren't making a difference.,"Stop the treatment. to Foreman Sorry, we tried your way, you could not have been wronger."
I said Chase was pRobably right.,"Oh yeah, we've all got perfect 20-20 hindsight."
About tomorrow night.,You couldn't keep your mouth shut.
I didn't see any reason to. Where are we going? I want to make sure I dress appropriately.,That would be army boots and t-shirt. It's the county paintball tourney. First prize is fifty bucks I'll split it with you if you hold your end up.
I'm not sure if that was the deal.,Relax. I made a reservation at Caf Spiletto. Regarding wardRobe are you too young to remember spandex?
"I already did. Mashed them up in his applesauce, it'll lighten him up soon enough.",Someone should just tell him to do it. Way faster.
And I already tried.,Not you. Where's a good dominatrix when you need one?
Annette's barred from the hospital.,"If you get caught, Cuddy's got a hairbrush. And beliEve me, she knows how to use it."
"So, what's that, two strokes you've scared this guy into?",Yeah. It's making me question my view of myself as a people person.
He said no. We can't do it.,"Emergent situation, invoke heroic measures."
You need a court order.,"Great, where do I get me one of them? Do I need to Lawyer up?"
I'll need to show the Judge an affidavit from next of kin.,"Well, they might have a pRoblem signing anything seeing as how they're dead."
He'll want proof.,"Like what, dad's hand? I don't Even know where they're buried."
"They guy lives in Market Town. I don't know if he grew there, but we could check the local funeral home.","Great, and when your searches turn up nothing you should try to find out where they live."
He said they were dead.,"Accountants, they're usually pretty good with money, so how come he lives in a slum like Market Town?"
Maybe they were bad accountants.,Two bad accountants from the Pacific Rim? The odds are astronomical.
Or maybe they cut him off when they found out about his proclivities.,"That'd be my bet. Go to his apartments. See if you can find his folks. Address, number, something. House walks into his office. Foreman follows him."
"Hey, can I talk to you?",Sure.
"Look, Cameron's a friend. This whole dating thing",turns on the TV Time's up. Thanks for playing.
"Hey, I've been on the scene more than you recently.",Way ahead of you.
"Come on, you're not into her. Most guys who aren't interested in a Woman try to sugarcoat it, be nice.","Oh, you know me too well."
That's what I'm saying. I think you should go with your instincts here. Be a jerk.,I'm missing my soap for this?
"Women love to be right. You've got to leave them feeling superior. Like they've dodged a bullet. If you're nice, she'll blame herself",And fall for me Even more.
I didn't get a chance. Call back.,I'll do it.
They're gonna show up at the morgue.,Be sure to let me know when Cuddy starts screaming. Chase takes the second mint box from his pocket and eats a few more.
He told us our son was dead.,"It's only a white lie. Technically, all I did was call them a little early. Trust me, he'll be dead real soon. Actually, I saved you some rush hour traffic."
I'm calling our Lawyer.,Fine. Just as soon as you sign this surgery consent. I have a pen. Mrs. Park takes out her cell phone and dials.
He humiliated us. Everybody we know knows about his perversion.,But you don't get off on embarrassment the way your son does. I guess it skips a generation.
How much money would it take to compensate you,"Yeah, you guys can haggle in a minute."
The wide side's too short. You're gonna look like Lou Costello.,This is a mistake.
"Open doors for her, help her with her chair",I have been on a date.
"Uh, not since disco died. Comment on her shoes, her earrings, and then move on to D.H.A. Her dreams, hopes and aspirations. Trust me. Panty-peeler. Oh, and if you need condoms, I've got some.",Did your wife give them to you?
"Drug rep. They've got antibiotics built in, somehow.",I should cancel. I've got a Patient in surgery tomorrow. House moves to the kitchen.
"And if you were a surgeon, that would actually matter. That's a good idea, settle your nerves. Get me a beer, too.",looking in the fridge No beer.
You're gonna eat before dinner? House reaches into the fridge and takes out a corsage. Wilson gets up to investigate.,"This is pretty lame, right? Wilson smiles."
putting on the corsage It's beautiful. And you look very handsome.,Thank you.
I've always loved this restaurant.,Yeah. It's changed a lot since the last time I was here. It used to be a strip joint. Cameron laughs. Nice earrings.
My mom's. Thank you.,Nice shoes. Comfortable?
I'm not expecting you to be someone you're not.,"We're in a restaurant, we're dressed up, we're eating. If not small talk, what is there? Awkward pause of doom."
"setting down the wine list According to Freud, and I'm paraphrasing, instinct of love toward an object deMands a mastery to obtain it, and if a person feels they can't control the object or feel threatened by it, they act negatively toward it. Like an eighth-grade boy punParkng a girl.","I treat you like garbage, so I must really like you. Given your Freudian theory, what does it mean if I start being nice to you?"
That you're getting in touch with your feelings.,Hmm. So there's absolutely nothing I can do to make you think that I don't like you.
"Sorry, no. I have one Evening with you, one chance, and I don't want to waste it talking about what wines you like or what movies you hate. I want to know how you feel about me.",You live under the delusion that you can fix Everything that isn't perfect.
"It was fine, how was your Evening?","She had the ravioli, I had the puttanesca."
"Yes, I really want to know about the quality of the food. Either something very good happened, or something very bad. Which is it?","Well, I did have a little indigestion afterwards. Maybe it was the garlic bread."
"It was the wine. We had a nice, candid conversation.","Nothing deep, mostly small talk."
"Nothing deep, mostly small talk. I'm sure.","Took your advice, complimented her shoes, that's fifteen minutes of chat right there."
You two going to do dinner again?,I don't think so.
"Maybe we should go back to the blood thinners, up the dosage.","If it's not clots, a loading dose of blood thinners is gonna make him bleed out of his ears."
This is important!,"Chase, Cameron, get another angiogram and echo."
"Those pills you gave Myron, they're not working.","Well, glad to see you've got the correct perspective on the thing."
"Well, the old ones, you know, made me feel like a tree!",Nice visual.
"The new ones, well, might as well be eating candy.",Candy wouldn't take away your headaches.
Candy wouldn't take away your headaches. What?,You came to me and told me that you were having too much sex.
I nEver did!,"You too, Sequoia."
"Well no, that's not true, I!","I know that Everybody lies, but you'd think that after a certain amount of time together you wouldn't be trying so hard."
"What, well, why would they?","Well, style is one thing, but one silver, one gold? How long have you guys been married?"
simultaneously 55 years.,"Damn it, you're having an affair."
I just need a little rest.,"You guys aren't the victim of the little blue pill, you're the pRoblem!"
"Me, too. I should just have told you how I felt.",Aw.
"Hey, how 'bout the pills?",Looks like you guys are good to go drug-free for a while.
Looks like you guys are good to go drug-free for a while.,"Dr. Chase, these breath mints you've been popping since yesterday. Are they a new fetish?"
"Oh, I got them at Harvey's. What, I just took two boxes the guy's got a whole drawer of them!",And you didn't find that interesting.
"Well, there's lots of interesting stuff at his place. The mints weren't high up on the list.",Wrong.
The mints weren't high up on the list. Wrong.,"Chase, get your nose in here."
"If you're trying to humiliate me, I told you","Come on, just put your face in his mouth. Chase does so, and then recoils."
"Chase does so, and then recoils. Ugh.","Rich, wouldn't you say?"
Uh. Smells like old vomit.,Number one sign of fulminating osteomylitis.
Infection of the jaw?,PRobably from the original break.
So how do we confirm?,Like this.
"Like this. He sticks a syringe in Harvey's jaw, pulling out pus from the infection. Ladies and gentlemen, we have pus. He hands the syringe to Chase, and takes the tic-tacs from him, eating a few. We're gonna remove the jaw. Anybody got a buzzsaw? Okay, call a surgeon.","Hi, I'm Dr. House. to the nurse How's tricks, Annette? The nurse turns, and it is indeed Annette in nurse's scrubs."
I just wanted to see if he was okay. I'll leave.,"No, it's okay."
He's not a freak.,"Yeah, he is. A little. But it's got to stop. Or he'll die."
"It's not about pain. It's about being open, being completely vulnerable to another person. If you can learn to be that deeply trusting! it changes you.","Well, lock him in a cage. That should be fine, medically."
Dr. Riley is throwing up he obviously can't lecture,"You witnessed the spew, or you just have his word for it?"
laughing Dr. Riley doesn't have a history of lying to me.,You said this is the fifth time he's missed a class this year! Either he's dying or he's lying.
I'll give you two hours off clinic duty.,"Fine, I'll have Cameron do it. She loves inspiring the inspired. He starts to walk off."
You'll do it.,turning back Why is it always me?
Because the world hates you. Or because it's a class on diagnostics. Pick whatEver reason feeds your narcissism better.,"I'm not doing it. He leaves, stops at the door, and walks back in. You're supposed to stop me. Renegotiate."
"Hmm, and you were supposed to keep on walking. Sorry, I guess we both screwed up. Go on, do it again.",I'll do the lecture for four hours off clinic.
"Dr. House, there's a Patient.","I'm outta here, take it up with Cuddy."
"Gregg. House turns at the clinic doors to see! the infamous Stacy, waiting with a bunch of papers and x-ray films. She walks up to him House looks! well, it's hard to describe. Run over by a bus sounds good.","Hi, Stacy."
How're you doing?,"How am I doing? Well, the last five years have been like! you Ever see those Girls Gone Wild videos?"
"Your life's been like that, or your life's been spent watParkng them? They both kind of smile. I have missed you.",Is that why you're here? Stacy shakes her head.
I need your help. She hands him the films he limps over to the clinic desk to take a look.,Who am I looking at?
Who am I looking at? My husband.,Who is suffering abdominal pain and fainting spells.
Did you think I wasn't going to get married?,"Not to someone so poorly endowed. This guy's pancreas is pathetic. He walks off, Stacy follows."
"There is no kidney stone, no indigestion. Three hospitals, five doctors, not one of them found anything.","Well, maybe there's nothing to be found."
"Right, you suddenly trust doctors, love puppies and long walks in the rain.",The walks are out. Stacy grabs his arm.
"I was around you long enough to know when something's not right. Mark's had personality changes, he's acting strange, disconnected!",Interesting. It means there's either a neurological component or he's having an affair.
"No affair, no nothing! He's sick! I know you're not too busy you avoid work like the plague. Unless it actually is the plague. I'm asking you a favor.","I'm not too busy, but I'm not sure I want him to live. It's good seeing you again. He leaves, and Stacy is holding back tears."
"I'm not too busy, but I'm not sure I want him to live. It's good seeing you again. He leaves, and Stacy is holding back tears.",Three guys walk into a clinic.
Most likely cause of leg pain is muscle strain. Apply heat and rest affected areas.,"Statistically, you're right."
What were they doing when pain presented?,I have no idea. Enter the third student the Rebellious one.
You didn't ask? You didn't take a history?,"Of course, but all that told us was what they said happened."
"Whoa, you treated the Baywatch Parkck?",The Baywatch thespian.
"The Baywatch thespian. And no, I've gotta disguise the identity of each of the Patients and I got tired of using the middle-aged Man. Carmen seemed like a pleasant alternative. Also, she's apparently quite the golfer. He stands. Now, in less than two hours, one of these three will get tossed out of the hospital because they were faking it to score narcotics, and one will be very close to death. Any guesses on which is which? Silence. Okay, I say we start with the farmer.","Did you hike to the fence, and how far?"
"Yes, it's about half a mile from my farmHouse.",And where's the pain localized?
It started just above my ankle and it's radiating up.,"So, what should we do first? He turns, and Keen Student is standing right next to him."
"He turns, and Keen Student is standing right next to him. Family history?","Indicative of leg pain? That's a very short list. Any history of bone cancer, osteogenesis imperfecta or multiple myeloma? The farmer shakes his head. Caring Student pops up."
"If the pRoblem's vascular, he's better off","Bzzt! Sorry, thanks for playing. Patient's dead. You killed him. The students look and sure enough, the farmer's dead on the table."
We had no time to run any tests there was nothing we could do!,You had time to look at the leg.
I thought we were starting with the farmer's case first.,We are. But if we're going to look at a leg!
We are. But if we're going to look at a leg!,I need you to take off your pants.
"House looks at the wound, and then looks out as he proclaims -- Puncture. Snakebite.",That would be my guess.
Farmer didn't know he had been bit by a snake?,"That's what he said. Sudden shooting pain, tall grass, nEver saw a thing."
What kind of snake?,You want me to tell you what kind of snake it was from the shape of the hole in the leg?
How are we supposed to know what kind of antivenin to use if we don't know what kind of snake it is?,"Oh, there are people to find those things out."
"The guy might only have a couple of hours. They open the gate, but close it again as a dog comes up barking at them.","And while we wait for the HuMane Society to show up, what say we check up on the volleyball player?"
"How old is this person? I mean, it's not really a 40-year-old Man on a girls' volleyball team, right?",It's a leg. A leg is a leg is a leg.
"Well, I was just worried that",Would you worry about her more if she was younger?
Obviously we should care about our Patients no matter what age,"Yeah, right. I saw the way you were looking at Carmen. She's mine, stay away. Chuckles from the class. Would you operate on your mother?"
Of course not. I'd be too nervous couldn't be objective.,Then why are you so anxious to treat Every Patient like they're family? The actual Patient is 16. Here's what happens when doctors care to much.
"I went back three generations no history of cancer, Parkinson's, or any other degenerative condition. But there's this boy at school, and he's on the boys' volleyball team, and they made out at a party, and now he won't call her back, and this friend of hers at school said this boy didn't like her and nEver did.",You got all this from an examination of the knee?
I think she's depressed.,She doesn't have tendoni
She has tendonitis.,She's depressed about having tendonitis.
She's depressed for the same reason she has tendonitis.,Not the boy.
"No, the boy's a jerk, she knows that, and yet she's depressed. I found a nodule.","Ah. PRoblems with the thyroid gland causes depressed mental state, can cause inflammation of the tendons."
"So, because she took such an extreme interest, she found out the person had a thyroid condition.","No, because she took such an interest she discovered a tiny nodule."
"No, because she took such an interest she discovered a tiny nodule. Which, in reality, signified nothing, but gave us no choice but to put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test.",Here's how a well-adjusted doctor handles a case.
Can I put my pants back on now?,I'd rather you didn't. Caring Student shows up.
Which Carmen Electra is this?,First one. The golfer. Enter Keen Student.
"Then why isn't she wearing pants? House gives him a look. Like, duh!",to Carmen You have decreased reflexes in your patellar tendon. Anyone? Rebellious Student has shown up.
Rebellious Student has shown up. Slipped disc?,Could be. How bad does it hurt?
"deadpan It hurts really, really bad.",Yeah?
It doesn't seem real. Is she the one faking?,"Oh, for God's sake."
Or it could be referred pain from his groin.,"Sir, are you getting pain anywhere else? The last part is almost drowned out."
He's curling it's not the back.,"Sir, where are you getting pain?"
"Sir, where are you getting pain? Help me!",Oooh.
"We have no history, he could be allergic.",holding up the syringe What do I do?
"Better than killing him with pain killers, then While she is speaking, the Man grabs the syringe from House and sticks it in his leg.","Apparently, he's not allergic."
We screwed up.,"No, you did exactly what his attending did."
And that was the proper way to handle the case?,Yeah.
The guy used him as a dealer!,"You're going to see a lot of drug-seeking behavior in your practice, and there's a reason it works. Meanwhile, back on the farm!"
It's not going to stay that way. The monitors start to beep. Paddles!,"What say we take five? Get some coffee, go pee. He leaves."
You didn't think she was going to get married?,She asked me the same question.
And! what? You're not gonna treat him?,There's pRobably nothing wrong with him.
"Oh, sure, that makes sense. She's just using the old sick husband routine as an excuse to get back in touch with you. You think this is easy for her? The only reason she'd be anywhere near you was if she was desperate.",So I should help her because she hates me.
It's been almost six minutes. Found him.,The volleyball player was responding to the anti-inflammatories as you'd expect in a case of tendonitis.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What about the snakebite guy? I don't really care about the volleyball player.",What if I told you the volleyball player had a sudden massive stroke?
What if I told you the volleyball player had a sudden massive stroke? Really?,"No. But that would make you interested, right? What if her T4 came back low? It's not quite as interesting, but it has the benefit of being true."
You said the thyroid biopsy was a wasted test.,"No, I didn't. I said she put a person with tendonitis through an expensive and painful test. Apparently the Patient had tendonitis and a thyroid condition."
"So, that's it?","You were right the first time. Snakebite guy's way more interesting. Gross, actually."
He faxed us the venom tests which confirmed it's a timber rattlesnake.,"looking at the tests No, it's not. Notice the volume?"
I skimmed over that and the gender and the coloring and skipped right to the name of the snake.,200mg. Our guy got bit less than four hours ago. There's no way a snake regenerates that much venom that quickly.
We're supposed to know how fast snakes make their venom?,Nope. Unless you've got a Patient bit by one. Then it might be helpful. So what do we do now?
He must have been bitten by a different snake. We go back and find it.,"Or you go online and find there's only three poisonous snakes common in New Jersey the copperhead, the timber rattler, and the coral."
So we give him the antivenin for the other one.,Is that a question?
"Well, we can't just blindly give him another antivenin. Especially after the first one almost killed him. You said only three types of poisonous snakes commonly found in New Jersey. But what if this is an uncommon one?",Very good.
We've gotta find the right snake.,"No need. Odds are, by the time you get back the autopsy results will tell you what kind of snake it was."
So we do give him the antivenin for the other one.,"Again, was that a question?"
I assume that one choice kills him and one saves him.,That's usually the way it works at the leg turning black stage.
So half of us killed him and half of us saved his life.,Yeah.
But we can't be blamed for,"I'm sure this goes against Everything you've been taught, but right and wrong do exist."
"I'm sure this goes against Everything you've been taught, but right and wrong do exist. Just because you don't know what the right answer is maybe there's Even no way you could know what the right answer is doesn't make your answer right or Even okay. It's much simpler than that. It's just plain wrong.",voiceovers We gave the guy the antivenin.
He came back?,"taking some Vicodin On average, drug addicts are stupid."
I'd call the cops.,Good for you. A lot of doctors wouldn't risk their careers on a hunch.
"It's not a hunch, I mean, I know he wants drugs.",I beliEve drug addicts get sick.
But you already know he has drugs in his system.,That's not what I'm testing for.
That's not what I'm testing for.,"We're going to put this hard, rubber tube up your urethra and into your bladder. It might be a little uncomfortable."
Shouldn't I be getting some kind of anesthetic? He groans as the nurse does her job.,We're concerned about allergic reactions today.
We're concerned about allergic reactions today.,"If the guy can handle a rod in his penis for half an hour, he's really sick."
Or he's really jonesing.,There's easier ways to get a hold of drugs.
A little. Not really!,"filling the mug Well, if you can't hear me, how do you know what I asked?"
"I promise to be very careful. She gets ready to insert the needle, and the player flinches and yells as soon as the needle touches her skin. Susan!",Not her real name!

Whoa whoa whoa. Can you please slow down? House takes a sip of water from the mug and spits it out.,slowly The adenoma is most likely. Check her PTH
slowly The adenoma is most likely. Check her PTH,"-- phosphorus, and ionized calcium, and do a technetium sestamibi. Okay, that's enough about the volleyball player. What's up with the farmer? They all look at him."
They all look at him. What farmer?,Snakebite guy.
His condition's not improving double the dosage. Already did.,"There's another antivenin, it's not as effective, but"
Already tried it.,"The first stuff, the stuff he was allergic to"
Gave it to him with high-dose steroids. Nothing's working.,to the camera What does it all mean?
to the camera What does it all mean? Wrong snake?,We tried Every other antivenin we had.
We're too late?,"Yep. He's dying. His wife's here, finally found a babysitter. Who wants to let him know? Actually, I'm kidding."
He's not dying?,"Oh, yeah, he's dying, but there's no wife and kid. Which is great. Makes the breaking the news thing way easier. Oh, yeah, one more piece of news."

The drug addict is peeing blood.,How do they teach you how to tell someone that they're dying?

"And what do you have to do to get an A in You're Dying 101? They grade you on gentleness and supportiveness? Is there a scale for measuring compassion? This buddy of mine, I gotta give him ten bucks Every time somebody says Thank you. Imagine that. This guy's so good, people thank him for telling them that they're dying. He looks at his picture. Eh, needs brown. I don't get thanked that often.",You're dying. In a few hours. There's nothing we can do except deal with the pain.
"Well, I need to go home.",You're not going home.
"Wait, wait, wait. The guy's dying and all he cares about is his dog?",Any of you guys go the dog route in your improv sessions?
Any of you guys go the dog route in your improv sessions? It's a basic truth of the huMan condition that Everybody lies. The only variable is about what. The weird thing about telling someone they're dying is it tends to focus their priorities. You find out what matters to them. What they're willing to die for. What they're willing to lie for.,"Well, you must have a neighbor who"
The neighbors don't like him.,Then the HuMane Society can take him in and
"No, they won't. Maybe my aunt","It wasn't a snakebite, was it?"
I said I don't remember being bit.,Sure you do.
"I got his head, just do it!","What would you call that? That's tea-colored, right? The guy who we thought was just after the drugs! what's the differential diagnosis for urine that's tea-colored?"
what's the differential diagnosis for urine that's tea-colored? Kidney stone.,Kidney stones would cause what?

Three days before they thought it might have been muscle death?,"No, three days before the Patient suggested it might have been muscle death."
We may need to remove the leg.,"His MRI showed that the leg pain wasn't caused by the self-injection, wasn't caused by an infection. It was an aneurysm that clotted, leading to an infarction."
We have to do the surgery. The necrotic tissue has to be removed. If there's too much,I don't care what you find.
It may become necessary in order to save your life.,I like my leg. I've had it for as long as I can remember.
"Honey, I love your leg as much as you do.",They're not cutting it off.
They're not cutting it off.,Patient made the right choice. Tell a surgeon it's okay to cut a leg off and he's going to spend the night polishing his good hacksaw.
"Right, surgeons could care less about saving limbs.","Well, of course they care about their Patients."
Amazing advances have been made. Kids with prosthetic legs are running the 100-meter dash in twelve seconds.,"Yeah, they're just not as pretty. Do a bypass, restore the circulation."
Amputation is safer.,"For you, or me?"
The blockage of blood flow,Four-day blockage.
"Yes. It caused muscle cell death. When those cells die, they release cytokines and potassium --","If you restore the blood flow instead of just lopping it all off, then all that crap gets washed back into my system."
The post-operative pain alone,"I'll get through it. I understand the risks, you're in the clear. Go schedule an OR. Cuddy leaves."
"God, you're an idiot.",I think I'm more of a jerk.
"I'm not being glib. And I'm not being cute, I don't want you to kill yourself.",I'm not gonna die.
"Oh, I feel completely reassured.",I think they gotta up that morphine.
The doctors say they can't.,The doctors recommended bed rest and antibiotics.
"They screwed up, it doesn't mean they're wrong this time.",Sure doesn't mean they're right.
Morphine will kill you.,I can handle it.
"You're in pain, you're not thinking right.",That's why I need the damn morphine!
He's not big on middle ground. Yeah.,Nurse? Nurse! I need more calcium gluconate.
You just had 5 mLs.,The QRS is getting wider. My potassium is rising.
I'll talk to your doctor.,"Well, you better make it fast, 'cause I'm about to go into cardiac arrest. You give me the dose, or I go into wide complex tachycardia."
I could get in trouble,"Listen, it's not a narcotic!"
"Clear! They shock him, and he flatlines.",The Patient was technically dead for over a minute.
standing in the back Do you think he was dead? Do you think those experiences were real?,Define real.
You choose to beliEve that?,"There's no conclusive science. My choice has no practical relevance to my life, I choose the outcome I find more comforting."
You find it more comforting to beliEve that this is it?,I find it more comforting to beliEve that this isn't simply a test.
How bad is the pain right now?,It's bad.
"It's not getting any better. If you were right, the pain would be subsiding. You'd be getting better.",It's just taking longer.
"No, it's not. We've got to let him cut the leg off.",It's my leg. It's my life.
Would you give up your leg to save my life?,Of course I would.
"Then why do you think your life is worth less than mine? If this were any other Patient, what would you tell them to do?",I would say it's their choice.
Wha not a chance! You'd browbeat them until they made the choice you knew was right. You'd shove it in their face that it's just a damn leg! You don't think you deserve to live? You don't think you deserve to be happy? Not let them cut off your leg? They're both near tears.,"I can't, I can't, I'm sorry."
The pain alone is going to kill you.,"I know, I know. I need you to talk to the doctor."
You'll be out in less than a minute.,Thank you. to Stacy Hey.
to Stacy Hey. Hey.,I'll see you when I wake up. We'll go golfing. I love you.
"I love you, too. I'm sorry.",going under You've got nothing to be sorry about. Stacy gets up and walks over to Cuddy.
He won't see it that way.,"Because of the extent of the muscle removed, utility of the Patient's leg was sEverely compromised."
The Patient's an idiot.,half-laugh They usually are. Do you have a buzzer or something. What time does this class end?
at the doorway Twenty minutes ago.,I'm not doing this again.
"I'm not doing this again. picking up the World's greatest dad mug and walking toward Cuddy And this guy is not the world's greatest dad. Not Even ranked. Who the hell lets their kids play with lead-based paint? That's why he's always sick. Find him some plastic cups and the class is all his again. He leaves, leaving behind a full room of shellshocked students.","Stacy, it's Gregg. I've got an opening for ten tomorrow morning. Make sure your husband isn't late. He hangs up, and enters his office."
"Stacy, it's Gregg. I've got an opening for ten tomorrow morning. Make sure your husband isn't late. He hangs up, and enters his office.",I gotta go.
"No, no, he'll be here. I'm sure he's just running a little late.","He's cancelled two exams, he's not gonna"
He's scared of you.,"Sure. The ex-boy-toy. Eh, that makes sense."
He wasn't scared before.,"Right, you think being afraid of me is a symptom of a serious ailment."
"Sudden mood swings, infantile regression, abdominal pain, he's passed out twice, yeah! I think it might be a medical pRoblem.",He's twenty minutes late. I'm outta here.
Please. She puts her hand on his. He'll be here.,Why? Because he loves you and does Everything he's told?
Because I didn't tell him you'd be here. She gives him a Ha! kind of look. House fixes the necklace Stacy's wearing a silver crucifix.,He likes to see.
"Hey about to make introductions, but --",Hi. I'm Gregg House. You must be Matt.
Hi. Wow. Gregg House.,Yeah. Wow.
"No, I haven't been avoiding you, I just didn't want to waste your time. The other doctors checked me out and they said it was just stress. College season, kids, parents, they're all over me.",Makes sense to me.
Makes sense to me. Gregg,What do you want me to do?
You said you'd check him out!,He says he's healthy. What's to check out?
"Sorry for the mix-up, but I'm glad you two got a chance to catch up. Looks like you're having fun.","Oh, he's good. If you can fake sincerity, you can fake pretty much anything. I can't tell you how much I like your fella."
"Yeah, me too. You know, I thought you'd be all sarcastic, bitter, you know, because Stacy married me. He puts an arm around Stacy to emphasize the fact.","You know, we should do things together. Maybe throw a ball around or something. Guy stuff."
We could go for a run together.,Hah! He's Oscar Wilde!
"Wow, this pissing contest is really turning me on. He needs to go to the hospital.","raising his glass Here's to women. You can't live with 'em, you can't kill 'em until the neighbors are stripping in Atlantic City."
raising his own glass Damn straight. They start to drink! and House finishes his glass first.,I'm definitely taller.
entering the restaurant with a gurney Someone call 911 for a wagon to Princeton-Plainsboro?,Garon!
You dosed him!,"I told you, I'd check him out."
I know. You made milk come out of my nose. House enters.,Morning. You guys got the file? What's wrong?
Previous tests rEvealed nothing that would cause abdominal pain or the mood swings.,"Then we're done! What do you think, ball game, zoo? I don't care, I just want to hang with you guys."
What about drugs? His tox screen on admission showed a massive amount of chloral hydrate.,"Yeah, sorry, that was me. I had to dope him up to get him in here. Guy doesn't think he's sick."
Guy doesn't think he's sick. Who does?,His wife.
The Woman you used to live with.,That's her Indian name. On her driver's license it's Stacy. I assume you have a point.
You beliEve her over the Patient himself. That's why we're taking this case.,"The truth, I hear voices. All the time. Telling me to do stuff, it's crazy, huh?"
What happened to Everybody lies?,I was lying.
heading to his office Did I miss anything? Kitchen sink?,"Well, we could certainly give that a oh, you minx."
"What you're thinking is, you're going to save him, be a hero, and win her back. It's always impressive, that lEvel of twisted narcissism.",She's married. Big clue I lost the game.
You can't be within fifty feet of Stacy Warner.,I thought she wanted me to treat him.
Treat the husband. Stay away from the wife.,But what if they get close to each other? What do I do then?
"Hey, you have to treat this like a regular case. House gets into the elevator. Be yourself cold, uncaring, distant.","Please, don't put me on a pedestal."
"MRAs were clean, which means he's pRobably fine. He doesn't seem paranoid, he shows no signs of","No, it means we have no idea what's wrong with him. Foreman walks up."
Ben Goldstein says the schedule's locked. He can't do it before tomorrow.,"No, today. Call him. Tell him I'll make it work."
as Foreman walks off again You're cutting him open?,"to Foreman Whoa, hold it! There's no need for exploratory surgery, Dr. Cameron has a diagnosis."
"No, I just think it's premature and maybe irresponsible to do exploratory surgery before we know he's actually sick.","No, it's premature to put him on a list for hospice care."
All we have is his wife,Who says that his stomach hurts. Works for me.
The Patient doesn't Even think he's sick. Why would he consent,"His wife's a Lawyer. She's very convincing. Call Goldstein, surgery's on. House walks off, then Chase and Foreman, leaving Cameron standing in the hall with her mouth hanging open."
"Leslie vs. Leslie seems to be right in point, but I'm sure they're going to try to distinguish it by she pauses as something is said over the overhead speaker sorry, they'll try to distinguish it by relying on the minority opinion. A paper coffee cup is thrust under her nose, held by one Dr. House.","Double milk, no sugar."
I like sugar now. House sits next to Stacy. They both look bored and somewhat anxious. House keeps tapping his cane on the floor. Some people would be annoyed by that. House taps on the floor a few more times.,You know why people sit in waiting rooms?
This is gonna be good.,"People think the closer they're sitting to the operating room, the more they care."
That's why I'm here. I'm not moving until Everybody sees me.,Are you doing anybody besides Mark? She looks at him. It's a medical question.
"Because if I am his paranoia isn't paranoia, it's a justified response? Therefore, not a legitimate symptom?",Knew you'd understand.
"Mrs. Warner. The surgery went well he's in recovery, you can see him now. She leaves House stands. Quietly to House -- Goldstein found nothing but a distended bladder.",Neurogenic bladder isn't causing the pain.
"Also doesn't cause personality changes. On the other hand, it would completely account for Cameron's diagnosis the Patient's completely healthy.",Give me the video for the surgery.
Give me the video for the surgery.,"Dr. Mandingo, you're needed at the plantation House."
"Dr. Mandingo, you're needed at the plantation House.","Well, don't Everybody talk at once. He pops a couple of Vicodin."
There's nothing there. House follows Cameron's eyes to what she's really looking at a empty bottle of whisky.,Stop looking at the suspiciously empty bottle and look at the screen.
Means there's some sort of neurological pRoblem.,"A time bomb in his brain. I forget, who said it was nothing?"
Saw a very small diffuse abnormality in the brain waves. PRobably white matter. Means his axonal nerves are dying. Explains the neurogenic bladder.,"Enough nerves die, he dies."
Early onset Alzheimer's. The worst.,He won't die right away. He'll just want to.
We'll check his blood for Alzheimer's protein markers.,Last I heard Alzheimer's had a genetic component. Patient have parents?
checks the history Parents died in a car crash. No history of dementia.,"Send CSF or CBC and viral serologies to rule out encephalitis, and get Tal proteins to check for Alzheimer's. And this wielding the history still feels a little light."
I took a complete medical history.,to Foreman Check out their House. Take SParky with you.
"They live in Short Hills, two hours away.",You can expense the tolls.
You're not interested in the medical history. You're a Peeping Tom trying to spy on your ex.,to Foreman and Chase as they leave Her secret diary that's the main thing.
"Regularly used, could lead to neurotoxicity. Explains the axonal nerve damage and the personality issues. House picks up the bottle.","On the other hand, prescribed to W. Brown."
"Fake name, fake prescription.","Could be, but the prescribing doc, his name's real. This guy's just had his license pulled for writing illegal prescriptions to high school kids."
Mark's a high school guidance counselor.,And Mr. Brown's birth date makes him 17-years-old. You think maybe these were confisCated by a high school guidance counselor? He pockets the bottle. Anything else?
"Uh, yeah, he switched from mountain biking to yoga, could have been indication",He's getting older. What did the CSF say about encephalitis?
"Said no. Champagne tap. No red cells, no white cells, serology's negative.",Which means we're back to Alzheimer's.
I told her he didn't have it. The marker tests were negative.,"Well, then you should have told her that."
"Yeah. First we're gonna map out some specific brain functions, check out the engine before we take the car for a drive. Foreman enters the room next to the maParkne, and finds House hiding in wait. Checking up on me?","I like all the pretty lights. The tech injects the chemical, and Mark starts to enter the maParkne."
Find a mailbox and mail it.,"Jeez, what a guy. His frontal lobe is working way better than mine. into the mike You remember when you got married?"
"Three years ago this July, who is that?",What? There could be a pRoblem with his long-term memory. in the mike Big church wedding?
Is that House?,He remembers voices.
This serves no diagnostic purpose.,"I thought you skimped on the limbic system, there. Emotional reactions, I just want to be thorough. in the mike Did the atheistic bride wear a pretty, white dress?"
Was she thinking of you? Is that what you medically need to know?,What jewelry did your bride wear?
"She nEver wears any jewelry. Except that cross her mother gave to her. No underwear, either. At least, not that day. I remember because she ripped her pretty, white dress off in the car. Is that the sort of answer you're looking for, Doctor?",I think I upset him.
I remember the Honeymoon was in Paris. I remember because we didn't leave the room for two weeks. You want the details on that?,A little defensive.
It's not paranoia if someone's out to get you.,Here we go. Stacy shoves him.
"He's sick, paranoid, and you keep hammering him about me?",The questions were designed to define the operational parameters of his limbic system
"Elevate the words all you want, you were just screwing with him. Low Even by your standards.",Medical screwing. It's what I do.
And then you run away like a 12-year-old. Go hide on the roof like you always do.,I haven't been up here in five years.
"It nEver occurred to me that you couldn't figure out what's wrong. Stacy starts to cry, and House walks over to hug her.",I haven't given up.
So what do we do?,We wait.
We wait. For what?,"Something to change. It's one of the great tragEdies of life, something always they break apart, something always changes."
"CGI cam goes into Mark's eye, and through neural passages that seem to short out at the end. What's happening?",Time marches on. He's paralyzed.
"But he's experiencing significant paresthesias, and he can't move his hands or toes.","It's peripheral. Guillain-Barre syndrome attacks there, not the brain."
"No, no. I already did an indirect Coombs' test. No glutination, no antibodies!",Initiative! Like that. Start him on IV immunosuppress
"No antibodies means he doesn't have Guillain-Barre, period!",Period? More like dot dot dot. What if he has the virus but isn't producing those antibodies?
"Come on, the chances of that are","I didn't ask about the Vegas line, I said what if?"
So we either fight it for him or it's fatal.,Fatal sounds very bad to me.
But without the antibodies we can't Even test for it. We don't know if we're right.,"The treatment isn't all that dangerous, plasmapheresis and IVIG. If it works, we're right. If he dies, it was something else."
"Mark, what you're feeling, it's not real. It's the virus. Mark starts to choke Cameron looks into his mouth with her penlight. Mark? His throat's closing up, he can't breathe. Code blue! Nurses rush in. He's having a reaction to the IVIG, I need epi stat! She tries to tube him but he keeps jerking around. I can't get the scope in his throat!",Stop that.
He's having an allergic reaction and he's crashing!,"No, he's not."
You couldn't just walk into the room?,He's had five visitors drive down.
"Shockingly, Mark has friends, and I have some new ones.","No, it's not shocking that you have new friends. But it is shocking that you apparently dumped all your old ones."
But it is shocking that you apparently dumped all your old ones. I haven't.,"No, I didn't think so."
I've been busy! I haven't kept track of who knows what.,"See, my old friends are telling me to be careful. They seem to think"
He. And he sent me the bear.,Figures.
What's your point? That I'm still in love with you? I should abandon my dying husband and we should head for Rio?,No.
She walks off. What's up?,"Love the bear, it was adorable."
"My wife's going to kill me. We're having company, she cooked.","I got Mark's latest blood work, he's not responding to treatment."
"I got Mark's latest blood work, he's not responding to treatment. I'm sorry.",I was happy.
"I was happy. He's my Patient. I'm sure he's a good guy, he's pRobably a great guy. PRobably a much better guy than I am. And some part of me wants him to die. I'm just not sure if it's because I want to be with her or if it's because I want her to suffer.",Hey. Is it okay if I talk to Stacy for a minute?
"I'll be just outside, Honey.",You two are good together.
You know nothing about Mark.,"He took you to Paris, that's good enough for me."
We nEver went to Paris.,"Your Honeymoon. It's been your dream city, you wanted to go since you were sixteen, he actually took you."
"No, I had to work. We spent the night in New York, then went back to Short Hills. What is it?",When did Mark switch from mountain biking to yoga?
"About a month ago. The same time he started getting sick, what does that mean?",We have two more symptoms.
We have two more symptoms.,Patient was asked a series of questions to determine the functionality of his brain.
You grilled him about Stacy.,WhatEver.
"He said he went to Paris and the PET confirms it, so what?",They didn't go.
But there are other symptoms of AIP.,Such as?
Such as? Light sensitivity?,"Yeah, well, one of the true tragEdies of this condition is it makes you want to stick your cool, new mountain bike in the garage and take up an indoor sport like, say, yoga."
And there's no way to predict when he'll have another attack.,Sure there is.
Sure there is.,"Acute Intermittent Porphyria has very specific triggers. Barbiturates, alcohol, high lEvels of protein set off an attack."
Which trigger do you think set off Mark's?,"Not the faintest idea, that's why I'm going to give him the combo plate."
"So if he has this, and you trigger the attack, the attack makes him worse. Right?",Yeah. But then we'll know what it is and we can treat it.
What if I don't have this thing and you give me that shot? What happens?,No idea. If we don't know what's messing up your brain we don't know how you'll react.
"Okay, I need a minute with my husband. The team leaves. Mark is shown talking through the glass, then Stacy gets up and leaves. He doesn't want the trigger. He wants to wait, see if we can come up with another explanation. If it is the AIP, how much time does he have?","No idea. Next attack could be fatal. Could be six months from now, could be five minutes from now."
I want you to test him.,"Fine. I'll send for a HMB synthetase mutation, genetic test. Lab will get back to us in a month."
"Give him the cocktail, set off an attack.",No.
No. Why not?,Because he doesn't want me to.
I'm not going to sue you. I'm not going to report you.,He might.
"He's paralyzed! Either you cure him, or he won't be writing any letters.",I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna do it. Why not?,"You keep asking me that question my answer doesn't change. I gave him the parameters, it's his call."
You want him to die.,"I diagnosed him, I did my job. You want somebody to tie him down and force him into treatment, well, you're way better at that than I am."
Is that what this is? Payback for your leg? How Many times have we been over this I saved your life.,"Yeah, maybe."
You're going to kill my husband to teach me a lesson?,"No, he's going to die because he's too stubborn to make the right choice."
Now we're in your territory.,"I'm respecting your husband's decision, I don't see why you've got a pRoblem with that."
"Because it's crap! Because you browbeat Patients, intimidate them, lie to them. If you think you're right you don't give a damn what they think. I did what you do all the time, the only difference is I did it to you.",He'll nEver forgive you.
Not like you do. I only met him when he drugged me.,"at the doorway Boy, are my ears burning."
"at the doorway Boy, are my ears burning. What's that?",holding up a syringe Cocktail hour. Just because you can't hoist a few doesn't mean you should be left out.
I would. I don't.,"Smart. Too bad you're paralyzed. He takes the IV to push the syringe, but Foreman stops him. Bing! Paging Dr. Foreman! Leave the room. It's not your pRoblem."
You need the consent from him.,"Doc, he ain't right in the head!"
Then you need a court order.,"Okay, then get one."
"near tears Please, if you're right this may be his only shot.",So what's your plan?
You son of a bitch!,See what I did there?
"checking Mark's vitals If he had AIP, it should have already happened.",Everyone's different.
"Is that an attack? Cameron runs over with the Ativan, but House swipes it away with his cane.","No, you'll pollute the sample! Chase, get urine from the catheter."
He needs Ativan!,This is not a stroke! Delta wave bursts just at the base of the spasm. The catheter falls to the floor.
"Heart rate's in the 40s, bradycardia, we're losing him!",Hold him down!
Give him something!,No pain killers!
"You were wrong! House doesn't listen, but grabs a syringe and sticks the needle into Mark's bladder, pulling out the urine sample.","Straight from the bladder, that's as fresh as it gets. Will you give him the Ativan already? He doesn't need to be awake for this."
It's still yellow.,grabbing a lamp Move.
You think another light's gonna make the difference?,Organic chem..
Dr. House? How's he doing?,looking in again NEver better.
You fixed him.,De nada.
Thank you. You were right.,He's gonna be fine.
"No, about me. I'm not over you. You were, you were the one, you always will be. But I can't be with you.","So I'm the guy, but you want the other guy, who by definition can nEver be the guy."
"What's so great about you, you always think you're right. What's so frustrating about you is you are right so much of the time. You are brilliant, funny, surprising, sexy! but with you I was lonely, and with Mark there's room for me.","Okay. Stacy kisses him on the cheek, then leaves."
I want to run something by you.,"loudly I will not have sex with you! Not again! Miserable, that first time. All that desperate, administrative need"
"Stacy's husband is going to need close monitoring at the hospital. And since we can definitely use her back here, I've offered her a job. General Counsel.",Did she say yes?
She said only if it was okay with you. House starts to walk off as The Rolling Stones' You Can't Always Get What You Want plays ironically in the background. Yes or no?,Fine. Good.
You can't go in there.,"Who are you, and why are you wearing a tie?"
I'm Dr. Cuddy's new assistant. Can I tell her what it's regarding?,Yes. I would like to know why she gets a secretary and I don't.
"I'm her assistant, not her secretary. I graduated from Rutgers.",Hmm.
"Dr. House, we are in the middle of a meeting.",What's with hiring a male secretary? JDate not working out?
He is cute. Be careful.,She's not like you. She can't just walk into a bar and pick up her soul mate in twenty minutes.
I met Mark at a fundraiser that happened to be held at a,You met me at a strip club.
If you have a pRoblem working with Stacy you should have said so.,What was I supposed to do? Ask her to leave? That's just rude. Death row guy. I want the case.
How do you Even know about him? You don't have access to the hospital's mainframe.,"No, but partypants does."
You stole my password?,Hardly counts as stealing it's a pretty obvious choice.
"Well, I have already assigned Death Row Guy to Dr. Nolo.","Nolo? Well, I don't want to say anything bad about another doctor, but! especially a useless drunk!"
You are addicted to pain pills.,But I'm not useless. Tell Nolo I'm talking over.
Dr. Nolo is a board certified cardiologist.,"Oh, good."
How badly do you want this?,I will give you two more clinic hours this week.
"Just the heart, or the Patient have any other complaints?",The Patient's not talking to anybody.
Where are we going?,You are going to the clinic for two hours.
You are going to the clinic for two hours. Me? Why?,"Talk to Cuddy. She's got me going to Mercer State Prison, Capital Sentences unit, I don't know."
Aren't there better ways to spend our time?,Good question. What makes a person deserving? Is a Man who cheats on his wife more deserving than a Man who kills his wife?
"Uh! yeah. Actually, he is.",What about a Parkld molester?
"Your Patient shanked one inmate his first month here, broke another one's neck, nearly decapitated one of my guards!","Relax, I've got a great bedside Manner."
"Too dangerous to House him in the infirmary. You don't have to worry, we've taken Every precaution. I've had my men clear from the cell all pens, paperclips and staplers. Any supplies that might be used as a weapon. We see Clarence, shackled to a cot in a room full of office supplies. Open her up! For your visit, we've got him cuffed and shackled.","And yet, you're staying out there."
All she has is a cough.,"Bluish tinge to the fingernails, lips! he's hypoxic."
What's that mean?,It means he's not getting enough oxygen.
Don't have a respirator.,"Better get one in about an hour, or you're gonna lose him."
I'll make out a requisition. The state's already sentenced this Man to die.,flipping open his cell phone I think the state was a tad more specific about how.
"Wasted call, my men will stop them at the gate. No way a Death Row inmate leaves my prison, at least not through the front doors.",You work fast.
So do you.,Was that a shot?
"Yeah. It was easy once I convinced the clerk to take it to Judge Markem, she's a sucker for Eighth Amendment arguments.","Stop, I'm getting turned on."
"Stop, I'm getting turned on. House!",in his best Scooby-Doo imitation Ruh-row!
It was just a consult! You expect us to shut down an entire floor for this guy?!,Did you do something to your hair?
You said you cleared with her,Come on. You've known me how long and you still don't know when I'm joshin' ya?
Take him back to prison. Now.,"No, can't."
"No, can't. See, ironically I'm bound by this court order which your ace attorney got. I have to make him all better before shipping him back for the state to kill him. Is it just me, or is that weird? Anyway, we're walking.",Somebody left this on my chair. It's clEver. Forces me to either deal with the file or nEver sit down again.
Cindy Kramer. I told her you'd see her.,"You shouldn't have told her that. She's got metastatic squamous cell lung cancer, six months, tops."
Have you Even looked at the x-ray?,"No, just guessing. It's a new game. If I'm wrong, she gets a stuffed bear."
A spot on a x-ray doesn't necessarily mean that she's terminal.,I love Parkldren. So filled with hope.
It could be pneumonia. It could be sarcodosis.,"Could be, if she didn't already have swollen hilar lymph nodes on the other lung."
"Could we at least brainstorm for other ideas? He takes the x-ray and puts it up on the light board. Thank you. He begins to write on the board. I still think it could be pneumonia and sarcodosis, but we should check for tuberculosis and definitely rule out congestive heart failure. She looks to see that House has written denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance on the board. The five stages of dying.",Exactly.
following him in The Death Row guy? That's who you're working on instead of Cindy?,"God, I've got to learn not to beat around the bush."
I took an oath to do no harm.,"Yeah, well, it's not like they make you sign it or anything."
"We cure your Patient, he goes back to Death Row. He goes back to Death Row, they kill him!","He stays here and we don't treat him, he dies, and I still don't treat Cindy Lou-Who."
Can we get on with this?,"Yeah, I knew I could count on your help for your homie."
"sarcastically Exactly, I'm black. I sympathize for guys who grew up in the city kept down by the Man. Chase smirks.",Makes sense to me.
Are you serious?,The Man knows prisons.
He starts to move around violently. Water! water.,What's the differential for being thirsty?
"Blood and urine tests came back clean, no sign of opiates in his system. Cameron grabs a marker and is about to write on the board, when!",Don't do that.
"What, you have some House theory explaining heroin use despite a negative test?",Nope.
His bi-carb is low.,"Yeah, but which column? Could be the result of the tachycardia, could be the cause?"
It's the cause.,"Why, because you want it to be? Let's see how well that works with your other Patient."
We're just talking seMantics here. We should put him on a bi-carb drip and send him back.,"Right, buff his numbers. Don't bother trying to figure out the underlying cause. I thought you cared about Patients."
"Our job isn't to make sure he can bounce his grandkids on his lap, our job is to get him healthy enough to go back to Death Row.",closing the blinds so he can't see Stacy Our job is to diagnose him.
"Were you trying to get me fired? If you didn't want me working here, why didn't you just say so?","I just don't want you working right here, in my office. But anywhere else in the building is fine. It's a big hospital."
I'm a Lawyer. You're a jerk. There's gonna to be some overlap.,"God, I hope that was a euphemism."
Cuddy just reamed me.,I hope that one means what I think it means.
For trusting you! She figured when she hired me she'd at least have someone you couldn't walk all over.,"The number was six, by the way."
"I need to know, can I trust you?","If I hadn't lied to you about Cuddy's approval, my Patient would be dead."
Blood gas came back with a pH of 7.28 and decreased HCO3.,Which means two things.
"What if Clarence thought he was taking heroin, but it was something else?",What something else could lead to anion gap acidosis?
What something else could lead to anion gap acidosis? Mudpiles.,"Well, you don't have to ask. Just wash your hands before you come back."
"Methanol, uremia, diabetes!","Oh, it's a mnemonic. That makes sense, too."
"Paraldehyde, INH, lactic acid",Rewind.
Rewind. INH?,Yahtzee!
Nearly a quarter of the prison population is infected with TB.,"ClEver entrepreneur like Foreman here, chops up his meds, passes it off as heroin."
INH poisoning would explain all the symptoms.,Who wants to head over to the prison and find Clarence's secret stash? No one looks too thrilled.
"Fine, I'll do it.","Great, Chase it is."
I assume you have a reason beyond wanting to make me completely miserable?,You've got a prettier mouth. Better chance the inmates will open up to you.
The Man's in a coma.,He didn't mind. I asked.
You're getting crumbs all over him.,"Why do you think they put TVs in coma Patients' rooms, anyway?"
Some people think they can still hear.,So leave them a radio. His eyes are closed who thinks they can see? Wilson sits on the opposite side of the bed.
Do you know why people are nice to other people?,"Oh, I know this one."
"Exactly. You're gonna eat these Parkps? He reaches for them, but House grabs them away.",You gonna get to your point?
You need people to like you.,I don't care if people like me.
"!Yes. But you need people to like you because you need people. Unless you think you can get the next court order yourself. If Stacy can't trust you, you can't use her. House hands over the Parkp bag. And that's not Even dealing with the greater agenda House takes the bag back before Wilson can have any of getting her to dump her husband and fall in love with you all over again.","Look I know you're friends with her, but there is a code."
What is it?,Death Row guy is dying.
"Bradycardia. His heart rate's dropped to 30, it's not going to hold that much longer.","Are you just waiting to call time of death, or are you gonna give him atropine?"
"Are you just waiting to call time of death, or are you gonna give him atropine? Temporary fix?",Right. Don't know why those diabetics are all hung up on insulin. They're just gonna have to have to take more. He starts to push the Atropine into the IV.
Atropine's only gonna buy you a few hours! We don't Even know what's wrong with him,Just get out of here. Foreman leaves as Clarence's heart rate starts to climb.
on cell This is Chase.,from the hospital desk near Diagnostics Did you beat any confessions out of anybody?
I haven't spoken to any inmates.,Does anybody do their jobs anymore?
I've decided Clarence's life isn't worth risking mine for.,I appreciate your candor. Did you Even go to the prison or are you just out playing polo?
"I'm searParkng both Clarence's cells. I figure, if he's on something, it's stashed somewhere.",Unless he finished it.
"Yeah, that'd be a shame. He could have shoved it anywhere, there's envelopes stacked to the ceiling, bottles of copier toner, boxes of rubber bands he goes on, but House has heard enough",Call it off. Come on back.
What's going on?,You're dying. -- and takes out a bottle of rum and pours two shots' worth. A Man deserves a last drink.
A Man deserves a last drink. You're okay.,Thanks. That means a lot. He helps Clarence to drink his shot.
I work for one of the top diagnosticians in the country. We're pouring all of our energy into figuring this out.,slurred slightly Thought you convicts knew how to drink.
"House She stops short as she sees House laughing and pouring shots. I was just waiting for test results, I was!",Little busy right now. Getting my drink on.
Oof. That's the finest piece I've seen in ten years.,I could've hit that.
And you didn't.,Eh.
Then you're the one that should be locked up.,"Tell me something, I've been trying to figure this out."
"It just hit me all of a sudden. It was like, they tell me when to eat, when to sleep, when to walk, when to talk, Everything. I had to take control of something, right? When to die, I figured that was as good as anything.",pouring more rum And that thought just came to you. Just like that.
"Man, I told you. Twenty-three hours a House forces another shot down his throat.",Mmm.
"Man, you are drunk.","Yes, I am. I also saved your life. And, a shot for House! Laughing At least for now."
Morning! House winces at the sound. Your head hurt?,"No, you just have a very grating voice."
You always were a light weight.,Why are you talking to me?
"Can't it be enough that I want to cause you pain? The Patient's okay now, you're going to send him back?",Absolutely.
You used to.,I still think the Patient's sick.
"Yeah, I have. With contrast?",entering She's done Everything she needs to do except tell her Patient that she's dying.
I'm not telling Cindy she's dying until the diagnosis is confirmed.,I'm not buying that CLARENCE is trying to take control of his life by suicide. Healthy people don't kill themselves.
Healthy people don't kill other people.,Guy just filed an appeal in a state that hasn't actually killed anybody in about 30 years.
"What if it wasn't suicide? What if it was an escape plan? Drink enough methanol to get transferred to a hospital, try to escape from here?",Excellent.
"You killed four people. Somehow, making mac and cheese just the way he wants kind of loses its significance.",Oh no. Now you've left your entire body in my chair. What does that mean you want?
I need a segmental bronchoalveolar lavage.,I take it the CT with contrast came back.
They're not definitive.,Biopsy would be.
Biopsy would be invasive and unnecessary.,"And definitive. But you don't want definitive, you want to hang on to your delusions as long as you can."
A lavage could prove it's not cancer.,But you need me to approve the procedure. Must be a bitch. The answer is no.
"Why? Because it's me? I'm over you. I've jumped on the bandwagon. I hate you, okay?",Great. Let's treat her.
"What is it? You won't help Cindy but you're obsessed with this piece of dirt! Are you just trying to prove that who someone is doesn't matter, that all that matters is your stupid puzzle? Fine. Treat them the same. That's all I'm asking. One test.","Wow, that is remarkable."
Your Death Row guy's still here!,"Yeah, sorry. Just gotta get him stabilized. PRobably keep him on fluids for a few more hours, then off he goes."
Oh yeah? 'Cause I'm figuring that you still think he's sick.,"Figuring requires deductive reasoning. I'm figuring that you did no figuring. Stacy just ratted me out, right? So much for attorney-client privledge."
"I'm the client, you moron. Stacy has a duty to this hospital.",Right.
I'm sending him back to prison.,"Whoa, can't. Court order."
Would you describe it as a shooting pain? A thRobbing pain? Or maybe an imaginary pain because you don't want to go back to prison?,Where does it hurt?
"My gut, I feel like I'm getting stabbed! Screams again.","Well, he'd know. Let me take a look."
"Oh, so Everybody lies except a convicted murderer. CGI shot of some nasty stuff in Clarence's bowels. Ew. House removes the covers to rEveal blood flowing out of Clarence's nether regions. More ew.","I don't think he's faking this stuff. What do you think, Doctor? Clarence screams a lot more for emphasis."
I didn't have any choice.,"No, you had to tell Cuddy. She's your boss, I get it. Hitler thought he was doing the world a favor, too."
"Yeah, pretty much on that same lEvel.","Gandhi didn't march the sea because his buddies asked him too, Pol Pot didn't wipe out the teachers because he wanted to make friends."
You're not making friends right now.,I trusted you.
I trusted you. I know.,Wilson's a fool. I'm an idiot.
I had to do what I thought was right.,It's the only reason anybody does anything.
The surgery went fine. They removed almost a foot of necrotic bowel. They're shackling him and taking him to recovery.,I wonder. I wonder why Clarence killed that second inmate.
"Fine, I'll bite. What the hell are you talking about?",Everything we do is dictated by motive. As he erases the white board Why did he kill his girlfriend?
Because he's a Maniac!,Is that the reason he gave?
She was cheating on him.,"Jealousy. He writes it on the board. That gets him sent to prison, where he kills inmate number one. Why?"
Guy attacked him first.,REvenge. Who'd he killed after that?
Who'd he killed after that? Prison guard.,Who had a file full of abusive complaints. PRobably been kicking Clarence's ass for months.
Clarence is just ridding the world of bad seeds.,Call that one retribution. Then he kills inmate number two. Anybody know why? Chase looks through the file. Nuh-uh. It's not in there. He draws a giant question mark.
All of a sudden I got to have a reason?,It's an anomaly.
"It happened when I was in gen-pop. I was in the library, just readin', and I started feelin' real nervous. This guy was staring at me, I could feel his eyes digging holes in the back of my neck, it made me feel crazy. Sweat was pouring down my face. I could hear my heartbeat racing in my ears. I just raged out on the dude.",So what's the differential for raging out?
"Excess testosterone, steroids Adrenaline",Prep Clarence for surgery.
Care to share with the class.,"Oh, come on."
But pheo's extremely rare.,I love rare. Set up an MRI. Where's Cameron? They shrug. Like I don't know.
She goes back in. Pheo what?,I don't Even remember.
But not for me?,I assume you got those tattoos in prison.
I assume you got those tattoos in prison. Prison tats often contain inks with heavy metals. The MRI's basically a giant magnet. It'd suck those metallic inks right out of your skin.,Stop squirming. Don't make us do this again. Big baby.
Turn it off!,"There's Waldo. Found it, Clarence."
Turn it off! Turn this damn thing off!,Keep him in there until you guys see it too. He leaves.
Looks like they got the pheo out successfully. So what now?,Clarence goes back to Death Row.
Just like that?,He's cured.
"That tumor caused random shots of adrenaline, which obviously led to the rage attacks that made him become a murderer in the first place.","My God, you're right! Let's call the surgeons, we've got to save that tumor. Put it on the witness stand."
We could testify at Clarence's appeal.,sniffs You smell that?
A person's upbringing and their biology are completely different.,Yeah.
You want him to be executed?,That's not what I'm saying.
Got an opinion?,"Everyone's got an opinion. Foreman turns to leave as Hallelujah, the most overused great song in media begins to play."
"I, um, I think I'm gonna testify at Clarence's appeal.",You'll do what you think is right. On your own time. He leaves.
House! Need you.,"Uh uh, forget it. I'm going home."
I'm going home. Hay fEver?,"Boy, you must be a doctor and Everything!"
"Boy, you must be a doctor and Everything! Two minutes.","No, the purple thingy on the file means that whoEver is one of yours, which means cancer, which means no way is it two minutes."
"Fine, I'm lying. 30 minutes.",Mystery of life.
Benadryl might help.,I already did 1000 milligrams. He sneezes
He sneezes Steam room?,Why Jimmy. We'll talk about this in the morning.
I've got a nine year old with cancer. Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma. Terminal kid trumps your stuffy nose.,Not yet.
She's hallucinating. He said the magic word,So the Rhabdo's in her brain. Make her comfortable she's got about a week.
"Yeah except there is no cancer in her brain. Pristine CT scan, blood tests, protein markers all negative.",The cancer's in remission? Which means the hallucinations are unconnected.
Fascinating huh? And not that it matters but if you fix whatEver's going on in her head you give her maybe another year. Long time for a nine year old.,No. It'll just fly by.
If it was me I'd just stay home and watch TV or something. Not lie here under a microscope.,"Don't worry, anything happens to you nobody's is going to lift a finger. Differential diagnosis on your marks, get set!"
Hallucinations could be caused by!,Whoa. Wait for it! Pause and go.
"No, nothing on mom. Dad split when she was pregnant Cameron hands House a cup of tea his medical history is also clean.",What a guy.
Blood work and LP were clean.,Looking at the scan But where there's infection there's meningial swelling.
That CT shows no meningial involvement.,True. Get a tox screen and MRI.
We can do that if you want to ignore what we just discussed.,Sounds good.
Toxic exposure doesn't make chronological sense.,"Yes, there is a third option she's making it all up because she doesn't want to get in trouble for breaking a mirror."
What'd I do?,"Oh well, you'd just get all warm and cuddly around the dying girl and insinuate yourself end up in a custody battle."
Black walnut and ginger.,It's nice.
A pro. I like it.,Whoa look at the time I should have been out of here 20 minutes ago.
You've only been here 20 minutes.,Can't slip anything by you can I.
There's a Patient in one.,I'm taking a sick day.
Take some Claritin.,Everyone's a doctor suddenly.
"Balls are in your court, Doctor.",Union rules. I can't check out this guy's seeping gonorrhea this close to lunch.
Exam room one.,Well it's sexist and a very dangerous precedent if people could choose the sex of their doctors you gals would be out of business.
Exam room one.,Sore throat?
My new girlfriend nEver been with a guy who wasn't c-circumcised so she freaked and,"Aha, and you wanted Rivkah to feel all gemutlicht. I get it it's a shandah."
I got some box cutters and uh!,Just like Abraham did it.
"I sterilized them which, uh, I was told you're!",Stop talking. I'm gonna get a plastic surgeon. Get the Twinkie back in the wrapper.
"House. Hey, House. Andie's MRI and tox screen were clean. No infection. No neurotoxins.","Oxygen saturation is 94%, check her heart."
Her oxygen saturation is normal.,It's off by one percentage point.
It's within range. It's normal.,If her DNA was off by one percentage point she'd be a dolphin.
But the lungs could lead us somewhere that is.,Welcome to the end of the thought process.
Could be some bizarre case of kyphoscoliosis. Chase laughs,I'm going home.
What if it is? Please kiss me.,Bagels.
You didn't sleep in.,Didn't sleep. Didn't breathe. I'm dying.
Pulmonary angiogram of Andie's lungs was clean. Arterial blood gasses and a CT scan were also normal. Her heart and lungs are fine.,Which gives us no explanation for the diminished sat percentage.
Yeah oddly enough sometimes normal is normal.,Sometime we can't see why normal isn't normal. Get her symptoms on the board.
Whoa you're letting me touch the markers?,"It's written down in my advanced health care directive, should I be incapacitated in any way you run the board, then Foreman. Chase you're just not ready yet. What else?"
She's hiding it pretty well if there's any of that going on.,"Yeah, all girls who've been molested want to talk about it. Break out the rape kit."
She hasn't had sex.,Why are you so sure?
She told me she'd nEver kissed a boy.,You read her diary too?
She asked me to kiss her.,"I rest my case. A regular nine year old girl does not have sex on the brain, not when a doctor is threading a catheter through her vein."
But she's not a regular nine year old. She's got terminal cancer.,Cancer doesn't make you special. Molestation on the other hand!
She wanted one kiss before she dies. If she's nEver kissed a boy it's a fair bet she's nEver had sex.,Tell that to all the hookers who won't kiss me on the mouth.
It wasn't sick. Foreman and Cameron freak out quietly It was one kiss for a dying girl. One small! one small kiss before she dies. Thank you. Thanks.,This is exactly why you can't touch my markers. Go see if she's had sex.
With a Patient.,Is she dying?
Is she dying? No.,Then she can wait.
"Would you excuse me, just 2 minutes.",If only she'd been molested then we'd have something to go on. He tries to open a jar of mentholatum No forced entry.
"One hallucination maybe it was just bad pork, maybe there's nothing!",She's not fine. Her sat percentage dropped another point.
Which could suggest a tumor in her lung.,"Lung wouldn't explain the hallucination. CT scan showed both lungs were clean, which means there's a tumor in her heart."
Not a chance. Give me that.,I loosened it.
"I opened it. We've got an MRI and an echo of her heart, there's nothing there.",Give me one other explanation for low oxygen saturation.
I can't. There's only one condition that simultaneously affects the heart and the brain but she!,Perfect let's go with that.
Tuberous Sclerosis in a kid that also has Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma. Two different unrelated cancers at the same time is a statistical no no.,"What's the rate of cancer in the general population? 1 in 10,000?"
"Don't, don't start with the numbers.","The way I figure it 1 in 10,000 of them should have another cancer. Little girl won the lottery twice. It happens."
So you're gonna cut her open?,"Exploratory surgery, gotta find this thing."
You're just going to grope around inside an immuno-compromised nine year old? She could die on the table.,I know it's somewhere near the heart.
Why are we here?,Better acoustics. Now listen to this.
That's a mitral heart valve.,"No, get the wax out of your ears. This is the Patient's aortic valve. I downloaded the audio of her echocardiogram."
What are we trying to hear?,Tumor.
They tend to keep quiet on account of them not having any mouths.,"But we could hear an abnormality in the sound of the valve, which would indiCate the presence of something a tumor for example."
Her aortic valve sounds normal.,Too bad. Now listen to the dulcet tones of Andie's tricuspid valve.
Now listen to the dulcet tones of Andie's tricuspid valve. Normal.,And this is her mitral valve.
I don't hear anything weird.,You guys make me sad. Listen again.
She's had one hallucination. Why are we operating on her? Why are we risking her life?,Because Wilson thinks it'll be nice to give the girl a year to say good bye to her mommy.
Wait. There. There's an extra flap.,"I'm gonna ask the surgeon to look at the mitral valve first. Chase, I want you there. I don't like reading surgeons reports, they're boring."
I'm not really sure I should be spending more time!,She'll be unconscious you'll be safe.
"Brave kid, she Even gave her mom a pep talk.",Sure. Brave. She's a wonder.
What's your pRoblem?,These cancer kids you can't put them all on a pedestal. It's basic statistics some of them have to be whiny little fraidy cats.
It's basic statistics some of them have to be whiny little fraidy cats. You're unbelievable.,If there's not one yellow-belly in the group then being brave doesn't have any meaning.
Andie handles an impossible situation with grace. That's not to be admired?,You see grace because you wanna to see grace.
You don't see grace because you won't go anywhere near her.,Idolizing is pathological with you people. You see things to admire where there's nothing.
"Yeah, well, we're evil.",You find things to admire where you shouldn't be sniffing at all like Debbie in accounting.
You find things to admire where you shouldn't be sniffing at all like Debbie in accounting. She's nice.,"You shouldn't know that, you're married."
"So the little kid dying of cancer, I shouldn't like her?",If you're dying suddenly Everybody loves you.
"You have a cane, nobody Even likes you.","I'm not terminal, merely pathetic you wouldn't beliEve the crap people let me get away with."
She's got a bleed in her eye.,"They got the tumor, repaired her heart but she bled out of her eye."
She didn't bleed out of her eye from a heart tumor.,True. The cardiac tumor was benign.
The cardiac tumor was benign. That's impossible.,Statistically.
Oh shut up. If the tumor's benign that means it didn't cause her hallucinations.,That's why I'm mentioning it.
So the tumor is a coincidence.,This is bad you're starting to state the obvious.
"No, you said it would be there, it was there. It can't be a coincidence.",A nine year old with terminal cancer gets an unrelated benign tumor growing in her heart why?
It's benign? That's impossible.,Talk to Wilson.
What's the theory here? This girl's body's a lemon? Faulty Manufacturing? Everything's falling apart.,The tumor is Afghanistan the clot is Buffalo.
"Whoa, whoa, you're trying to say that the tumor threw a clot before we removed it.","It was an excellent metaphor, angio her brain for this clot before it straps on an explosive vest."
"It was an excellent metaphor, angio her brain for this clot before it straps on an explosive vest.",Angio was clean.
There's no clot?,"There's a clot, we just can't find it."
We can't do exploratory surgery on her brain.,Are you sure you're not a neurologist?
"Sighs Okay, she's gonna die.",Well the clots not gonna to go away quietly. It could blow at anytime. Are you gonna let them know?
To tell Andie she's going to die? That's very un-you.,She's such a brave girl. I want to see how brave she is when you tell her she's gonna die.
Go to hell.,What would you do if you were told you were gonna die?
"I don't know, I'd be devastated.","You'd cry like a baby, Everybody would, but she's not doing anything. She's a rock."
She's a rock. She's brave.,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why?
She's gone through more than most people do in a lifetime.,So what? Does that mean she's ready to die? What if her bravery is a symptom? The clot is causing hallucinations and messing with her emotions.
You think her bravery is chemically based.,Would tell us where to look for the clot. Where's the fears center?
The Amygdala near the hippocampus it's a big area and a busy one. You blindly cut in there you'll kill her. The only time you're going to see this clot is at autopsy.,Then let's do that.
Then let's do that.,Is it still illegal to perform an autopsy on a living person?
Are you high?,"If it's Tuesday, I'm wasted."
"If it's Tuesday, I'm wasted. It's Wednesday.",I want to induce a hypothermic cardiac arrest. Once the Patients on bypass we siphon off two liters of blood then perfuse the brain while she's in an MRI.
You're actually talking about killing her.,"Just for a little while, I'll bring her right back."
"Oh, well, in that case go ahead. Why are we Even talking?","If we do nothing she's dead in a day, maybe a week the kind that lasts."
We need FDA approval for any surgical technique that's used for diagnostic purposes.,"Absolutely. If we were doing anything invasive but there's nothing invasive. He almost sneezes Gah. You know, I'm not cutting into her head I'm just looking for a clot."
Not invasive? You're killing her.,"Don't split hairs, if it works she lives."
Make sure the mom understands that this is a million to one shot.,I'll see that Wilson passes that along.
Signed consent forms.,Great. Thanks.
You sound better.,"I stacked a combo of mentholatum, a few vicodin and something else which I can't remember."
Should be able to ride the high for a couple hours what did Andie say? About what?,About this.
I didn't talk to her she doesn't need to know the specifics of this procedure.,What if you're right about her? What if she just is that brave?
That doesn't mean she's mature enough to handle this kind of decision.,Either she understands or she's not brave. You can't have it both ways. If she does understand! then she deserves to know what's going on.
Either she understands or she's not brave. You can't have it both ways. If she does understand! then she deserves to know what's going on.,I'm doctor House.
I've seen you around.,Did your mom tell you what we're gonna try?
Did your mom tell you what we're gonna try? Sorta.,"Tomorrow's test could take ten hours, in your present condition you might not Even make it through."
My mom's done a lot of research.,"How do you feel about it? If we figured maturity came from how much time you've got left instead how long you've been here, this would be your call."
I don't have a choice right?,I could give you one.
I wanna get better.,You've got cancer. I fix this!
I've got a year.,A year of this. A lot of people wouldn't want that. A lot of people would just want it to be over.
Are you asking if I want to die?,"Nobody wants to die. But you're going to. The question is how, how much you're gonna suffer and how long. I'm asking if you want this to be over."
What would you tell my mom?,I could give her ten excellent medical reasons why we can't do this procedure.
I can't just leave her cause I'm tired.,But you can't stay for her either.
But she needs me here.,"This is your life, you can't do this just for her."
I love her.,Thank you for joining me for tonight's dress rehearsal.
"Thank you for joining me for tonight's dress rehearsal. Playing the part of Andie is Morty Randolph. He gestures at a cadaver For his donation to science we give our thanks. Once Andie is cool and goes off bypass we have 60 seconds to get 2 liters of blood out of her body and back into her for the pictures to find the clot in her head. IF our star is bumped tomorrow He barely touches the cadaver and lights start to flash while my MRI is on these red lights will go off which will mean we have no useable test results. No test results its goodbye Broadway. You guys will be wearing bad cat suits in Des Moines. Neurosurgeons here, with a view of the monitors. Cardiac surgeon there, in case we need to open her up. Anesthesiologists, one by the cardiac bypass maParkne, one by the cooling apparatus. Girls in the chorus if you're over 5' 10 stick with me. Okay give me 60 seconds on the clock. Showtime. A five, six, sEven, eight! siphon off the blood through the arterial line WHOOSH, sound of blood draining. More whoosh. Glug, glug, glug and we! Red lights Kill her. Again.",How hard can this be?
How hard can this be?,Again!
How hard can this be? Again!,Again!
Again! Again!,Again!
We could bolt her to the table.,"Gruesome and low tech. Kiss me I love it. A five, six, sEven, eight!"
Here you go doctor.,This'll make you sleep.
A lot of people.,Big musical number kiddo a lot of people here to make you look good.
He gets that sometimes.,Okay go.
He gets that sometimes. Okay go.,Start the cooling. You. Go.
Go. She's shivering.,200 milligrams of vecuronium.
200 milligrams of vecuronium.,What? She's dead that's the whole idea. Go.
What? She's dead that's the whole idea. Go.,Okay put the blood back in reperfuse the circuit.
Okay put the blood back in reperfuse the circuit.,Anything people? Anything at all?
Vestibulocolcular nerve intact.,Keep looking.
Keep looking. There!,I didn't see anything.
It was there.,Are you sure?
I saw it.,That's good enough for me.
You're treating your stuffy nose with cocaine?,Diphenhydramine. Antihistamine. New delivery system it's a blood brain barrier thing.
It's all about speed isn't it? One thing to another nEver standing still. You're pretty good at that.,I know my way around a razor blade.
I know my way around a razor blade. It's time.,Just a couple more rocks.
Andie's going home.,"Right, parade of the small bald circus freaks. Sorry, I got a thing."
I read the surgeon's report.,Oh?
Clot was nowhere near her Amygdala. Means her fear emotions were working perfectly.,Yeah.
Yeah. So her bravery was not a symptom.,Yeah.
She enjoys life more than you do.,Right.
She stole that kiss from Chase. What have done lately?,I'm pacing myself unlike her I have the luxury of time.
Handing her tickets to the American Museum of Natural History In case you want to see real butterflies. They hug and she kisses him on the cheek,I'm not gonna kiss you no matter what you say. She hugs him
"It's sunny outside, you should go for a walk.",He looks at his cane Not much for long walks in the Park. Now get.
Now get. Right leg?,Huh?
Your right leg? You can still ride. We've got excellent financing right now. It lists for 10-8 but I'll let you steal it out the door for 10-3.,No thanks. He starts to leave and then turns back Could I test drive one of these things?
How does falling off your roof do that to a guy's fingers?,Could have tweaked a vertebrae in his neck.
"Could have tweaked a vertebrae in his neck. Could have pinged on the ulnar!House is staring down at a red stain on Cuddy's tank top just below her breasts. Sorry, trouble concentrating. That tank top really absorbs moisture.","Could have pinged the ulnar nerve, cut the blood flow. Or it could be"
"DIC.? Guy falls off a roof, the first thought is it's always a clotting pRoblem",Trauma can activate the clotting enzymes. Guy could loose more than his hand.
Do I get bonus points if I act like I care?,"Cervical MRI, work up for DIC, and start him on a heparin drip"
"Cervical MRI, work up for DIC, and start him on a heparin drip Who?",You want to know his name? throws file down on the table I'm sure it's in the file.
You want to know his name? throws file down on the table I'm sure it's in the file.,"Or you could ask her. She's his oldest, bestest friend. They were in Cub Scouts together."
I'll get started on the blood tests.,"You haven't been a real doctor in ten years, you'll make a mess all over the sheet."
You have clinic duty. I still know how to handle a Patient.,Get me blood. Lots of blood.
Get me blood. Lots of blood.,They're better. They've showered.
"His PTT is prolonged, the fibrin split products are off, he's not clotting properly. It looks like a mild case of DIC.","Well, obviously not that mild."
All this from falling off my roof!,"Yeah, if only he'd fallen on his head. Then he wouldn't have any of these symptoms."
We need something stronger than heparin. HuMan activated protein C.,"Looks like Cuddy, same cleavage. Protein C is indiCated only for sEvere sepsis."
"Well, how Many of his limbs have to be at stake, for it to be sEvere?","But this stuff is crazy dangerous. It can cause internal bleeding. If he bleeds, he could stroke, he could die."
He could get better.,"You know, if I tried a scheme like this, you'd give me that nasty, wrinkly face and screech like a hyena."
"It's very sexy, I admit. Do it.",Protein C is border-line irresponsible. 'Cept that the safe stuff isn't doing squat.
This is exactly the type of thing you would do.,"Well, obviously."
You were just jerking Cuddy around?,You seriously thought I wanted to stop her?
One thing Cuddy is not is clueless.,"No, first causality of this case is her sense of humor."
"His fingers are Even darker, his temperature is 102 and spiking, and the x-ray now shows lung infiltrates.",The good news is he won't be bitParkng about losing his hand if he can't breathe.
The trauma from the fall could cause actuate respiratory distress syndrome.,"Right, I forgot. Your roof."
It would cause lung infiltrates and maybe fEver and conceivably the cyanotic fingers.,The only question is why?
The only question is why? Why what?,Why her weird psychopathology requires a diagnosis formed entirely by personal guilt.
Pneumonia doesn't hit that fast.,"Sure, only pavement hits that fast. It's not pneumonia. Might have missed a finger turning dark, he's not going to miss breathing pRoblems. What else?"
It's pneumonia. He wanted to go home. I thought he was lying. I told him I had a dinner party. I made him go up there.,"Well, why didn't you just take out a gun and shoot him?"
I thought it was just asthma.,"Might have mentioned this earlier, Doctor. Maybe we could have sent some blood cultures to the lab, instead of wasting a day indulging your self-loathing."
"If it's just garden-variety bacterial pneumonia, he's gonna be fine.",So give him garden-variety Levaquin and a garden-variety echo-cardiogram. And go check out the kid's House.
"The blood work will show us which type of pneumonia it is, if","If he's huffing nail polish, or pulling the wings off his pet parrot, this way will be faster."
It's Alfredo. And I can handle getting a key and,Rico and I no longer trust you deciding what's important and what's not.
You Ever think about writing a book on office politics?,Trust me. It would be a lot worse if I told her you have to break into her House.
"Wait, wait, wait. Cuddy's House?","See, it is shocking. Guy's been working there Every day for the last three weeks. Do you think it's impossible that he could have picked something up?"
I'm not breaking into my boss's House.,I'm your boss.
She's scarier than you are.,"Oh, she's a Woman. Relax, I'm coming with."
"No, nothing wrong with that.",What do you think? Red thongs? I think red thongs. 'Kay!
What do you think? Red thongs? I think red thongs. 'Kay!,Twenty bucks says I can get through this door in twenty seconds.
So how did you know about her key? You been doing a little handyMan work for Cuddy yourself?,Someone as obsessive and insecure as Cuddy pRobably has three extra keys hidden within ten feet of the door.
"Oh, and you consider obsession a negative quality?","Insecticide is organic, soap is hypoallergenic."
"Insecticide is organic, soap is hypoallergenic.",I got the bedroom.
I got the bedroom.,This is where it all happens.
There's no way you deduced where that key was.,Does this count as red?
"You gave yourself twenty seconds, then put money on it.",Oh my God. She's got pictures of you in here.
Oh my God. She's got pictures of you in here.,Just you. It's like some kind of weird shrine.
It's like some kind of weird shrine. You're kidding.,Yeah.
You're kidding. Yeah.,She uses super tampons. What does that mean?
You two are just too nasty to each other not to have been!nasty.,"Hey, I can be a jerk to people I haven't slept with. I am that good."
There's nothing here. Are you ready to go or you got some more stuff you want to sniff?,Whoa. Check this out. It's fuzzy. It's black. It's alive.
Patient's lung function is declining rapidly. Levaquin's not working. He obviously doesn't have garden-variety pneumonia.,I'm glad you learned to take his impending death in stride.
Guess what he does have. Rats.,Scars on his hand!
Scars on his hand! Rat bites.,But he says they're from construction work so he won't have to admit he's got rats in the home. Catholics are right. Pride will kill you.
Rat bite fEver.,"Boogy, oggy, oogy."
It fits the symptoms perfectly.,It's certainly one possibility. What about the aspergillus fungus we found under the sink?
What about the aspergillus fungus we found under the sink? What sink?,You ought to clean your bathroom better.
You broke into my House?,"No, that would be wrong. I had a key."
Oh damn. You're right. The focal consolidation makes fungal pneumonia far more likely.,"You're right I'm right. On the bright side, it has the advantage of keeping you totally responsible."
Yeah. Your point being?,Going the dangerous and aggressive route didn't work last time. It's bound to work this time. Start him on the amphotericin.
He falls off your roof and you don't come to see him once? Bitch.,With a Patient.
Not according to the log.,It's three-fifteen.
How's Cuddy doing?,She's not acting like Cuddy. It's a pleasure.
"You know her. She has trouble with these situations, feels personally responsible.",Technical term is narcissism. You can't beliEve Everything is your fault unless you also beliEve you're all-powerful.
"sarcastic Wow, doesn't she sound messed up.",I don't beliEve I can fix Everything. I don't lie awake at night tormented by that fact.
"No, you lie awake tormented by",We were talking about Cuddy here.
We were talking about Cuddy here. She cares.,She enjoys feeling guilty.
"Lisacares. It's why she drives you nuts. 'Cause it's not just a puzzle to her. The Patients are actually real, their feeling actually relevant. And I'm telling her, she can't Even talk to him.","My God, it's contagious. You're feeling guilty, too."
I'm just saying take it easy on her. You owe her that.,Commercial's over.
So glad we talked.,"Snap, crackle, pop. Got some Rice Crispies in there?"
"That bad, huh?","You were here yesterday. I see from the chart that Dr. Foreman prescribed medicine, not a miracle. Got to give this stuff more than a day."
I didn't fill that Oreo's prescription.,"On the theory that you didn't trust him because he's black!well, I'm going to prescribe the same medicine. See if you fill it this time."
"I'm not buying into no racist drug, okay?","It's racist because it helps black people more than white people? Well, on behalf of my peeps, let me say, thanks for dying on principle for us."
"Look. My heart's red, your heart's red. And it don't make no sense to give us different drugs.","You know, I have found a difference. Admittedly, it's a limited sample, but it's my experience in the last ninety seconds that all black people are morons. Sorry, African-Americans."
I'll see another doctor.,Fine. Fine.
I'll see another doctor. Fine. Fine.,I'll give you the same medicine we give Republicans.
I think he's dying. Dying?,"Geez, it's the cops."
Muriendo? Mi hijo esta muriendo? Dying? My son is dying?,Guess she understands a little English.
Proof that my brilliant idea of giving him amphotericin is killing him.,That wasn't a complete waste of time. His reaction shows that you don't need to clean under your sink. It wasn't aspergilllus.
And blood cultures show he was negative for rat bite fEver.,There's still plenty of other cool pneumonias!
"No, his antigen is negative.","Well, that all sucks!"
DIC wouldn't cause a fEver this high.,See my lapdog agrees with me. How high?
"Two hours ago, it was one-oh-three. With acetaminophen.",What about on St. Alban's Day? Only temperature I'm interested in right now is his temperature right now.
"No te preocupes, descansa, yo voy a trabajar por ti esta noche. Don't worry, rest, I'll cover for you at night.",Open up.
"Te dije que no, y se acabo!I told you no! End of story!","Okay, let me clarify. Open up and keep it open."
"One night, and that's it... Okay.",Under your tongue.
Under your tongue.,You're using your left hand. Right one hurt?
"No, I feel better.",It really doesn't hurt? Or you just figure if you say no you'll get out of the hospital sooner?
Doesn't hurt. Feels good.,You don't smell too hot.
You don't smell too hot.,Your hand is starting to rot.
Your hand is starting to rot.,Why are we here?
We're talking about cutting off a kid's hand.,"Yes, we're talking about cutting it off, not subdividing it and putting in condos. It's not a legal issue."
Are you being intentionally dense?,Huh?
I've heard enough.,What? She says one word and you take her side. You should wait until she at least gives a medical reason. Otherwise I might take it personally.
All of his symptoms are caused by his underlying pRoblem and the medicine we gave him.,What underlying pRoblem? You have no idea what the underlying pRoblem is.
You're the diagnostician.,Fine. It's all my fault. Does that make you feel better?
His hand still has an arterial pulse.,His hand is a cesspool. And the crap is spreading.
You are being pretty aggressive about destroying a Man's livelihood.,Don't give a damn about his livelihood.
"He lose that hand, he loses his job. All of his jobs. He's not like us.",He can't work as a cripple?
"He loses his home, his kid brother drops out!",American dream destroyed.
"American dream destroyed. Very sad, very emotional. Not one medical fact in the whole pathetic tale. You've lost perspective, Cuddy. You've stopped looking at this as a doctor. You're acting like someone who shoved somebody off their roof. You want to make things right? Too bad. Nothing's Ever right.","I'm happy to report that we're now so in synch we're actually wearing each other's underwear. Chop, chop time."
Is this true?,"No, I'm lying. Stupid to do with her in the room, I guess."
This is a big decision.,We made it.
We should convene in a meeting of the ethics committee.,NO! throws hands up. Look. She is making a medical decision based on nEver wanting to feel regret. You're making a legal decision on wanting me to be wrong.
"Greg, you have a history of","You wanted superficial agreement. You wanted Everybody's asses covered. You got it. Now can I do the surgery? Pretty, pretty please?"
I gave one of my clinic Patients a follow up call. Your name came up.,I'm guessing an old black guy that thinks the CIA invented rap music to make your people want to kill each other.
He says you gave him the white folks' stuff. This is exactly why black people don't live as long.,This isn't about race. Unless annoying is a race. Is he not getting better?
He's fine so far. I'm calling him back in. I'm getting him on the right stuff.,"Oh, relax, Foreman. He already is."
"Oh, relax, Foreman. He already is.",I told him it was the white stuff. I gave him the black stuff.
He was right. You did exactly what white people do. You figure we don't need to know the truth or can't understand it. So you just lie to us.,It's just a white lie.
"Good one, Master.","Right, I'm a racist. Too bad that idiot will nEver know for the rest of his long, long life."
He needs a ventilator. And dialysis.,"I'm getting distracted by the multi-system organ failure. Pinkies are supposed to be pink, right? They're not called grayies."
But the organ failure is gonna kill him.,But the pinky is weirder!sits up What does it tell us?
Same thing the right hand told us before we cut it off. It's the same symptom.,But at a different time.
"Well, the lack of DIC would explain Everything if there were also a lack of anything to explain.",Endocarditis. His heart's infected.
Endocarditis. His heart's infected.,Little bacteria cauliflowers clinging to his bowels.
It's perfect. Except for the little fact that we're already tested for endocarditis and he was negative.,Which either means he is negative or what infection could cause pneumonia and culture negative for endocarditis? Prize value goes down with Every clue.
You're thinking psittacosis? Alfredo doesn't have any pet parrots.,Which are squawking. Give him doxycycline.
No! That will just make his clotting pRoblem worse.,I liked you better when you were coming up with wacky drugs for us to try.
"If you're wrong, he'll end up with no hands and no feet.","Technically, if I'm wrong, he'll end up dead. But I take your point. What's his night job?"
He cleans up at some fast food joint. Why? Do you think he got it from a Parkcken nugget?,Since when do fast food joints allow twelve-year-olds to mop floors?
Alfredo is twenty.,Really? Looks younger.
Where were you going to work tonight?,What job do you do on Saturday nights?
What are you doing?,Wake him up.
We just cut off his hand.,Yeah. We need to talk about it.
It's not happening.,Donde trabaja su hijo los sbados por la noche? Where does your son work on Saturday nights?
Why didn't you say you spoke Spanish?,"Well, because, she'd want to talk to me."
"Well, because, she'd want to talk to me.",Dgame! Tell me!
"No trabaja los sbados. Es la nica noche que descansa. He doesn't work on Saturdays, it's the only night he rests.",She says he doesn't work Saturday nights. Give me the talking juice.
The fact it doesn't fit your theory doesn't make it a lie.,"When she was out of the room, the kid brother insisted he was going to cover for Alfredo at work tonight."
"When she was out of the room, the kid brother insisted he was going to cover for Alfredo at work tonight.",Que hace Alfredo los sbados por la noche? What does Alfredo do on Saturday nights?
"Se divierte con sus amigos, va a bailar! He has fun with his friends, goes dancing..",Saturday nights he goes dancing. Either it's a lie or he's dancing with birds.
Saturday nights he goes dancing. Either it's a lie or he's dancing with birds.,A dnde? Where?
Yo no se! I don't know!,Give her the talking juice.
She doesn't know what you're talking about.,"Odds are, it's going to be close to his House. PRobably an abandoned wareHouse or factory. Take the Scooby gang and spread out."
What the hell are we looking for?,"Find somebody who looks like crap, tell him you want to place a bet."
"Find somebody who looks like crap, tell him you want to place a bet. Ah!",Sayonara!
Sayonara! It's Cuddy.,I already put him on the psittacosis meds. Soon as you left. You're welcome.
I already put him on the psittacosis meds. Soon as you left. You're welcome.,What do you think the record for one-handed juggling is?
You can yo-yo one-handed.,Good point.
I nEver figured it out at all.,Hello.
What do you want House?,"if you're wallowing in self loathing, I've got something that might help."
"if you're wallowing in self loathing, I've got something that might help.",We're getting sued.
We'll settle. He's got a stub where his hand used to be. We have insurance. Case seems pretty solid to me.,Ca-Parkng. The new American dream. Happy ending. Kid's gonna be just fine.
Ca-Parkng. The new American dream. Happy ending. Kid's gonna be just fine.,Cuddy.
Kid's gonna be just fine. Cuddy.,"Your guilt. It's perverse, and it makes you a crappy doctor. It also makes you okay at what you do."
You figure a perverted sense of guilt makes me a good boss?,Now would the world be a better place if people nEver felt guilty?
"House, I'm not nave. I realize","If you did, you nEver would have hired me."
"If you did, you nEver would have hired me.",You're not happy unless things are just right. Which means two things. You're a good boss. And you'll nEver be happy.
You're not happy unless things are just right. Which means two things. You're a good boss. And you'll nEver be happy.,"By the way, why does Everybody think you and I had sex? Think there could be something to it? I don't know."
Cuddy feels guilty about not diagnosing psittacosis.,Think so?
There's no way she could have.,No. No way she could have.
No. No way she could have.,It's raining.
"Sebastian? Sebastian, now leaning on the breakfast table, collapses taking the table with him. The board members run over. Call 911! Isn't someone here a doctor? Ironic close-up on Sebastian's face!and credits!",Selling subscriptions? I heard twenty and you get a new bike.
Dr. Sebastian Charles collapsed during a presentation at Stoia Tucker.,Really? Crushed under the weight of his own ego?
Wow. Is there nobody you admire?,"Well, there was this gal I met in 'Nam who could blow out a candle without using her"
He thinks it's TB. She hands him a chart.,Good thing he's not the syphilis expert.
He wants a second opinion.,Second to his own. Okay. Closes chart It's not TB.
What is it?,"Oh, you want specifics?"
"No. He died last month. Stupidly tried to share his meds with his cousin and they only had enough for one. House enters. Dr. House, I'm Sebastian Charles. He offers his hand, which House walks right by.",Patients aren't usually part of the diagnostic process.
"Every minute, four people die of TB.","writing on the board Wow, how can you sleep at night?"
There're people dying in Africa of a disease that we cured over,"Yeah, I know."
"No, thanks, I'll stay. I'd like to hear the differential.","Dr. Cameron, tell the doctor why it's not a good idea for the Patient to be here."
He's an immunologist and a TB expert.,"That'll be very useful if we need somebody to say the words, I think it's TB. He sniffs. What is that?"
"Oh that. I'm sorry, that's my body powder. It's the only thing I've found that works in the Sahara. I, I'm kind of used to it, I don't Even notice it.",Who thinks it smells like an elephant dung smoothie?
It smells okay to me. Sebastian laughs.,That is exactly why the Patient shouldn't be in the room.
He's not an idiot.,"Sure, you say that now, while he's in the room."
"Look, I don't have time for this. It's TB.",Nope. The symptoms are too varied.
"Well, if you haven't seen 10,000 cases I'd agree that's what you'd think.",Told you he's an idiot. You said you wanted a second opinion.
"No, actually. My backers wanted a second opinion.","Yeah, doesn't look good if you drop dead while wearing your shoes sponsor's logo."
"It's TB, and I'm not dying. I'm going to want you to plan a PPD and induce sputum to confirm the TB. House nods to Chase and Foreman, who stand up. Sebastian follows. Imaging studies will determine the progress, and I think we should pRobably take a CT-scan of my lungs just so that nobody second-guesses us?",Wouldn't want that. Sebastian's cell rings. He answers it.
smiling very broadly I should go.,"The nameless poor have a face, and it's a pompous white Man. Cameron enters."
What's the emergency?,"looking at his yo-yo I can't remember how to do Walk the Dog. The guy's sick, he may be dying. We've forgotten all about doing a differential diagnosis."
You just sent us off to test him for,I had to get him out of there. Now we can all sit around and call him an idiot. Who wants to go first?
He's right! Tuberculosis could present in hundreds of different ways!,"Well, by that logic, Everyone in the hospital should be treated."
Not Everyone in the hospital's been exposed to it for the last 20 years.,"TB takes years to kill you. Two weeks ago he was perfectly healthy, now he's got a white board full of symptoms."
What about something metabolic?,"Welcome aboard the Good Ship Asskisser. Chase glares. Nice day for a sail. Pucker up, me hearties."
What about his heart?,Obviously big as all out doors.
Abnormal heart rhythm. White form showed P-R variability.,"It's subtle, but it's there."
You think it's his heart? Sick sinus syndrome?,"Loose throttle. Sometimes beats too fast, sometimes too slow."
It would account for the episode. I'll put him on telemetry do a stress test and an echocardiogram.,"Treat him like Every other hospital Patient. I want to see that pious, body powered toosh hanging out of his gown."
Good for you. He chuckles as she wheels him out of the room.,"Every minute that we refuse to love one another, another puppy cries another tear."
You're just mad that he's closer to a Nobel Prize than you are.,"And yet I've nailed more Swedish babes. Crazy, crazy world."
"It's not just a trip to Stockholm, you know. It comes with a cash prize.","Seriously? No wonder Everyone's going after that peace thing. The elevator dings, and they walkout into the hospital lobby."
"He cures thousands of people Every year, you cure, what? 30?",McDonald's makes a better hamburger than your mother because they make more?
"Oh, I see! So you hate him because the lives he saves aren't as good as the lives you save.","Yup, that's the reason. Nobel invented dynamite. I won't accept his blood money."
The top of my head's killing me. She puts her hand on her head to demonstrate.,Hmmm.
Ow! That is not the top of my head!,"Eh, close enough for clinic. Your sinuses are clogged. Judging by the scratches on your hands, I'm guessing a new cat."
It was my mother's. She's dead.,You keep a dead cat?
No. My mother's dead.,"Oh. Poor cat. You're allergic. We can control it with antihistamine, one pill a day."
"We can control it with antihistamine, one pill a day. Pills?",You don't like to swallow. Not surprised. Forget the pills. I'll give you a nasal spray.
Steroids? Is there something else you can give me?,"Well, if you lived by the river, I've got a bag."
"Hey, stress test was normal.",But his EKG was not normal.
But his EKG was not normal. Echo's normal.,"Two for you, one for me. We need a tie-breaker."
Echo and stress test are more reliable.,Tilt-table test.
Tilt-table test. NEver works.,Bet you a week's clinic duty it does.
"Hah hah, you're on.",You like this guy? And up.
You always tell us our opinion of the Patient is irrelevant.,"Medically, it's irrelevant. Down. That says something about you. Up."
You figure that anybody that gives a crap about people in Africa must be full of it?,Yes.
"Hmmm. So, the great huManitarian's as selfish as the rest of us.",Just not as honest about it.
"You also always tell us motives are irrelevant. And Sebastian is still going up! Dr. Charles, your heart's handling the changes in orientation just fine. No pauses on your EKG. And House drives up for the lay-up and oh, rejected! Heh, those doctors and those sports metaphors.",What does this knobby thing do?
I'm within protocol range you're not going to get a different result.,"The way I figure it is, if this could show you pRoblems at 6, imagine what could happen if you crank it to10."
"House, is that you?",Does it go to 11?
"Okay, I'm getting dizzy, I can't see, I'm gonna pass out.",I win.
"At those speeds, astronauts throw up.",I'm not talking about the nausea. He points to the screen with the readout.
You were wrong.,"Hey, I have feelings. I'm trying my best. Isn't that enough for you?"
It's not sick sinus syndrome.,"Well, thank God we found out before we put the pacemaker in. And thank God you dragged him into a stairwell to get his heart racing."
Why would you say he's selfish?,Because he's been talking to Foreman. The phone rings.
"No I haven't, I'm just giving my opinion. This kind of altruism doesn't just naturally",Excellent briefing.
"Hey, the guy's still sick. Can we talk about that? The headaches point to a neurological pRoblem. Acoustic neuroma. Brian tumour causes dizziness, loss of consciousness, messes with breathing patterns, heart rhythms",Get an MRI.
"Yeah, there is.",Did I ask you to plant a PPD?
"It was positive, he's got TB!","Well, of course he's got TB! The guy's been in the jungle for 20 years! If he tested positive for pink-eye would you think that was his big pRoblem?"
"I did a test, it was positive, why is that a pRoblem?","Because now he's got the big red target on his arm, the stubborn jerk thinks he's right! He won't let us do any more tests."
"Well, maybe he's not the only stubborn jerk. House does an exaggerated what, me? kind of gesture. I did an LP2 low glucose and he has an increased sed rate. Everything screams tuberculosis!",Not Everything!
If any of the symptoms are caused by the TB it would throw off our diagnosis.,You're right. Got to treat the TB.
"Who knows, maybe he'll just get better.","You'd like that, wouldn't you? Cameron leaves."
"So it's TB, but not TB?",I'm compliCated.
The guy does know tuberculosis. If he says it can Manifest itself,"He's not Even a real doctor, he's a huMan telethon."
"Is that your pRoblem with him? You see hypocrites Every day, why is this guy so special?",You think I have a hypocritical attitude to hypocrisy?
So it's all because he's one of them useless specialists?,"Oh, did I hurt the big time oncologist's itty bitty feelings?"
You've outdone yourself.,I'll say. My salad's covering a free t-bone steak.
"Cecelia Carter, remember her?","Last week they said it was Mystery Stew, they owe me."
That doesn't sound like you!,Then it pRobably wasn't.
"I get that you like to shock people. Stun them out of complacency, out of stupidity. But this Woman thought she had cancer, she had a lump in her breast! What were you trying to accomplish?","Let me ask you something if this were another doctor, if this Patient were complaining about, let's say, I don't know, Foreman, you'd just dismiss this as the paranoid bitParkng"
"Let me ask you something if this were another doctor, if this Patient were complaining about, let's say, I don't know, Foreman, you'd just dismiss this as the paranoid bitParkng of another paranoid bitch and file it under 'P' for Paranoid?",Am not.
Am not. You're right.,Good.
What did you do to Ceci?,"I have no idea. to the cashier Just a salad today, big breakfast."
He figures the pharmaceuticals need something big to force them into action. This'll get a lot more media play than a thousand African villagers dying. The phone rings. Chase checks the caller ID it's Newsweek!,So he won't take the pills.
Newsweek's calling you!,And he won't agree to any more tests.
He has his diagnosis.,See what happens when you don't listen to me?
Maybe millions of lives get saved,"Yeah, that's my point. Increased heart rate, night sweats, loss of consciousness! besides rough sex, what do they all have in common?"
"besides rough sex, what do they all have in common? T",It's not TB!
"Fabry's, autonomic disregulation syndrome, shy-drager syndrome, it doesn't matter. He won't let us test him. The phone begins to ring again. House picks up.","on phone In my opinion, Dr. Sebastian Charles is an idiot. Yeah, you can quote me. C-u-d-d-y. Chase and Foreman laugh to themselves."
"on phone In my opinion, Dr. Sebastian Charles is an idiot. Yeah, you can quote me. C-u-d-d-y. Chase and Foreman laugh to themselves.",Sebastian is refusing life-saving treatment.
"He's refusing TB treatment. You don't think he has TB, ergo you should care less.",He won't let me test him.
And what do you want me to do about it?,Hold him down.
Have you apologized to Cecelia Carter yet?,Trust me she doesn't want to hear it from me.
Sebastian has called a press conference for 3. He's asked me to be there to confirm the diagnosis and the prognosis.,You are as big a media whore as he is.
Of course I am. It couldn't possibly be that I think he's right and I'd like to be a small part of what he's doing.,"Oh, whores can like the sex. Doesn't mean they're not whores. And with that eye shadow! I am totally screwed, aren't I?"
takes Cameron's handThank you. House notices the cozy scene and decides to intervene.,"You want third-world treatment? turns up the thermostat You got it. Boy, is it hot here in Jani!"
What are you doing?,What am I doing?
You think he's a hypocrite?,unplugging the TV Hypocrite?
"Do you really think that if you come in here and make it a little hot, make it smell a little, that I'm just going to fold and abandon Everything that matters to me?","wiping his cane on Sebastian's blanket Lousy sanitation over there, too."
"I am the same, I'm not special.",You can't deMand to be treated like any third-world sick person and call a press conference!
"on TV No, I have no intention of martyring myself, I'm just putting myself!","keeps snapping Sure, they're dying, but it's got a great beat."
Must be hot as hell under those lights.,Yup. Foreman enters.
"Hey, why the page? He okay?","He's in a coma. I need you to apologize to Ceci, Cecily!"
Mrs. Carter? For what?,For whatEver I did.
You didn't do anything.,That has been my position all along.
"on TV X-rays are negative, so he's not contagious at this point, his condition's currently stable","Do you notice how all the self-sacrificing women in history Joan of Arc, Mother Theresa, can't think of any others they all die alone."
"House, she was scared and unreasonable.","Insulting a Woman with breast cancer that's a move best left to the pros. Frankly, you don't have the chops."
"I didn't insult her! I did the unnecessary biopsy, like she wanted. House moves to change the tint on the TV. It was negative, like I knew it would be.","What did you do, call 'em perky? You are years away from mad skills Ed. m4d sk1llz? like that. I need you to apologize."
"You know, Cuddy's only doing this because she thinks it's you.","Welcome to the world. Everyone's different, Everyone gets treated different. You try fighting that, you end up dying of TB. House hits the TV."
What are you doing?,Testing the Patient's autonomic nervous system.
Testing the Patient's autonomic nervous system. Of course.,"His internal heating and ventilation should be off, shouldn't be able to sweat."
"Dr. House, I would appreciate it if you left the room.",He's sweating like a pig.
"Did they hear me? The media, did they listen?",He's disoriented.
"They, they have to hear me.",His arteries are clamping down. A monitor starts beeping.
"I want Everybody out of here, now!","Get the crash cart, he's having a cardiac arrest! More beeping."
I've got sinus rhythm.,in the camera's face That is not TB!
Do whatEver tests you want.,I want to treat you for TB. Dr. Cameron found low sugar in your cerebrospinal fluid. It's a classic finding of TB.
And now you think TB's the pRoblem?,"Nah. If TB caused cardiac arrest on a hot day, your work in Africa would be Even more futile than it already is."
"Can you get to your point, please?","That white board in my office, we're up to about a dozen symptoms now."
I'll take any other tests or treatments you might want to prescribe.,"So you're not special, but TB is."
"People die of TB because we let them, it's our choice.","People die of malaria because we let them, they die of dysentery"
"Nah, TB's my disease.","You own a disease? Well, I'm sorry I missed the IPO on dengue fEver."
"Look, I know I have a way about me. I know I piss a lot of people off, and a whole lot more I just annoy. But you're the first person that I've Ever met who I think is actually annoyed by what I do. Do you think I'm not saving any lives, or is that a bad thing?","Right now, I'm just trying to save your life."
"Or do you just have a pRoblem with hope? House rolls his eyes. You know, the difference between our jobs is not numbers or styles. It's that I know I'm going to fail. Even if I save a million people there's going to be another million. You couldn't handle that. I think you resent anyone who can.",Can't we just agree that you're incredibly annoying?
Why would you do that?,"Because I'm just a mean son of a bitch. House leaves, and Sebastian takes the pills."
"Because I'm just a mean son of a bitch. House leaves, and Sebastian takes the pills.","So we still have to explain P-R variability, syncope, headaches, and! low sugar?"
You've rerun the test? Yeah.,This is good!
Good? This is bizarre.,Bizarre is good! Common has hundreds of explanations. Bizarre has hardly any.
What else could cause low CSF sugar?,Uh-uh. I get to ask the questions. I've found you look a lot smarter asking the questions than dumbly not answering.
"How could he get high insulin lEvels? We've checked daily blood sugars, all normal!",See how smart she looks? Cause she asked the question.
"And it's not glucagonoma because he has no rash. It's not self-induced because he's not an idiot, and it's not a tumour because the CT and the MRI were both negative.","Which just leaves the tumour. He leaves, they all follow."
Why do you do this? Why do you ignore what I say like I'm not Even,"Small tumour. Really, really tiny. So small we can't see it. Nesidioblastoma."
It only intermittently secretes insulin.,"It responds to stress. Like if, oh, I don't know, if someone accidentally puts the mechanical bull on11. They pile into the elevator. Easily removed by surgery."
"Except, if it's so small we can't see it, how're we Even going to prove it's there?","She asked, looking clEver."
We just start hacking away at his pancreas until he gets better?,How do you prove something exists when you can't see it? Does God exist? Does the wind blow?
We know because the leaves move.,"Look for effects. They get out of the elevator, where Cuddy and Cecelia are moving toward them."
"Uh, we should look the other way. It's Cuddy with your Patient.",Dr. House has an emergency.
We can't avoid her forEver.,Eventually she'll die. You sure she doesn't have breast cancer?
Eventually she'll die. You sure she doesn't have breast cancer?,"We think you have a tumour, easily removed surgically. We're going to poke it with a stick."
And if there's no tumour?,"Nothing happens. Splenic artery, it's a hard left off the celiac. Chase goes for the artery."
If there is a tumor?,What usually happens when you poke something with a stick? It pokes back.
He's stuck in the superior mesenteric.,I knew we should have stopped for directions. Men.
Men. I'm there.,We're going to inject calcium into your pancreas.
How do we know it won't go too low?,Fingers and toes crossed.to Chase Go ahead. Chase injects the calcium. CGI shot of it entering the artery.
Glucose is holding steady at 75.,No leaves rustling. Blow harder.
I already gave him 1 amp.,"Well, I guess now would be the time to give him more than 1 amp. CGI of more calcium entering."
I'm going to start him on a glucose drip. He's going to seize,Not yet.
He's continuing to drop.,Not fast enough. Monitor beeps.
"He's at 40, 38, 35!Monitor gets to 30, before --","Push an amp of D-50, you want to kill the guy? CGI of the meds entering the system."
We're back to 40.,"Congratulations, you have a tumor."
"Congratulations, you have a tumor.",Are you going to go out with him?
Is that any of your business?,Nope.
I don't think so.,Two days ago you were holding his hand. What's changed?
"He practically lives in Africa, there's no future.","On the other hand, maybe there's too much of a future now."
Right. It's that simple.,That was simple?
I put a label on them and go from there.,Everybody does it. We are who people think we are. People think he's a great doctor so they give him stuff.
He is a great doctor.,The reality is irrelevant.
"He enters the clinic, and walks by Cecelia, deliberately leaning his cane on her boot. Ow!","Oh, my goodness, are you okay?"
Yeah. Cuddy comes to her door.,"exaggerated, toward CuddyI am so sorry. It was completely my fault."
"It's nothing, I'm fine.","Well, I'm very reliEved, I feel terrible."
"Don't worry about it, I'm fine.","You sure? Okay. They shake hands. Cuddy and House make faces at each other. As House leaves, Cuddy walks through her office door to Cecelia."
"Thank you, thank you, I appreciate that. I appreciate the support.","It's not about the kids dying Every 8 seconds, it's about the media stroking. Adulation and pats on the head."
"That's your pRoblem with him, isn't it?","Look at him, he loves it. Eats it up."
"Yeah, the Man actually enjoys what he does. Pointed look.","Listen, I saved his life. That means I get credit for Every life he saves from here on out."
"No, MRI showed no white matter lesions, and the shocks aren't accompanied by neck flexing.",Good morning!
It's almost noon.,Really? That must be why I'm so hungry. Who's up for lunch?
What's with the jacket?,"poses It keeps me warm, and cool. How does it know?"
We're discussing your new Patient.,"Must be a boring discussion, considering that I haven't accepted a new Patient."
You accepted him the moment I loaned you five grand.,"Oh, wait, wait, when I said I'd do anything for the money, obviously I didn't mean it."
"Bad night at poker, or great night with a hooker?",Thank you for saving me the trouble of deflecting that personal question with a joke.
"Been there done that, also ruled out cancer, MS, pyridoxine toxicity, and all the popular neuropathies.",sighs Cervical spondylosis?
Doesn't explain the low white count.,"He's black, I'm assuming he's not just really dirty, but is of African descent. Which means he'd have a lower white count."
Not this low.,"He's a wrestler, pRobably uses diuretics to cut weight, can also cause low white count."
Not this low.,Mockingly Not this low. Tieshets??.
No external outbreak.,Something's missing. Find out what it is. Tosses the chart on the table in front of the ducklings.
"Uh, I don't Even know what that means.","Well figure it out, find it out, and then find me, I'll be at lunch."
"Well this, this is perfect.","Invite me to dinner Thursday night. Wilson looks blankly at him Come on we haven't had a nice meal together since, oh!"
Yesterday when I loaned you five thousand dollars to buy a new car. Points at the bike,"tosses his cane up in the air and catches it near the top, then hands it over to Wilson My treat. House limps over to the bike"
"Two-wheeled vehicles that travel 150 miles an hour don't really go well with crippled, irresponsible, drug addicts.",Actually two-wheeled vehicles that go 180 miles an hour do not go well with healthy responsible arParktects who don't know how to separate breaking and turning.
You're taking it back.,Mock whining Moooom! How about we talk about this over dinner.
"Forget dinner, you're going to kill yourself! Nice bike!","Thank you. See that's how you do it, compliments, dinner."
What do you do with your cane?,"If he buys me dinner, he'll find out."
"We went though all the imaging studies, and re-did blood cultures.",I don't want hand-me-downs. I want brand new stuff.
Well there's nothing House revs the engine louder There's nothing!House revs the engine again.,Sorry I didn't catch that last part!
"There's nothing Engine revs again, Foreman gives up and stops speaking and House stops revving the engine. Everyone including Wilson starts to smile, Foreman tries again There's nothing else we can do.",You checked the police report?
You checked the police report? On what?,On his mom's car accident.
"It was 15 years ago, the kid wasn't Even in the car",She veered off a straight dry road in broad daylight. That doesn't seem odd to you?
She pRobably got distracted changing radio stations or something.,"That's what the police thought. Of course, they didn't know that she has a family member who is frequently incapacitated by shock-like sensations"
Genetic component seems unlikely,It's interesting. Type 2 neurofibromatosis could cause the shocks.
You knew this was missing?,"shrugs I knew something was missing. Maybe this, maybe something else. Get a DNA analysis of the long arm of chromosome 22"
"shrugs I knew something was missing. Maybe this, maybe something else. Get a DNA analysis of the long arm of chromosome 22",You'd rather have dinner with your wife?
"Yes, I would. If she were speaking to me.","smiles Unlike her, I could make it worth your while leers"
"smiles Unlike her, I could make it worth your while leers Fine.",Should I drive?
Not if you had the stool sample which was negative for botulinism.,He lied to his son about how his mom died? takes a Vicodin
He was just protecting him,Manipulating him.
It's what parents do.,They lie to us because they love us. Who's getting teary?
"Mom's death is irrelevant. DNA rEvealed no NF2 markers or any other inherited disease. Apparently, she really did fall asleep at the wheel.","SO, what exactly are we talking about here? A little peeker, or did the prairie dog actually come out to play?"
"A little peeker, or did the prairie dog actually come out to play? Excuse me?",Are we talking explosive?
"The haemacel was negative for blood, and I wouldn't say he actually exploded. More like... gushed?","Good, now we're getting somewhere checks the caller ID"
"Good, now we're getting somewhere checks the caller ID Yeah? Where?",I have no idea picks up the phone Hello?
Of course! The riddles.,Hi mom!
Who was that?,"Angelina Jolie. I call her mom. Who thinks that's sexy? turns back to the whiteboard So, explosive or gushing..."
"She nEver calls you, is Everything okay?","Great, yeah. My dad's taking her to Europe, they got a nine-hour layover in Newark on Thursday. If it's gastrointestinal..."
You lied to avoid seeing your own mom.,Are you kidding?
"Transverse myelitis. Could cause numbness, anal sphincter dysfunction, and the shocks.","Thank you for taking no interest in my mother. But that begs the question, what caused the transverse myelitis?"
Maybe the infection's gone but the memory remains,"Molecular mimicry. Nice. Okay, get an immunoglobulin lEvel and an electrophoresis"
"Molecular mimicry. Nice. Okay, get an immunoglobulin lEvel and an electrophoresis","talking to the symptoms on the whiteboard You're good my friend, I'm sure we'll meet again."
"Yeah, I know. It's not that it's...",Are these people completely incapable of telling the truth to each other?
He went to Jamaica with his friends.,sighs No wonder he lied. Parkldren aren't supposed to have good times.
"One of his friends flew them down. Carnell's dad has this thing about him accepting stuff from rich friends. Wants him to remember who he is, where he came from.",Where have you been?
Making dinner plans. What's up?,The boys have uncovered the shocking fact that the Patient has a crappy relationship with his dad.
They seem to actually care,Well I don't. There's only one reason any kid with a plane flies to Jamaica.
It wasn't for marijuana. He doesn't do anything but drink,He say that to you or his pops?
Tox screen was negative for THC,"thoughtful Spring break was over a month ago, Even pot would have washed out by now"
"Even if he'd smoked, no way marijuana causes transverse myelitis",True. But the stuff they put on it does.
Well you wouldn't necessarily have to smoke to get pesticide poisoning. He could have eaten fruit that had been sprayed or been exposed to his skin on a hike.,Or he could have smoked it.
You have no evidence to support a poisoning diagnosis.,Which is why it's going to be so cool when I turn out to be right.
Which is why it's going to be so cool when I turn out to be right.,"Cameron, who were you making dinner plans with?"
looking very innocent No one. House doesn't look convinced,You bastard! Wilson turns around and sees House You invited my parents to dinner.
Geez Cameron's got a big mouth!,Hah! Not as big as yours!
Hey! You used me to avoid seeing your parents.,Well what do you care?
"I don't, I just thought it might be interesting to find out why.",You could have just asked.
You would have lied!,And you would have beliEved me! Which would have kept us both happy. Wilson looks utterly confused You want your money back? Is this what this is about?
If you have the money then why did you need the loan?,I didn't.
dumbfounded You're splutters you're trying to... objectively measure how much I value our friendship?!,"Hey, it's 5 grand."
"takes the cheque and puts it in his wallet Fine. Thanks. Now, be a grown-up and either tell mommy and daddy you don't want to see them, or I'm picking you up at 7 for dinner gets into his car",shocked What do you mean? You just said that--
laughing He's got his appetite back! WhatEver you did is working.,"He's healthy, so all is forgiven. Now I'm feeling nauseous."
looking at Carnell's files He is not healthy. Nausea and diarrhoea were not his only symptoms!,The shocks have also decreased
But not disappeared.,"And he's out of the diaper, which is good news for Everyone."
What about his low white count?,The little buggers need time to grow.
puts down the phone What happened?,Apparently I can save money by switParkng to another long-distance carrier.
"Oh I was right, wasn't I?","Oh yeah, it's always about you isn't it?"
What's that mean? I mean... what's happening?,You want the truth? Or you want me to make something up to protect you? We think a drunk driver broke into his room.
angry What's happening to my son!,The truth is... I have no idea.
The truth is... I have no idea.,There's the fEver that Cameron was looking for
We knew if it was myelitis there had to be an itis. This must be the infection that set it off.,"Yeah, except in this universe, effect follows cause. I've complained about it, but--"
Maybe the tests were wrong,"No, the tests were right. Yesterday he had no fEver, no infection."
So he just happened to catch a bug while he was here? That's all this is?,"Yeah. Because his white blood cell count was down he was vulnerable, because it's really down it might kill him. That's ALL this is. Is he still pooping his pants?"
He just started again.,Again?
It stopped when he was getting better.,"He was feeling better, he was nEver getting better."
And we need to find an answer before this infection kills him.,That would be the ideal.
What do you want?,To apologise.
The clinic's closed at night,"Yeah but I'm sure there's plenty of things to be done, there's charts to be reviewed, supplies inventoried--"
"Yeah but I'm sure there's plenty of things to be done, there's charts to be reviewed, supplies inventoried-- Dinners avoided?",You're going too?
I love their Cobb salad.,"Give me a reason to get out of this, and I'll tell you who started the rumour about you being a transsexual."
There is no such rumour.,"There will be, unless you get me out of this dinner."
"No one's making you do this, House, just do what Everybody else does, lie to them.",You lie to your mother?
Only since I was twelve!,"My mom's a huMan polygraph. My dad should be taking her to Vegas, not the Louvre."
"Trust me, your mom would much rather think you have a business meeting than you hate her.",I don't hate her. I hate him.
"I don't know. I took some scrapings, it doesn't appear to be ringworm.",What did it look like? Aside from not ringworm.
Any discolouration around the edges?,"Get him in here, we all want to take a look."
Even if it is Kaposi's it's not related. Our Patient doesn't have any skin symptoms and we've already ruled out cancer.,"What are the odds of two friends who've just returned from a trip outside the country coming down with unexplained, but unrelated illnesses? Get him in here."
"He won't come. Just started a new job after graduation, they're working on some big merger.",Tell him his friend's life hangs in the balance.
That's what I told him the first time. Still wound up driving into Manhattan.,Tell him his life hangs in the balance. Tell him the rash is flesh-eating and the next course in the menu is his frank and beans.
But it means the antibiotics aren't working.,Double the dose. And add tygacil to the list.
Soon as he's out of surgery.,Where's RiParke Rich?
He said he can't leave work.,"Yeah, you told me that two hours ago."
I'm not going to lie.,"Why, 'cause it's wrong? Or because you're a coward?"
"Hmm, tough choice.",You've been wasting 2 hours of the kid's time.
"Yeah, by vomiting blood. Ambulance is 10 minutes out.",You Taddy?
You Taddy? What?,Love the name. If I Ever have a dog... take off his pants.
to Cameron Hey.,"Don't talk to her, listen to me"
"He's vomited in excess of 3 units of blood, he needs to be admitted before--","You wanted to be a doctor, maybe you should have buckled down a little more in high school takes a pair of scissors and starts cutting up Taddy's pants"
What are you doing?,Exactly how close were you and Carnell?
Not so close.,Spend a lot of time together in Jamaica? Share a room?
"Wait, you don't think... look, we're not gay.","Not saying you're gay, I'm saying you had sex. tears the pants open and starts inspecting the rash near Taddy's groin. Fortunately, Taddy's still got his briefs on"
"Look we're not gay, we hardly Even hung out.","Right, so you just flew him down to Jamaica because he won a contest."
"No he's in my frat, all right? Between school and wrestling, and going home Every break to work in his father's junkyard, Carnell didn't have any time to hang out with anybody.",It's not fungus.
I already told you that.,"There's no pustules, it's not Staph... suddenly looks up at Taddy His dad's what?"
His dad owns a scrap metal salvage yard. Carnell worked there during breaks.,You lied.
What are you talking about?,"Oh, yeah, pRoblems with this family, pRobably need more specifics. You told us you owned a construction company, not a salvage yard."
"I know the way things work, the better my job, the better my son gets treated.",Right. That's why I'm mad. 'Cause we wasted all that filet mignon on you. Did your kid find anything unusual the last time he worked for you?
Did your kid find anything unusual the last time he worked for you? No.,"Braided wire, metal weights, lead canister, maybe just a lid. PRobably used it as a door stop or paperweight."
"Why would he want to-- stops mid sentence, long pause","Okay, here it comes"
"I gave him an early graduation gift, old plumb I found. Looks like a fishing weight. Put it on a keychain so he'd always remember where he came from.",So he can lie about it later. Where's the keychain?
"I don't know. He nEver used it, just kept it as a good luck charm.",Kept it where?
I don't know! Why? Why does it matter?,Where are the kid's clothes?
In the bureau back in his regular room?,gestures at Chase and Foreman You two get it to radiology.
gestures at Chase and Foreman You two get it to radiology. His clothes?,"The bureau. Don't open it. they rush off, he turns to Cameron You come with me."
"The bureau. Don't open it. they rush off, he turns to Cameron You come with me.","Set it down there. Now get out of here, this thing is radioactive. he takes a Geiger counter out of the small box and turns it on. Chase runs out"
The chances of radiation causing CNS symptoms? Whoa.,Call the boys in the lead pyjamas. Foreman runs out
"It might not have caused nerve damage, but it definitely destroyed his immune system.",And caused tumours.
We don't know that. None of the MRIs showed anything.,Do a PET scan. Check his cervical spine. It's not going to be good news.
But he can't. He needs to be in a sterile isolation room to prEvent further infections.,Mom.
Mom. We're early.,gets up and hugs her It's great to see you.
"We came at a bad time, didn't we?","Actually, yeah. I uh... I have to take a rain check."
"Aww, plans have been made. Wilson made 'em.","I asked him to cancel. I'm dealing with kind of a compliCated case right now, so..."
"Well, we'll just come back when things aren't so out of control.",My team is busy.
You don't want to see us?,"Mom, don't make me feel guilty."
"No no, of course not! Sorry.",I've got a Patient who's pRobably going to die of radiation poisoning.
I'll buy you a ruben.,Well I guess I've got time for a sandwich.
Well I guess I've got time for a sandwich. smiles Good!,Yeah?
I just wanted to let you know that Carnell's prepped for surgery.,Thank you.
"Really? New, huh?",Nope. Just gullible.
"So, besides work, what you been up to?",Not much.
You always say that. Not much.,It's always the answer.
"Leave him alone, John.","Got a new motorcycle. Might have seen it out front, it's orange with a gigantic scrape."
Is it the one in the handicap Parking?,"Yeah. Looks like crap, but it drives great."
"Last I checked, you still have two legs.","Actually, three holds up his cane"
"doesn't look amused You know what your pRoblem is, Greg?",Shifting gears?
Where's the head?,"turns to his mother Well, good thing we got that cleared up"
Oh he was just trying to help.,I don't need help.
The father and the friend are responding well to treatment. Things aren't looking so good for Carnell.,sprawled out on an arm chair and one leg on a foot rest Thank you.
It was none of my business.,nods They seem perfectly pleasant don't they?
"Honey, you're wheezing!",Yeah!
We need to talk.,Oh god. Are you pregnant? 'Cause I really want to finish high school
You have to renew your credentials!,They're good for two more months
"Three weeks. The paperwork takes forEver. Your application, your malpractice insurance, criminal records check - you know that's going to take some explaining",You know our relationship was way better when we were sleeping together. Why'd we stop doing that? Did you get married?
Yeah! Otherwise I'd be on you like red on rice,Rice isn't r Oh I get it!
You're also behind on your dictations,"I don't do dictations. Cameron does them, or somebody."

"House, got a Patient","sighs Sorry, can't play anymore, my mom's calling me walks out of his office"

"Yeah I'll get right on that deadpan. Jeff Forster, respiratory arrest at 30 miles per hour.",She's loading me up with pointless paperwork
Didn't know you were behind on your pointless paperwork. O2 stats are in the--,She's hostile.
"ER checked for lung infiltrates, nothing there","Professional athletes, Cuddy!"

"Jeff Forster, this is Dr--","I'm a doctor, you're a sick person. Looks at the Manager And you are a loved one"
"Actually, Manager. We've been together for sEven years sticks her hand out to shake House's. House looks away and ignores the gesture",So what's the drug du jour on the bike circuit these days? Still erythropoietin? Or are you guys just chugging battery acid?

Assuming I'm more ethical than your client.,"So, injecting yourself with donor red blood cells for fun and profit. Any other tricks up your sleEve?"
"Well, nothing much recently. I'm in town for a charity ride so it didn't matter if I won. The kids just needed to see me.",So you go slower they see you longer. Let's say that our health could be affected by things we did before last Friday.
"Well... umm, I usually sleep in a hyperbaric chAmber. I've been pumping up electrolytes with an IV drip and herbal supplements, amphetamines, and diuretics","Yeah yeah yeah yeah, but why would you be sick?"
Dr House is a firm beliEver in good old-fashioned hard work.,"This guy doesn't Even get sick like a regular person. Instead of a list of symptoms and no cause, we have a list of possible causes for one symptom"
Is the symptom death?,"Respiratory distress. And insanity doesn't cause it, I looked it up."
"It's the doping. Injecting extra red cells boosts your endurance lEvel, but it also thickens your blood. Thick blood equals clots equals respiratory distress",Not with a clean spiral chest CT
Guy's sleeping in a hyperbaric chAmber. Over-oxygenation can cause cell damage and if the cells in the lungs are damaged--,That'd cause pulmonary oedema which he doesn't have
Supplements he's been taking contain yojimbo which can cause nerve paralysis,"Tox screen was normal. All the tests were normal. There's no clot, no oedema, and yet he still can't breathe, so there's something in here that we can't see."
"There's no clot, no oedema, and yet he still can't breathe, so there's something in here that we can't see. Oh! Air.",Come to papa!
This guy's been injecting himself how Many times a day? All it'd take is one slip of the needle to cause an air embolus.,"The air is keeping him from breathing air. Let's go with that for the irony. Get a VQ scan, check his veins for bubbles."
You were right.,Now there were 3 wasted words.
There is a bubble in his lung. We should do a Swan-Ganz catheterisation.,"I love when you do both sides of the conversation. It's like white noise, it's very peaceful."
Is there a light somewhere that goes on when I have food?,"Green for food, orange for bEverages, red for impure thoughts. That bulb burns out Every 2 weeks."

"Er, Mark is in group therapy for people coping with disability. He was thinking about dEveloping a drug addiction but that would be stupid.",Hey! Your stutters a little in exaggerated excitement you again!
Not going to make some joke about Mark being in therapy?,What's there to say? It's only the responsible thing. I'm sure he's got a lot to deal with
You all right? Jeff! Can you swallow?,"What makes a guy start drooling? Chase, were you wearing your short shorts?"
Muscle fatigue in his neck and jaw. He's obviously got something worse than an air embolus.,Why?
Because... you don't drool from your lungs?,"Maybe the pRoblem is not the embolus itself. Maybe it's the treatment. Maybe you hit a nerve, literally."
He's too old for that,"So what would be just right, Goldilocks?"
"interrupting Yeah, right on schedule. So, when am I going to be done? I need to know 'cause I got plans to make. When can I safely book a game of squash? When am I going to stop being angry?",Not today.
You know House! You know we have a history!,You've been telling me for years that I should come by. Here I am. to the group Hi guys
Got a Thursday group.,Poker night.
Poker night. Monday morning?,"Book club. Well look, if it's a pRoblem, I'll just go deal with my rage privately."
"Wait. If you two could resolve this tension, you could really help each other.",nods thoughtfully I'm tired of fighting.
laughs What? So either I say yes or I'm the jerk?,"Oh god, I know that feeling."
At least you can still get around on your own.,"Yeah I know, but you're starting to walk. You're going to get better."
"You have a job, a way to be productive.","You have a wife, which gives greater meaning. Wife could make things harder too I suppose."
This isn't about Stacy.,"When it happened to me, Stacy was great. She kept telling me not to rush it. I nEver beliEved her."
She means it.,"I know, but..."
laughs softly as he finally realises what House is up to How the hell could she have loved a Manipulative son of a bitch like you?,That's an interesting question. Maybe she was attracted to different things in the two of us.
She left you.,But why was she with me to begin with?
She made a mistake!,"Maybe it's that simple. Or maybe she saw something in me, something that she doesn't get from you."
I'm not an ass!,Maybe she wanted an ass. She obviously did once.
"Either he goes, or I go!",You think that's the kind of thing you can just turn off?
"Dr House, cancel your book group. You're coming on Mondays.","Here's my new theory. The drooling is another competitive edge. Nobody can drive behind him, the road gets slick, he's the only one not racing in the rain!"
He can barely move his arms or legs.,sighs Paralysis?
"Jeff doesn't want normal, he wants superpowers.",So why is he normal?
"Oh god, you too?","He's shooting for extraordinary, so why is Everything so ordinary?"
Maybe his count is raised maybe what's normal for us is out of whack for him.,Can't slip anything by you.
That's kind of a long shot.,"Yeah, but it's been over an hour since we poked the Patient with something sharp so, get a lumbar puncture. And order broad spectrum antibiotics."
Apparently not they proceed to intubate Jeff,"So glad we cured his respiratory arrest, freed him up to dEvelop respiratory arrest."
"The white count is still the same, but the red count's fallen to 29 percent.",What was my theory yesterday?
I didn't screw up--,"Why would you be so petty, Chase?"
"Either he's losing blood because you nicked something, or he's just not producing blood in which case we're talking acute anaemia combined with a muscular disorder. Paraneoplastic syndrome?","Either you screwed up, or he's got cancer."
I think I should start smoking again.,You want a medical opinion supporting that decision?
The symptoms started as soon as I quit.,Symptoms meaning flips open the chart diarrhoea. A lot of diarrhoea.
"Ten or twelve times a day, it's really embarrassing. I'm a flight attendant, and...","Well, if you're upset, my hiccups are gone."
You went to his group.,"Well you were the one who was all 'Greg, you need to confront your feelings'."
hits House across the arm again that was 5 years ago.,I've been pissy.
"Fine, you don't want help does that mean nobody should get it?",Mark's looking for help because... what? He's resentful? Overwhelmed? I'm asking because I care.
"Not about him, you still want to jump me so you don't care who's married--","Look, I could get my rocks off anytime I want. What I don't seem to be able to do is my job without you hanging over my shoulder."
"Look, I could get my rocks off anytime I want. What I don't seem to be able to do is my job without you hanging over my shoulder.",How Many packs? Turns back to the Patient
A bit over one a day but they were lights and I quit. Pause You used to go out with her?,Yeah. What was I thinking? I'm talking about the gum you're chewing you Ever play smoking as an oral fixation. How Many packs?
I'm trying to protect you. Cuddy and I may be the only people stopping you from jumping off a cliff just to prove that you--,You're pissy.
Oh I am angry!,Pissy. You only get pissy when you're frustrated.
You only get pissy when you're frustrated. Shut up!,"Ok, I'm wrong."
"This is unbelievably difficult for Mark, which you should know, which you should be able to summon up some lEvel of empathy for.",Right. The cripple boys. We should start a band.
"I have a good thing with Mark, we are handling this the best way we know how.",And none of this has anything to do with me?
"No, nothing! Except that you can't, or won't just let it go! Let it go. Walks back out slamming the door",You're being poisoned.
You're being poisoned. By gum?,Sugarless gum uses sorbitol as a sweetener. We use sorbitol as a laxative.
"Well, he's negative for bleeds.","Congratulations, Chase. It's cancer. Clean him up and let Oncology have him, it's their party now."
Unless it's drug-induced. He's lying about not being on EPO?,Why would he lie?
What does it matter?,"People lie for thousands of reasons, but there's always a reason."
"Philosophically interesting, medically irrelevant.",Unless he's not lying.
"I assume if I point out the fact that you have no right to do that, you'll interpret that as a sign of guilt?",Wilson's chatty. Plus he's got two ex-wives to support. You want me to tell him he's fired?
"Until we figure out who's behind this, I'm sitting in with you guys. You have the ethics of a four-year-old I'm going to treat you like one.",How am I supposed to practice medicine with a Lawyer sitting on my shoulder?
How am I supposed to practice medicine with a Lawyer sitting on my shoulder? Responsibly.,You know I can't do that!
Somebody once told me that Everybody lies. Since you're the only people who know he has cancer--,He doesn't have cancer.
"The point is, you're his medical team. He's threatening to sue.",Why would Cameron leak cancer? How does cancer make the guy look bad? Lengthy pause He's on EPO. Rushes out
Why would Cameron leak cancer? How does cancer make the guy look bad? Lengthy pause He's on EPO. Rushes out,"Your anaemia is caused by pure red cell aplasia. This is going to hurt, but we got to talk."
What the hell are you doing?!,He'll be fine.
He doesn't have cancer?,"That's the good news. Bad news is, pants are on fire. Acute PRCA is caused by drugs, most commonly, EPO. Ready, and... action! he pulls the gas mask off"
I haven't used EPO.,"puts the gas mask back on Ok, this time, more anger! Remember, this guy's accusing you of cheating. Takes the gas mask off again"
I haven't used that stuff.,"Oh kisses his fingertips mwah, I beliEved it."
Snatches the mask out of House's hands and gives it back to Jeff Give me that! He doesn't do EPO!,"Hmm...what do you think? That was a different way to go but, I don't know, I just didn't buy it. Does she handle any of your injections?"
You think I'm giving it to him? Test him!,"Gee, that's a great idea."
That stuff could kill me.,"scoffs at them by mimicking Jeff Come on, give her a break."
I would nEver do anything to hurt you.,Who're you going to beliEve? Manager you've trusted for years? Snorts I've been to college
It's not possible. The drugs should be flushing out of his system.,Can't leave if they don't exist.
"But EPO use explains Every one of his symptoms. He's been lying and cheating, and now it's coming back to bite him.",The only pRoblem with that theory is it's based on the assumption that the universe is a just place.
You're still not explaining the PRCA.,What's his red count now?
"Had to give him a blood transfusion, he's back around 30.",He needed a transfusion?
"Well he was losing blood, so I thought maybe he needed blood.",makes a dramatic gesture with the stirring stick Go forth and scan his neck.
makes a dramatic gesture with the stirring stick Go forth and scan his neck. His neck?,Or repeat Everything I say in question form.
Or repeat Everything I say in question form.,She came into the clinic and yelled at me. Then she left. Then she came back and yelled some more.
Hmm. Yelling. That might be a clue.,"I know what the yelling means, it's the coming and going I find interesting. It's not rational."
Anger's not rational?,"Some anger is. She could have pulled me aside, screamed at me privately. Her beef is simple and well-founded. She was out of control."
You're having fun aren't you?,"She's in my face, I need to know why."
"She's in my face, I need to know why. Professional reasons.","Oh, why else?"
How'd you know to look in his neck? Thymoma's usually present in the chest,I knew it wasn't in his chest. All we've done since he checked in is look at his chest.
All the more reason not to think--,There are two types of PRCA.
"With that kind of anaemia, he would have needed constant... Blood transfusions.",Which he was getting in convenient blood-doping form.
He was treating himself without Even knowing it.,Up to half of Patients with chronic PRCA have a thymoma. And up to half of Patients with a thymoma! takes out a syringe I've always wanted to do this.
Does that mean I'm-- Ow.,You are healed! Rise and walk.
Are you insane?,"In the Bible, you just say Yes Lord and then, start right in on the praising."
"First you tell me I've got cancer, and then you tell me that my Manager-- starts making a hand gesture then realises he can actually move his hand What did you do?","No, what did you Lord."
It can hit you that fast?,"Treatment for PRCA is blood transfusions, treatment for MG is hyperbaria."
So... the whole thing with my Manager..?,"raises his hand to his lips Ooops. No, no EPO. This has nothing to do with anything you did. You can let her know she's in the clear."
"I could. Or, 10 percent of a Nike contract is a hell of a lot of cash.","makes a snarky face when Jeff isn't looking You don't need your thymus. Take it out, Everything else is Manageable."
Manageable. I thought you just cured me.,"Nuh uh, this is just diagnostic."
"You've come to search my office you should wait ten minutes I'll be out of your hair. Here, start with my purse throws it across to House just save me some mints. What do you want to know? My sex life with Mark? My guilt over crippling your damn leg? Or are you just here to gloat because you weren't the leak?",I want to apologise he solemnly sits down Maybe I've been punishing you for a little too long.
I hate you. And I love you. And I love Mark.,You don't hate him?
You don't hate him? No.,So what do we do?
We deal with each other.,Right. That plan's been working great so far.
"It'll get better, it'll get easier.",Why?
smiling You'd be surprised what you can live with. walks out of the office,"Hey, I need you to open that door."
"Hey, I need you to open that door. Not allowed.","Yeah er... I was having therapy in here today, and er, I left my cane."
"I was having therapy in here today, and er, I left my cane. Sorry.",Dude! I'm crippled.
My offer's withdrawn you can walk to work.,"Got it, you're morally outraged. Now can we get through this part? 'Cause the next part's awesome. He takes a bite of toast."
How do you rationalize something like this? You broke into Stacy's therapist's office--,Borrowed a key
--and stole her treatment notes!,"Nope! I made copies. Mark is, and I quote Wilson groans. Withdrawn, passive-aggressive, won't communiCate, like he resents me because I can walk."
I don't want to hear this.,"Dishes in the sink, toilet seat up."
It says she thinks you're an annoying jerk. Throws the notes on to a table.,It's a pet name. Picks the notes back up. Here's the kicker. Shows the notes to Wilson again Wilson reads it again with interest this time.
They're not having sex? House and Wilson share a look.,"Doctor cleared him, but no liftoff. She's frustrated so she's doc-blocking me. Paperwork, seminars, meddling with my Patients"
"Great, now you've got the proof you need. Just take those personal psych records to Cuddy, that'll show her Stacy's out of control. House turns away, looking for something. You ignoring me?","While looking for my newspaper, efficient huh?"
Over here! Camera pans to a young Man leaning against the back of Wilson's car reading House's newspaper.,"Sighs. Dr Wilson, I want you to meet my stalker"
Your waiting room sucks.,I am not treating you.
Err... we're not... err... together.,"Turns around to give Wilson a look. He is so self-loathing. Grabs the newspaper from Kalvin. Well, we've got to go now, so maybe see you after work--"
"No, no, no! Ah... Pushes his file into House's hands. nobody can figure out what's wrong with me.",Doesn't bother to look at the file.
"Brilliant, but, Grabs the end of House's cane. my immune system is fine.",Your concentration camp physique begs to differ. Get your T-cell count re-checked.
It was negative.,All of this will be fascinating to an HIV specialist. Now let go of my cane before it becomes your new boyfriend.
"Honey, I will marry it if you would look at my file.","Congress says you can't, so..."
"Congress says you can't, so...",I didn't touch him. He's intrigued.
Go see Stacy.,"We gave him epi, he's fine."
"You need a Lawyer, go see Stacy. You hit a Patient.","Four words, two mistakes. He's not a Patient, and I didn't hit him."
"Of course you didn't, go see Stacy.",I didn't cause the anaphylaxis. It's pRobably one of his HIV meds abacavir.
You have to treat him.,"Medically, this case is a snooze-fest. AIDS plus infection."
You don't treat him he charges you with assault.,Just 'cause he says I hit him doesn't make it true.
I forgot Wednesday was hooker day. This could've waited!,You make me meet you at your House. Your husband is conveniently absent.
"Mark's at physio, I'm stuck waiting for the exterminator. House gives a questioning look. I saw a rat last night.","Well, I'm surprised your feet are touParkng the floor."
I barely slept.,Takes off his jacket.
What're you doing?,"Sorry, it's driving me nuts."
You hate washing dishes.,People change. I could make sure you'd sleep like a baby tonight.
Rather take care of that myself. Walks up to the sink to help House.,I was referring to the rat.
What's going on?,"It's not what you think. I know it looks like we're cleaning dishes, but actually we're having sex."
"Take ten minutes, cure the guy, and stop whining. Walks after Mark.","I give you Kalvin Ryan so flamboyant in person, so boring on paper. Obviously got an opportunistic infection, pRobably TB or PCP."
Have you read his file?,"I started, but I found the characters two-dimensional."
"He went to an HIV clinic last week. Tested negative for TB, PCP, MAC, CMV, HSV. It's not an infection.","HIV clinic. So few Patients, so much money Sorts his mail. re-do the tests."
The results make sense. Kalvin's T-cells are at 200.That's strong enough to fight infection.,"Fine, parasite."
Face it this might be an interesting case.,What if his immune system is too strong?
"An auto-immune disease? With HIV, that's impossible.",His new HIV meds kicked his system out of a sound sleep.
"His meds made him so much better, he made himself sick. Sounds pretty--","BORING! This is so not interesting. Chest X-ray and find the old infections, start him on steroids."
"If you're wrong, steroids will tank his immune system. He'll get worse.",Now THAT would be interesting. Where's the coumadin?
If your Patient's got a blood pRoblem then blood thinners aren't exactly--,It's for Stacy's rat death by anti-coagulation. He reaches for a bottle.
Trying to win Stacy back by killing an animal... very caveMan.,"I don't want her back. I just want her to admit her feelings for me. I go to Cuddy, Cuddy fires her or re-assigns her. Either way, I'm happy."
"Pinches the bridge of his nose. If you want her back, either tell her, or, better yet, shut up, and cry yourself to sleep like Everybody else.",Picks up the phone.
It ran into that heating vent right there.,Hopefully Mark's anger will go away Eventually.
"He's not angry, just doesn't like you. Nothing unique there.","Didn't seem really wild about you, either."
He's fine with me.,He's angry. Said so in group.
Of course he's angry he's looking at months of painful physio.,Smells a ball of cheese he brought wrapped in foil. He's mad at you.
There's no way he said that.,"Sighs. No, but it's true. He resents you for being able to walk. Been there. I resented you for hell of a long time."
Might be the hospital. She walks out.,Picks up the cell phone. What!?
Bad time? Where are you?,At your girlfriend's place. Ignore the moaning and squeaking.
His lungs are too scarred to tell which infection triggered the immune reconstitution.,He a smoker?
"Yes, and possibly more than cigarettes. His tox screen came back positive for recreational drugs.",Not surprising. Not medically relevant.
His heart looks a little enlarged.,That's a typical side-effect of AZT. What are Kalvin's most recent infections?
"Toxo, CMV and PCP.",Whispers into the phone. Well let's assume it's one of those. Give him Ganciclovir for the CMV...
"Whoa, we can hardly hear you. Where are you?","In a closet. Your girlfriend's other boyfriend showed up. Ganciclovir for the CMV, Sulfadiazine for the Toxo, Bactrim for PCP. Gotta go. It's killing time. Puts down the phone."
"I recommend post-exposure prophylaxis. Your chances of conversion are slim, but I'd like to put you on three antiviral medications finavir, zidovudine and lamivudine. There are side-effects - headache, nausea, vivid dreaming. You'll be tested for HIV in 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months... His voice starts to fade away as the background music becomes louder.",Very interesting.
"He coughs infected blood in Cameron's eyes and mouth, that's interesting?","The coughing part, not the in Cameron part. New symptom, blood vessel ruptured in his lung."
I closed the tear.,Well it takes immune reconstitution off the table.
You know some huMan beings are actually capable of huMan feelings.,My giving a damn or not is not going to change what happened.
Could be Kaposi's Syndrome.,"No edema, no blood in urine."
"He puts a hand on her shoulder, she shrugs it off. I'm fine.","Oh this is good, he's pretending to care, you're pretending not to."
I think we should reconsider drugs. Kalvin uses crystal meth.,Concerned enough about his health to stalk me while indulging in deadly street drugs. Takes a vicodin. Study in contradictions. Interesting. Still not medically relevant.
"It could be, if his drugs were tainted. They cook meth with battery acid, lye, lantern fuel...","Find Kalvin's pills, test for toxins Ducklings start to walk out. Foreman, you're with me."
"Find Kalvin's pills, test for toxins Ducklings start to walk out. Foreman, you're with me.",I need a consult on another case.
You have another case?,It's a hip-pocket deal. Patient presents with a distinct neck tilt.
Wry Neck. Is he an athlete?,He's a regular runner.
Any pain associated with movement.,"None that he's complained of They reach a vending maParkne, House gestures for Foreman to hand him some coins which Foreman does automatically."
"Best case scenario, an infection in the ear or lungs worst case, brain stem tumor. Should do an MRI, CAT scan, full work-up.",Uhh! I don't think so Gets his drink from the vending maParkne. No insurance.
"Pre-World War II fluorescent bulbs contained large amounts of beryllium. Beryllium dust inflames the lungs, they get rigid, Patient can't breathe. House gives him a questioning look. My father co-authored a paper on acute berylliosis.","Phew! For a moment there I thought you were smart. Cameron, get a biopsy of Calvin's lung tissue. Run a spectrographic analysis."
I can handle it.,No reason to risk exposing the entire team. Then who would I torment?
Rushes in to find House sitting in the middle of her attic. You broke into my House?,"Well I had to, Mark isn't here."
He has physio.,Oh really? How's he doing?
What happened with all the cheese?,I had to get rid of it before Steve McQueen ate any coumadin.
Death cures both those things.,Well we can't kill him.
Oh! She turns away in disgust.,"Sniffs it. You missing any asparagus? Ok, stuff these. He hands her a bottle of antibiotics. He doesn't get better, then it's a tumor."
Then what? Chemo?,Steve McQueen without hair? Shakes his head. It's a blessing he died young. They both smile.
Looking at Cameron. You ok?,"She's fine, pRobably getting bored with the question. Masses in the heart and lungs, what kind of cancer are we looking at?"
"Lymphoma's a death sentence, sarcoidosis is treatable.","So's an ear infection, but since he didn't test positive for that either!"
I wanna do the Kveim-Siltzbach test.,Splutters. Do you have any idea how much paperwork Cuddy is going to need signed? Cameron doesn't budge House seems to like that idea a lot. Do it.
Splutters. Do you have any idea how much paperwork Cuddy is going to need signed? Cameron doesn't budge House seems to like that idea a lot. Do it.,So! how is the Patient's father?
how is the Patient's father? Uh!,'Tell my dad I'm sorry?' Might as well wave the red flag at a bull.
He's not coming.,"Well it's not a tragedy, dad doesn't want to see him, he doesn't want to see the dad. You're the only one who wants them together."
You're the only one who wants them together. He asked!,He thought he was dying.
What did you say when you thought you were dying?,"Pregnant pause. On the other hand, Cameron sighs, not getting an answer as usual. his dad tossed him out. So what's our guy want to apologize for?"
So you just show up Every time he's at physio?,"'Course not! Also when he's at group therapy, or out for dinner with friends."
And when she happens to mention to Mark that you dropped by?,You tell your wife Everything?
"It's a! process. Sighs. But Stacy doesn't have any reason to hide this from Mark. Follows House out of the office. As far as she knows, Mark's okay with you being there.","My bet is she mentions me to Mark as little as possible, 'cause she thinks that he thinks that she still has feelings for me."
Because she still has feelings for you? Deadpan voice.,"If you're right, she did tell him, and I don't get through the door tonight. But if I'm right! House gets into the elevator, the door closes."
So how long do we stay here?,'Til something happens.
He's not going to come out with us right here.,"We are downwind, and he seems to have hearing loss."
He's not blind.,Steve McQueen does not run from danger. Antibiotics on the other hand! He picks a pill up from the floor.
He ate around the pill? Smart!,"Admit it, you like him."
He's alright! for a rat.,You wanna now how cool he is?
"Okay, I blow my smoke into the vents so Mark doesn't know.",I always knew.
I always knew. Bluffing!,"You started two weeks after my surgery. Menthols, then lights after a month."
Why didn't you say anything?,"'Cause it helped me monitor your misery lEvel. One trip outside was a good day, upwards of six you were in hell."
You could have asked me how I was!,I already knew. Sorry you were miserable.
Come on Chase don't turn into a good guy on me now.,You're late! and hung over. Looks carefully at Cameron. Or maybe not.
Why do you have a rat?,Jealous?
Like hell it isn't! At Cameron. You said you didn't call!,Don't mind me. Just here for the show.
"Yeah well, there's not going to be any.","What happened to the big apology? Yesterday he was all 'Daddy, I'm so sowwy.'"
This is none of your business.,You should have thought of that before you stalked me. Now I'm interested. To the dad. So what's he got to apologize for? You're the one who tossed him out.
Now why would I do that?,I don't know. 'Cause it's tough to brag to your hunting buddies that your son knows all the words of The Wiz.
That's a lie!,42nd Street?
Just leave it alone.,Just want to leave the bigot with some peace of mind after you're gone?
"Look, this has got nothing, and I mean nothing to do with him being gay! Now Kal brought this on himself, with what he did to his mother!",He steal her signature look?
"No, he killed her. Kalvin lied!","Yeah, that certainly is shocking."
"Pacing and talking very fast. Mom's kidneys were failing, she needed a transplant, they tested Kalvin, he was a match. He was also positive for HIV, mom nEver found a qualified donor, she dies.",Tragic tale. Undercut slightly by the rapid fire delivery and constant movement. Too much coffee this morning?
So you always use a condom? Uhh... yeah!,Brother's on the down-low got to
To House. You?,Working girls are sticklers. You're not going to poll Chase? She looks at him sharply.
I'm not an idiot.,Obviously not.
"He gives Cameron and Chase a pointed look that plainly speaks of lEvels of satisfaction for finding out Foreman looks surprised, but grins. Where's Wilson?",We got the result for the Kveim test. Shakes his head slightly. Cameron sighs.
So now you've got to drum up another excuse to be around the love of your life. Could hit another Patient.,"Nyah, don't like to repeat myself. People will say I'm formulaic."
Well that rules out letting the rat go so you can catch him again.,"I can't do that, Steve needs two weeks antibiotics and a smoke-free environment. Cigarettes aggravated his infection."
The rat is actually sick? That thing could infect the entire hospital!,Steve's infection is not contagious to huMans. I'm an idiot. How did I miss mycoplasmosis? Was that the kid's father?
Yeah. Remember the Black Death? Started with rats,What's he doing in the hallway? His kid getting his biopsy already?
He just won't go in the room. Who knows what else he has - parasites? Bacterial infection?,Kid doesn't have parasites.
"Not the kid, the rat!",Was he still sweating?
Rats only sweat through their tails.,"Not the rat, the dad! Wilson doesn't have an answer. House starts walking back towards the dad. Where are they from?"
Err! Montana. What's going on?,"You were right, it's a parasite."
"Yeah, uhh! I'm not going in there.",Your son asked to talk to you.
As dad walks in. Why is he here?,Slides the door closed. He wanted to talk to you.
Makes a noise as he suddenly realizes that House lied to him.,Did you two use to hunt together? Foxes. Did you kill foxes?
Did you kill foxes? It's Montana.,Walks towards Kalvin.
I've been tested for parasites.,"Okay, it's cancer. You happy? The cysts isolate the parasites, keeping them from showing up in stool samples, Even in blood tests, cardiac--"
"All right, you don't need me for this.",But you've got the same things in your liver.
I have cirrhosis.,"Liver cysts have identical symptoms with one addition, fEver. Now liver cysts we can test for. Your diagnosis could confirm Kalvin's. So, option A, we draw some blood--"
"No, look, you're not touParkng me.","You see, this is why I need you here. I want you to tell your son that you won't take a simple painless blood test to save his life."
"If you'd have worn a damn rubber, you'd have been fine could have saved her life. You wouldn't be lying here!","Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it!"
I'm living my life the way I want.,To the dad. Are you going to give me some blood?
"Look, if he doesn't give a damn then neither do I!",Okay. Option B. Why did your wife kill herself? Did she hate you?
You know you don't know a thing about my Suzanne.,"Either Suzanne wanted to die, or she was both fat AND stupid."
"And girls with big appetites, well they just can't get enough - of anything! Shut up!",PRobably nibbled on Every devil dog in the county!
PRobably nibbled on Every devil dog in the county! SHUT UP!,"Just in case I'm not making myself clear, I don't mean the delicious snack!"
"Punches House, forcing House to reel back against the window. You son of a bitch! Yeah? Come on!",Pats his jaw very calmly.
Are you out of your mind?!,You said you didn't care.
"You said you didn't care. House uses his cane to push the dad back against the wall by pushing it against his neck. Notice how you can't breathe? The father sounds like he's choking/wheezing/going into shock. Now either that's the cane, or I just ruptured one of those liver cysts we were chatting about and you've gone into anaphylactic shock, exactly the same as your son did when he accidentally tripped against my friend's car. I'm just SO excited to find out which! House takes his cane off and the father slips to the floor clutParkng at his middle section. I'm gonna schedule surgery.","Two successful surgeries, two lives saved. I'm over my quota. Can I have next week off?"
Two family members assaulted.,It was self defense.
You baited him.,"You're right. I was asking for it. The low-cut blouse, the 'Do-Me' pumps."
"You flooded his gut with a parasite, he could sue. Go see Stacy.",Okay. Gets up to leave.
That's it? Okay? No name-calling? No squawking? No rending of garments?,I like this T-shirt.
Heard you hit another Patient.,"Yeah, sure. Why not? He hit me first."
Cuddy didn't mention that. Let me see. She comes around the desk to look at his jaw.,I'm the doctor.
"My concern is purely legal. Pats the skin where he got punched. Looks okay, does it hurt?",A little.
You need some ice. She goes to fetch some from the little fridge in the corner.,There's no way that Mark doesn't know Stacy turns around. about the smoking.
He would have said something. She applies some ice wrapped in a cloth to the purpling area where he got punched.,Then he hasn't been near you in months.
Then he hasn't been near you in months. We're fine.,Can't be easy.
Can't be easy. Stop squirming.,Why would you lie about this?
I'm not lying.,"I don't care if you're sleeping with him or not, but you're not, so!"
I am. Stops trying to put the ice on the bruise.,You're lying.
You know when I have sex? You can smell that on me too? The only people who know about what's going on between me and Mark are me and Mark.,I just know you.
"And I know you. You're confident, arrogant, but you're nEver certain unless there's a reason to be certain. One other person knew, I told you I was seeing Dr Harper. You can easily get into her office, you read my file. House doesn't deny it. You read my file? She now sounds like she's about to break into tears. The dishes, the concern, the, oh, acting like a huMan being? You have! This whole time you've been Manipulating me?",You knew I had an angle the moment I poured soap onto a scrub brush.
"Because 40% of our lawsuits last year were about House. You can't work with him, you can't work here.",She's over-reacting.
"You snuck into her shrink's office and read her private file. When Nixon did that, he got impeached.",So you're saying I'm not allowed to have oral sex with an intern either?
Scores a coin in House's hands. Yes! And yes.,The file got me on the floor of her attic with her pouring out her soul.
Walking into the office carrying a handful of papers. Where's Chase?,He's too busy to service you until after work.
Throws the pieces of paper on to the table in front of House. This one says you're okay with moving the disciplinary hearing to tomorrow. This one says I've advised you of your legal rights.,"Uh huh, any legal rights I should know about?"
"Nope. Angrily tosses her pen on to the table, Wilson winces.",Great. To Wilson. And you thought this was going to be awkward. He signs the papers.
"It's typically small joints, this hit her knee. Takayasu's arthritis.",Get a sed rate and serologies. He keeps struggling as he can't get the lid open. Parkld proof. How Many kids are hopped up on vicodin?
How Many kids are hopped up on vicodin? Gimme.,"Right, like I'd Ever get it back. Chase. He tosses the bottle to Chase."
"No, she'd have oral sores.",Or genital. To Chase. Go find them.
She'd have oral sores.,Or genital. Go find them.
Or genital. Go find them.,"Whoa, whoa Foreman! Chase can handle the pelvic."
She's only advising Chase? Not you?,Well what's the committee going to do to me? I haven't Even met this Patient.
"Your disdain for huMan interaction doesn't exculpate you, it inculpates you. You sign the charts, you're responsible for Everything Chase does.","Which is why this doesn't matter she protects Chase, she protects me."
"Unless her advice to Chase is to make a deal and give you up. He fakes a VERY bad Australian accent. I'm so sorry, if only Dr. House had paid attention, he'd nEver Even met her, he nEver does.",Chase loves me. And isn't Turkish.
Cameron loves you. Chase loves his job.,Is about to enter an exam room in the clinic. You really think Stacy hates me that much?
Systolic BP's 70.,Where's the ulcer?
There. Second ulcer?,Not anymore. It perforated.
Two months like this.,"Let me guess, no insurance, just heard about the free clinic. It's a good move. You don't want to skimp on the essentials like wristwatches, MP3 players!"
I need to talk to you.,From the doorway?
From the doorway? It's confidential.,Cool.
Two questions. Why did Chase screw up and how bad was it?,Wow. Talk about efficient. I only need one answer - Chase didn't screw up.
He said he did.,"Well I'm not a Lawyer, but that seems like a sucky legal strategy."
They're gonna wanna know what you think a reasonable doctor would have done in Chase's position.,"If I thought he was a 'reasonable' doctor, I wouldn't have hired him."
God you two are a couple of geniuses. Deny Everything completely fool the Lawyer who's trying to help you. Too bad the review committee members are actually doctors.,Stacy.
"Bleeding ulcer, we've got it. She was fine 2 hours ago.","If by 'fine', you mean she had fountains of blood spurting out of Every orifice then yeah, I beliEve you."
"If by 'fine', you mean she had fountains of blood spurting out of Every orifice then yeah, I beliEve you.",I'm guessing those are celebratory bells.
Systolic BP's 70.,Show me the ulcer.
It's brown. I cauterized it.,"Sweep back, show me the whole stomach. Chase sweeps the camera back. Stop."
Stop. Second ulcer?,Not anymore. It perforated.
Let's go. The nurses wheel Kayla after him.,She was not fine 2 hours ago. She mentioned stomach pain?
"Yeah, so I gave her a stronger--",You didn't do an exam.
She just came in for a follow-up. The results of the pathergy test.,Did you listen to her stomach? Check her vitals?
"Maybe if she'd said something about taking ibuprofen, mentioned the rectal bleeding!","Yeah, why didn't she go to med school like you did?! Diarrhea! Blood in the stool! These are routine questions--"
Doctors skip all the time! It was a minor mistake I couldn't have known this was going to happen--,Mistakes are as serious as the results they cause! This Woman could die because you were too lazy to ask one simple question!
She might die because I had the bad luck to spill your damn vicodin pills!,"And I responded with a number of trenchant remarks which made Chase cry, none of which I'm going to testify about."
"And I responded with a number of trenchant remarks which made Chase cry, none of which I'm going to testify about.",Unless you convince Chase to roll on me.
"Excuse me, testify about what?",Uhh!
Like I have?,"Buck has idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. His lung tissue's turning to rock. There's no known cause, no treatment. He is slowly suffocating."
You're talking about me?,"Lung transplant's about a half a million dollars, but this poor sucker's got no insurance."
That's how you tell this guy he's dying?,"Oh relax. He's got a cold, and soon, health insurance."
Such a hero always righting wrongs. Who cares who you have to Manipulate.,I'm sorry. I didn't realize you and Buck were so close. Walks out of the exam room.
It's a point of principle.,Right. It's got nothing to do with what I did to you.
There's nothing for us to talk about.,Takes some lollipops from the clinic counter and puts them in his pocket. That's why you're following me. I read some notes--
If Chase screwed up--,"I was wrong. Terribly, terribly, sorry."
"If Chase screwed up so badly, why didn't you fire him?",He has great hair.
Grabbing on to House's arm to stop him from walking away. What are you hiding?,"I'm gay. Oh, that's not what you meant. It does explain a lot though. No girlfriend, always with Wilson, obsession with sneakers..."
Forget it. We can't give a liver to a Woman this sick.,Do you listen to what you're saying?
And kidney damage. It's healing.,You know what's really killing her?
"Your point, beyond just trying to make Chase wet himself seems to be that the hospital faces liability here. Well thanks for clearing that up. I still need a medical reason to list her.",That is a medical reason!
Your Patient's hardly clotting.,Sub-Q vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma pre-op.
Sub-Q vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma pre-op. Pretty risky.,Well that's why I came to the best transplant surgeon in the hospital. She's dead without you.
Smiles. Get her in this afternoon.,Sighs. Thank you very much.
"And this was right before you ran the marathon, I suppose?","Was it the part where he warmly clasped my hands in thanks, was that too much?"
What'd you do to him?,The hospital Lawyer asks me if I did something unethical.
You'll tell me.,Oh.
"Anything you say is attorney-client. So you can get advice about the bad, bad thing you did, knowing I'll be tortured because I can't tell a soul.","He winks. Actually, it is kinda cool."
"Are you completely out of your mind? She's dying on her own, why would I volunteer to be her executioner? House hands him an envelope. I'd just be inviting a lawsuit from the brother, no matter what! He opens the envelope, there's money inside.","5 grand. And that's just ante money. After the surgery, you get another 15. Though I warn you, that includes the tip."
Laughs scornfully. I make 600 grand a year you think I'm going to risk tanking my percentages for 20 thousand? He throws the envelope down on the table.,Shrugs. It's tax free.
"For the record, I hope the department takes you and Chase and drop-kicks both your asses out the back door.",Nods.
"Nods. Great He pockets the envelope. means I don't have to bother welshing on the 15 grand I would have owed you. If you don't do the surgery, He starts to walk away. I'm going to tell your wife that you've been sleeping with a series of nurses. Currently Nurse Cutler in Radiology. Now what's 600 grand divided by two?","Last Christmas party, Nurse Cutler handed you one of those little hotdogs."
There is no way you'll tell her.,Of course I won't.
"Of course I won't. I'm much too cowardly. AyersMan looks defeated. No, I'd just send an anonymous letter. Now I've uh... I've got an OR booked for 4 this afternoon. Are you free? Eats the sweet.",Hmm.
You bribed him and then you blackmailed him?!,She'd have been dead in 2 days if I hadn't made AyersMan do the surgery.
Leave the blackmail out of the story you tell the committee.,Tried to leave it out of the story I told you.
"Hey now! Don't do that! Hey what are you nuts?! Please, please! I didn't do it! I didn't do anything!","Apparently, someone sent an anonymous letter to his wife."
You blackmailed AyersMan before he performed the surgery and then you ratted him out anyway?!,"Doesn't seem fair, does it?"
"You just can't control yourself, can you? No matter how stupid, how self-destructive--","To make this conversation easier, can we discard the fiction that we're talking about anything other than what I did to you?"
"Yeah, I was thrilled about that.","Okay, it was a lousy thing to do, but if what I'd found was that Everything was all kittens and moonbeams in Markville, you'd be over it."
No I wouldn't!,You're mad at me for letting you know what I did because you liked where things were going.
"You're mad at me for letting you know what I did because you liked where things were going. And for that I actually am sorry. It was stupid. Stacy turns and leaves, House throws his head back and looks fairly heartbroken and dejected.","Let me tell you a story about a Patient He takes the earpieces out of her ears. the Patient we'll call, He checks her file. Fusan."
It's just stress from the strep.,"Please, Chase, you and this strep. Get a room already."
Points at House You House?,Umm...
"Could be Hep B, Hep C, right? It's treatable. You give her interferon, she's ok. Right?",You know a lot about hepatitis.
He just donated his liver.,You're flushed. You sick?
You sick? I'm tired.,You're hiding the fact that you're sick. Now why would you do that? He grabs Sam's right arm which has two tattoos on the forearm.
"Hey, wait, what are you!","Now either you specifically asked for a tattoo of a heart that's been left out in the sun too long, or that is a really bad home job."
It hasn't been active in years. She was going to die if I--,Sarcastic. You paid someone off? That is TOTALLY unethical! Get an MRI for him and his sister right now.
"She got Hep from me, didn't she?","No! No, no, no, God no! Serious. I think she got cancer from you."
"Just been served with papers. Actually paper one page. She reads it. Defendant Princeton-Plainsboro hospital and Dr Chase blah, blah, blah. Medical malpractice, negligence blah, blah.",You're surprised they're suing? You think people love Chase so much they're gonna just forgo--
Larry Wusekus. He's not crazy.,Ooh! I've been sued by him.
You have been hiding things and lying to me all day!,I haven't lied about anything.
"I was hung-over when she came back to see me. I'd been up half the night drinking, had a headache and I just wanted to get the hell out of there. Couldn't have cared less what your sister was saying about her stomach pain.",May I speak to my future former employee?
May I speak to my future former employee?,Great story.
You think I'm lying? It's exactly what I told him.,I'm sure it is. But you lied to him. You want him to sue you.
I killed his sister!,I ordered black coffee this morning and got cream. Everybody screws up.
They didn't put poison in your coffee.,I've seen you hung-over. You weren't the day you blew his sister's diagnosis.
What does it matter why? Is she less dead if I have a good excuse?,"If I thought you'd screwed up because you were drunk, I would have fired you."
"If I thought you'd screwed up because you were drunk, I would have fired you. You knew?",You were depressed and distracted. I assumed you'd gotten a phone call from your stepmom.
From behind him. Dr. Chase?,"Good news is, both your parents are dead now so! no reason to screw up this bad again."
How'd you know?,"There's this interconnected network of computers, or interweb where you can--"
How did you know to look?,Sighs. When he visited he told me he only had two months left. When you screwed up I did the math.
Why didn't you tell me he was dying?,He asked me not to.
Getting angry. So you just hung me out there to be blindsided.,Softly.
You're not going to say anything?,"I'm going to keep my mouth shut. Legally, it's better for me if you go down in flames."
Is Chase telling the committee about his dad?,I don't know. I thought you were going to get him to sell me out.
I wouldn't do that.,Why not?
You're my client too.,Yeah.
Maybe you were right... maybe that is the pRoblem.,So what do we do?
"After considering the testimonial and documentary evidence, this ad hoc committee in the matter of Kayla McGinley has reached a decision. Dr. Chase, your error resulted in a Patient's death. You also lied, both to your superiors and the Patient's brother. But taking into account the mitigating factor of your father's death, we've decided not to revoke your privileges. You'll receive one week's suspension and a letter in your perManent file. Chase looks reliEved. Now as for Dr. House! there is no evidence of a failure to supervise that would lead to disciplinary action. And yet, there is enough in the record to be very troubled by your conduct, House starts to look up in surprise. including certain allegations of blackmail He rolls his eyes. from members of the transplant team and by your general refusal to meet with your Patients. It should be noted that your Patient's cancer was diagnosed as the result of a direct physical examination of---","Not of the Patient, I met the brother. NEver met her. You want me to go to a family reunion Every time I take on a Patient?"
"The committee has determined that for no less than one month, Dr. House will have his practice supervised by another doctor, to be designated by Dr. Cuddy. This proceeding is adjourned.",To Cuddy. Did you know this was coming?
What's happening to Chase?,To Chase as he walks in. Now you're fired!
"!Calamari is still in the lead but Ample Parking is making strides he is now in fourth, third, and holding second place while Blue Calamari is at a steady speed! Camera pans to see House watParkng the monitor. !And down the stretch they come! Ample Parking comes from behind and it's Ample Parking by a nose! House looks disappointed. This is the last call for the third race. You may still wager if you hurry. Here's your information on race number three!","Out of the way, cripple coming through."
"Um, sixth race at Golden Downs I'll take the two and the four. Hey, that's my birthday! February 4th, 1963, you think that's a good bet? What's your birthday?","Take your time, don't worry that there's only thirty seconds to post."
"He wants a $2 exactabox, 2, 4, 6, 3. Give him $24. The Man fishes for money as Anica winks at House. Your turn.","Ninth at Gulf Street and Park five hundred on the 3 horse, Seminole Uprising to win."
Might as well burn your money.,I'll burn my winnings. Bigger flame.
"Damn it! She was 14 to 1, too.","Well, fat ass over there just saved you money."
No way Seminole Uprising's going to,"I don't bet on the horses, I bet on the jocks."
"Nice to have inside information. Anica collapses, but House is busy watParkng the race.","Is anybody here a doctor? Anica is seizing, and one Man straddles her and prepares to start CPR. You trying to cop a feel?"
I took a CPR class at the Y.,That would be useful if she was having a heart attack instead of a seizure.
Seizure? Hold her tongue down?,If you want to get a finger bitten off. Call an ambulance.
"Methodist is three blocks down, I could drive her.","Just make the call. House sees something interesting, and pulls up Anica's shirt slightly to see very discolored stretch marks/bruises."
What the hell is that?,How should I know? Tell the paramedics to take her to Princeton-Plainsboro. The doctor's name is House.
Gambling doesn't take away his pain. House enters.,"It does when I win. He throws a chart on the table. Hot OTB babe, has grand mal and inexplicable bruising. What up with that?"
You were just standing there and she started to seize?,"Spend as much time around the real people as I do, someone gets sick."
"Hot OTB babe? Obviously a working girl, pRobably an STD, infection.","No fEver, no infection."
"Alcohol abuse explains it all. Causes seizures and affects her blood's ability to clot, which causes bruising. Start her on heparin, she'll be fine by morning.","Except for the fact that the bruises are not peteParkal, which means it's not DIC."
"So the bruises were caused by trauma. She pRobably got beat up by a boyfriend, or a pimp.",What's that called when you Judge someone before Ever meeting them?
She's a regular at OTB. Somehow I don't see her holding down a 9-to-5 and going to PTA meetings.,I was there. I have a 9-to-3 job.
"It could be SLE, Familial Telangiectasia, or Even Cushing's.",Good. Start with those.
Start with those. Which one?,Cushing's. Explains the seizure and the bruising.
Not the anemia.,So she doesn't eat a lot of meat.
"DIC brought on by alcohol abuse is far more likely. Do a full workup, H and P, and lab her up, LP, MRI He starts to leave.","Whoa, whoa, whoa! Did you just, Ever so subtly, order me to get her medical history?"
"Cuddy put me in charge last week, so yeah.","It was a pretend in charge, formality to get past the suits in Legal."
"Hey, no worries. I'll let you keep your Parking space.",You can have it. You'll also need my handicap placard. Bend over.
"Well, you make a pretty convincing argument.","Chase killed that Woman, now Foreman's in charge?"
Do you wear a seatbelt? Is that really relevant to a seizure?,Skip it.
"How about, Were you vaccinated for polio? I think you gave me the form intended for FDR.",Looking at races. Will I like Teeny Tiny Moe in the fifth?
"I went 4 for 6 yesterday. You want winners, cure me first. Are you generally satisfied with your life?","It does not ask that. It does, and he puts the form aside."
You know I was going to ask what a respectable doctor was doing in an OTB parlor. Somehow that question doesn't seem relevant anymore.,What's your excuse?
Turns me on.,"Yeah? What else turns you on? Drugs? Casual sex? Rough sex? Casual rough sex? I'm a doctor, I need to know."
No sex just moved here. Haven't Even found a job yet. Don't know anybody.,"Came here without a job. That means you didn't move here, you moved away from somewhere else. He pokes at the marks on her torso. Does that hurt?"
Does that hurt? No.,Are you on prescription meds? Hormones? Prednisone?
I already answered that one I think it was question number 20-something.,"Well yeah, and I could reach down and get it, but that would kinda spoil the whole cool move."
I'm not on any medications.,You vegetarian?
"You vegetarian? No, why?","Because you might have something called Cushing's syndrome, which basically means that"
"My pituitary is overproducing ACTH, which is causing my adrenal glands to push too much cortisol into my bloodstream.","What a coincidence. I'm a doctor, too."
"Yeah, I had it last year. They did brain surgery, removed an adenoma from my pituitary.","Huh? What did you just say? You were right, House, her pituitary tumor regrew, it is Cushing's, uncanny how you do that!."
"Actually, it was Cameron's idea.","Nope, Cameron had three ideas. I chose one to encourage, to nurture"
"Yeah, you're all about the nurturing.",You need a hug?
I don't see any regrowth. You get her medical records faxed over?,"Work smart, not hard, that's my philosophy, boss."
Still don't see anything.,"Okay, so it's a micro-adenoma, too small to see."
So small it's not Even there.,"Right, it's just a coincidence that I predicted a rare condition that she happened to have a year ago."
Results from her LP back yet?,Didn't do an LP. Knew what she had. Foreman stops the test.
Go do the LP.,"Okay, I need you to roll over on your side, kiss your kneecaps."
I thought it only took one doctor to do this. I'm observing.,She's here to make sure I don't paralyze you.
"You've done this before, right?",Successfully?
He's kidding. He's an excellent doctor.,"I'm gonna numb the area with some lidocaine, and then we're off to the races!"
"He inserts the needle, Anica starts and gasps. Ow.",Felt like bone. Does that hurt?
Trying rounding your back a bit more.,"You're perfect just the way you are. Oops, that was all me."
You might want to move down one vertebra.,This is actually much harder than I remember.
"Try taking a deep breath. Dr. House, maybe I should take it from here.",Eighth time's the charm. Anica cries out again.
"You trying to piss off Foreman, huh?",Just let Alarm beeps.
BP's 240 over 140.,"Turn that thing off, will you?"
Take the needle out. Take the needle out!,"Okay. To nurse. It's a hypertensive crisis. Start her on IV low pressure drip, titrate to systolic less than 140, she'll be fine. Cameron, meet me in my office."
"Okay. To nurse. It's a hypertensive crisis. Start her on IV low pressure drip, titrate to systolic less than 140, she'll be fine. Cameron, meet me in my office.","At the risk of sounding redundant, and right, again, she has Cushing's. Cushing's."
"Right, the fact that you Mangled her LP has nothing to do with it.","Actually, it has Everything to do with it. Cushing's plus stress equals hypertensive crisis. Smart move, sending the rookie."
Her initial symptoms could have been caused by alcohol-induced DIC. She had a hypertensive crisis because it's been at least six hours since she had her last drink. She's detoxing.,The exact same moment that I'm futilely trying to give her an LP?
Not as rare as an invisible tumor.,Why didn't they put you in charge instead of Foreman?
You ordered MRIs for the entire maternity ward?,I was in a crazy mood.
"What do you expect me to do, House? Quit? Cry?","Actually, I expect you to act like what you are, my employee, my subordinate, my bitch."
"Well, since you asked nicely!","My God, I can't beliEve I got more than a year behind on my discharge summaries."
"Looks malignant, pRobably inoperable. I'd give her two months.","On the bright side, it still means I was right."
House assisting. That is funny. Too bad Foreman's gonna die.,Good afternoon. I'm going to be looking at your Perfect. Excuse me. Picks up phone. Need Dr. Foreman in Exam Room 1 for a consult. So when did this start?
A couple weeks ago. I didn't want to get pregnant. Jake's not into rubbers so I got on the jelly. You think I'm allergic or something?,You have an infection. Gonna need a sample.
I brought the jar.,"No, I meant a sample of your He looks up to see her holding a bottle of strawberry jelly. Oh boy. Okay, we have a neurological pRoblem here."
There's something wrong with my brain?,"Oh yeah. You can cover yourself up, got what I need. Foreman enters."
Foreman enters. What's up?,"Smell this. He waves the swab in Foreman's face. Smells like vaginosis, but it's not really my call."
"Great, I'll be sure to put a gold star by your name on the board. Anica's biopsy for pancreatic cancer was negative. He leaves.","Okay, I'm gonna give you some antibiotics, and you pRobably shouldn't have sex for awhile."
"Okay, I'm gonna give you some antibiotics, and you pRobably shouldn't have sex for awhile. How long?","On an evolutionary basis, I'd recommend forEver."
"Good news, she's not sick at all. Other than being an alcoholic.",The labs you sent yesterday put her ACTH at 64 picograms per milliliter.
"Chase, hold on. Chase stops.",How'd you get him trained so fast? Electronic collar? Got treats in your pocket?
Maybe she didn't read it because she knew there was nothing wrong with her. There is another explanation for the Cushing's maybe she injected herself with the ACTH. Her behavior suggests Munchausen's. She's had four hospitalizations in the last four months.,"Well, being hospitalized a lot certainly points to nothing being wrong with you."
She's had zero symptoms since she got here. The scarring on her pancreas could be caused by injecting herself with a benzene and setting off the seizures.,She's had brain surgery. You can fake a stomach ache you can't fake a brain tumor.
"You can fake an invisible one. We should check her apartment. Look for medications, syringes",Venous sampling's easier.
And more dangerous.,Not if you get caught breaking in.
Why do you think Cuddy picked Foreman over me? Have I done something wrong or if there's something I needed to improve on!,Would you shut up if I told you she wanted someone black?
How would you describe my leadership skills?,"Nonexistent. Otherwise, excellent."
There's more to being a leader than being a jerk!,The world will nEver know. He goes to his motorbike and turns it on.
"No, no way. It just snowed.","Yesterday, streets are clear. He throws her a helmet."
My car is right there.,There's construction on Elm. Bike will be faster. Cameron puts on the helmet and gets on behind House.
There's Even books in the bathroom.,"Well, either she's very smart or she has a sEvere fiber deficiency."
"She's got an appointment with her ophthalmologist on Tuesday and an appointment with her gynecologist on Thursday. Multiple appointments with multiple doctors, symptom of Munchausen's.","Or, just thinking outside the box, here, she has a vagina, and trouble reading."
Because you're looking for her to have a tumor.,And you are looking for! A person with Munchausen's syndrome drinks battery acid they don't go to an ophthalmologist to get their pupils dilated.
An ophthalmologist is a doctor. Attention is attention.,How Many hospitals have you contacted? Has one doctor said she's crazy? It's not Munchausen's!
It's not your call.,"If you think she's got Munchausen's then obviously you've got something to show the Man! A syringe in her apartment, a bottle of ACTH."
Munchausen's Patients are good at covering their tracks.,"Oh, right, so the fact that we found nothing proves that there's something."
"It's possible the surgeons just missed it. In that kind of surgery, you're just cutting and hoping",Of course!
Do the venous sampling. Get her consent. Cameron rolls her eyes and leaves.,"Nice move, boss. Way to cover your ass."
I just agreed with you.,Not because you think I'm right.
"Well, maybe longer. Would you be interested if this wasn't just pretend?",What did Mommy say I don't get any candy in my stocking?
Also the sign of a sociopath. What are you doing?,"Correcting your last note. We can't discharge her, she's sick. Anybody Ever tell you, you write like a girl?"
What? You got some other explanation for orange urine? It's Munchausen's.,"Correct, but not complete."
You just don't wanna admit that she skunked you.,"At the end of The Boy Who Cried Wolf, the wolf really does come, and he eats the sheep, and the boy, and his parents."
The wolf doesn't eat the parents!,It does when I tell it.
"You're not telling the story now, I am.","Look, I checked her records."
There's a million things she could have taken to have done that.,True.
She's not getting sicker.,She will!
If her bone marrow was dying the entire blood panel would be affected. Her white count's normal.,So far. We need to do a bone marrow biopsy.
"No, no more tests.","Look, you kick her to the curb with a Munchausen's diagnosis you're guaranteeing that no doctor will Ever listen to her again."
"We do more tests we'll only be feeding her psychosis. The more attention we give her, the more she'll want.",What if she doesn't know we're testing her?
"House, you were wrong. Live with it.",There's pRobably some blood left over from previous tests.
Blood tests alone can't confirm aplastic anemia.,"Yes, I know. That's why I want to do a bone marrow biopsy. But blood tests could show a systemic disease, viral or a toxin cause."
"Fine. You wanna test the extra blood, knock yourself out. But the Patient is off-limits.",And if the results are positive? I get my biopsy? It's the safe way to go.
And if the results are positive? I get my biopsy? It's the safe way to go.,I need all of these tests and a PCR done on this sample.
You're gonna need more blood.,Patient's empty.
Then I can't do it. She passes the sample back to him.,You can try.
"i can try to look like Salma Hayek, that's not gonna make it happen.","You may not have Salma's ass, but she doesn't have your eyes."
No. There's no way this is going to happen. Foreman leaves.,"See him walking down that street, so I ask you very confidentially, ain't he sweet?"
Fetal hemoglobin's also elevated.,"Eh, just a wee bit. Could indiCate"
"Uh, you see that in sickle-cell.",Not all sickle-cell Patients are black.
"None of her other blood panels showed any sign of sickle-cell, which means either something's changed drastically since yesterday, or this isn't her blood.","Of course it is! Metaphorically. Look, I couldn't do the tests. I tried, there wasn't enough blood left over. If you just let me do the biopsy!"
"No way, I just got back from a suspension.","And if it wasn't for me, you would have been fired."
Why don't you just get the sample yourself? Since when do you care what your boss said?,"I don't care what anybody says, I care what they do."
"So come on, I'll draw the enemy fire, you outflank them, get in there, get the bone marrow sample. Can't.",Who are you more afraid of?
"I'm not afraid of Foreman. I agree with him, all the tests back him up.",All the tests have not been done. You do realize that Blackaparte's reign is only temporary.
"I also realize that no matter what I do, you're still gonna treat me like crap.",Crap is a relative term.
Nurses called the attending as soon as the trocar was ordered.,You used her real name?
I just processed your Patient's discharge papers. She's on her way out now.,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait up! It's all right, she's going to stay."
"It's all right, she's going to stay. Wonderful.","Oh, bite me."
I don't need to hear the riot act again.,How'd you like another medical test?
How'd you like another medical test? What?,Sit.
Sit. Why?,So you don't crack your skull when you pass out. Just do it. You know what colParkcine is?
You know what colParkcine is? No.,"Well, don't feel bad. It's for gout. It's got nothing to do with anything you've Ever pretended to have."
I'm not pretending to have any,"Shut up. ColParkcine decimates your white blood cells, leaves almost no trace. Great for faking your way into hospitals."
I didn't fake my way,Shut up.
I did not have a relative,"Shut up! I'm trying to give you what you want, and save your life. You have aplastic anemia."
"What, are you trying to scare me now?",It means you're not just sick in the head.
"So I need to know, have you been taking anything besides the insulin, the ACTH, and the pills Cameron left in your room? No.",Good. Give me your arm. House sticks her with the needle.
"It was my mom. She had MS. She was in and out of hospitals all the time. People were always trying to do things for her, bring her food, or brush her hair, make her happy. People cared. She died when I was 16. Then there was no one.",Boo hoo.
Where are you going?,"Well, I obviously can't be around when it happens."
"Well, what are you gonna do, you're just gonna leave me","Relax. You know the drill. People walk by here all the time, you'll be fine. House walks back inside as Anica collapses and starts to seize."
We can't. Her white count's down.,"Sorry, I missed that. My hearing's been off since the Ricky Martin concert, some chulo kicked me in the head."
"White count, hematocrit and platelets are all off. The bone marrow's shutting down, she actually has aplastic anemia.",Say what?
All her other labs show nothing that,Labs schmabs. A good diagnostician reads between the labs.
You were right.,"Hey, hey, hey, we're not here to play the blame game."
Okay. Where's Dr. House?,Turn it off.
Turn it off. Now what?,How long has she been in there?
"Three minutes, what's going on?",She doesn't have aplastic anemia. She has an infection.
"No, her white count would be through the roof, hers is on the floor.",The body does crazy things.
She had no fEver.,"Because her self-inflicted Cushing's suppressed her immune system, stopped her from having a fEver, hid the infection. Clostridium perfringens could cause the bruising, the sParkstocytes, the anemia!"
Explains Everything except the white count.,"Augmentin is a lot safer than destroying her immune system, why don't we try that?"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're taking the safe course? What's going on?",There's lots of explanations for low white count.
Name one that fits her case.,"ColParkcine. I figured that she got her hands on it and just, uh, self-mediCated."
That's brilliant of her. Take the exact medication that would confirm your diagnosis.,People do crazy things.
You injected her against her will just so you could be right.,She consented.
She's mentally ill!,"She smells oh, so sweet."
"She smells oh, so sweet.",She would have gotten sicker when I said she was gonna get sicker except Cameron dosed her with antibiotics. Just hold this.
Is Everything okay?,Hold my finger.
"She should have died. House is not a hero. A person who has the guts to break a bad rule, they're a hero. House doesn't break rules, he ignores them. He's not Rosa Parks, he's an anarParkst. All he stands for is the right for Everyone to grab whatEver they want, whenEver they want. You tell doctors that's okay, your mortality rate is gonna go through the roof.","Kinda digging this whole Foreman in charge thing. Frees me up to watch my soaps, catch a movie in the afternoon, have lunch with you!"
"Yeah, that's a big change for you.","Now Cuddy's on Foreman's ass, not mine. They walk out of the hospital together."
You couldn't live with Foreman as your boss.,"Why not? People could change, you know?"
WhatEver you think is best.,"Last race at Belmont, put it all on the five. To win."
"Don't say anything don't attempt to defend your billing practices, your billing practices are indefensible.",We've been over this.
"If I thought you were capable of listening, I'd shut up.",That makes no sense at all.
Ah. Okay. Then let's go through these. He starts shuffling through the mountain of folders on the desk.,All of these?
"Patient, 62-yrs-old. You prescribed Viagra. I look in vain for the words 'erectile dysfunction' in the notes for Delores Smith?",She had a heart condition.
And you ran out of nitroglycerin?,"She also had low blood pressure, so nitro would be dangerous. Little blue pills improve blood flow, they're vasodilators. That's why you sometimes get the headaches."
I think Doctor House understands--,"Well of course I do. The Woman has a heart condition and she's on her own. A Man can't nail his office assistant, its national crisis time."
Are you seriously expecting us to foot the bill for off-label use of medication?,"Fine, I'll pay for it. He reaches for his wallet. How much are the pills? She took how Many?"
Are you trying to bribe me?,No! I could. There's an ATM in the lobby.
What can they do to you? And Doctor House is sorry Pointed look to House. about his earlier outburst.,Absolutely! He is pathetically insincere.
Absolutely! He is pathetically insincere.,You do background checks on Medicaid personnel?
I do what's necessary for my client. She checks her watch. Wow! New personal record!,"Yeah, time's good for me too got a reservation at a little place in the inner harbor."
You booked us dinner reservations?,Best Maryland crab in... Maryland.
Don't you have a plane to catch?,Not for hours.
Your flight leaves at 7.,You did a background check on me?
And mine doesn't leave until 9pm. It looks like you'll be dining alone.,"You checked on my flight, so you could be sure to be on a different one. Thought we were past the avoidance stage."
I didn't think we'd be finished this soon.,Where's your crucifix?
I left it at the jeweler's to be cleaned.,Riiight.
Uhhh... Looks at the caller ID. Excuse me. Picks up the phone. Hello.,"Hey Honey, how are the kids? They miss me?"
He hands the nurse a tissue and gets out of the booth he's seated in. This may take a minute.,What's new with Mr. Aphasia?
Cuddy called you?,Everybody covers their ass.
"Pulmonary edema. Chase did a tox screen, came back positive for amphetamines, he did the dance of victory.",I'm betting there's another shoe.
I thought the kids didn't call you.,I know the way you tell stories.
"Foreman went to talk to Stone about his drug test, found him running a temperature.",So it's not the drugs. He's just got such a bad rep. Ball bounces on the back of the chair again House turns around and glares at the kid AGAIN.
"Honey, you shouldn't do that.","Ok, I gotta hang up. They're pRobably trying to reach me."
You don't have call waiting?,I'm hanging up on you now.
He goes to pick up the phone. Foreman.,How high a fEver? Foreman raises his eyebrows in surprise. Put me on speakerphone. And why haven't you called me?
He puts House on speakerphone. Scene shifts between House in the airport and Ducklings in the office. 101. How'd you know?,"What, you think you guys could have a party as soon as the parents are gone and I won't hear about it?"
What if it's auto-immune?,Well then we're screwed.
"The Man can't talk, his medical records are sketchy, and wife's only known him a couple of years.",MRI show anything?
CT scan was negative.,"CT... that's like, short for MRI, right? Excellent, well I guess that saves us a lot of time."
We've got an MRI scheduled in 20 minutes. Earliest Foreman could get the maParkne.,"I teach you to lie, and cheat, and steal, and as soon as my back is turned you wait in line?"
The Man can't talk!,Who cares? He's pRobably going to lie anyway. My flight's a little late we'll be back in a few hours.
"What is the durable? Elizabeth quiets him down, he huffs. No.",Got you some coffee.
"Oh, sorry. Reservation for two.","When people give themselves away, it's by little things."
"Exasperated. Oh, I told you I left it--",You keep jewelery cleaner under the sink so you won't have to go a day without it.
It's different. Yeah.,Reading a book entitled LESBIAN PRISON STORIES.
"Leave it alone, Greg.","Yeah, I'm good at that. So that leaves forgetting it unintentionally, but then we'd have to explain why you didn't go back for it when you realized."
I didn't realize until I got to the airport.,"Nope, you were in make-up when you got to the airport. Can't put on make-up without looking at yourself and you can't look at yourself without touParkng that thing."
Why does this matter to you?,It's an anomaly. Anomalies bug me.
I'll be right back.,"I suppose it's also possible that the clasp broke, but then you'd be carrying the thing around in your purse."
"We had a fight. She turns around and snaps at him. We had a fight and I was angry and not thinking straight, and I walked out without my make-up and without my cross! I stopped at the drug store to buy make-up, but I couldn't buy a cross because they don't have an aisle for personal talisMans!!!","Immediately contrite. So you had a fight, I'm sure it'll blow over."
It was about nothing.,"Of course it was. Mark's tired, he's worried, he's got mobility pRoblems. It's normal that he'd blow up over little things."
"I don't mind fighting over little things! I don't Even mind fighting over big things! That I could understand. But we fight over nothing! You know a mailbox with a sign that says last pick-up 5pm, does that mean last pick-up to go to the post office, or last pick-up to leave the post office and be sent out of town?",You fought over mail delivery? He winces.
"I tried to get him to drop the subject, but he wouldn't. I told him he was right, he thought I was being condescending.",You were.
He's pushing me out of his life.,Maybe you're misinterpreting.
Did I misinterpret with you? At least this time I recognize it. That's the benefit of convincing the only two men you've Ever loved they're better off without you.,"He rolls his eyes. Yeah, it's all your fault. You know Stacy in the original Greek means relationship killer."
Hello? She hands the phone to House. It's for you.,House.
Do you know your phone's dead? Do you Ever recharge your batteries?,They recharge? I just keep buying new phones.
I thought you should know your aphasia guy is tasting metal.,What's his creatinine?
"It's obvious we have to do the lumbar puncture, there's no choice anymore.",You have to do it just right.
What are you talking about?,"Either you've decided to do a lumbar puncture, or you have to fire me so that I can't fire all of you as soon as I get back in charge."
If I'd known you'd be out of contact--,They can handle it.
Right. So far only 3 organ systems have failed.,"Ok, they can't. Doesn't matter, guy's not stable enough to move. So go rant in your own office."
What do you mean by doing the LP just right? We're not going to screw up.,The odds are this guy knows something we don't.
"He could know the answer to the meaning of life, the Man can't communiCate!",Have you had any indication that he's tried to communiCate something important?
Have you had any indication that he's tried to communiCate something important? No.,That's cause you guys haven't scared him enough.
"Attention please, due to weather conditions, our flights are grounded until further notice. Cots are being provided on the lower lEvel. We apologize for the inconvenience.",Want me to run down and reserve you a cot with view?
Where's your knapsack?,Checked it through.
"Oh, that's right. I forgot it was hard for you to carry and walk. I booked a room at the airport hotel when I saw how bad the weather was it was the last one available. Your leg can't handle a night on a cot.",Thanks. He looks shocked and stunned into quietness.
He looks shocked and stunned into quietness. I'm ready.,Right.
The hotel's upstairs.,Does Mark know about this?
Mark knows when things are bad I always like to have an escape route planned.,He closes the door.
That I'm feeling vulnerable and I don't want to be around you because it might lead to something.,Right. But then a hotel room...
Might also lead to something.,Hmm. So... which is it?
Our relationship is like an addiction. It's... like...,Really good drugs?
"No, it's like... vindaloo curry.","Ok, sure..."
"Really, really hot Indian curry they make with red Parkli peppers.",I know what it is! Didn't think it was addictive.
"You're abrasive and annoying and come on way too strong, like... vindaloo curry. And when you're crazy about curry, that's fine but no matter how much you love curry, you have too much of it, it takes the roof of your mouth off. And then you nEver want to see curry for a really, really long time but you wake up one day and you think... god I really miss curry.",He puts his hand under her Parkn and raises her face up so he can see her face.
You're a jerk.,I know He smiles and dumps his cane on the bed as he moves in closer to put his hands on her waist and then leans in kiss her on the lips.
Grabs his face in her hands. For once in your life will you shut up? She pulls him down and they lock lips again. He holds her close to him and she strokes his jaw as they go for it.,House.
You're on speakerphone.,How did the LP go? Give me the reader's digest condensed version.
"Preliminary results are some kind of infection, which... narrows it down...","From infinity, yeah."
"At the rate his organs are deteriorating, he's got maybe a day or two.",Ok!
He was trying to tell us something!,"He hesitates, then reluctantly puts the phone back against his ear. What did he say?"
"Looking very dishEveled. You were wrong, it wasn't the fear. He opened up to me when I...",Sympathetic presence after a traumatic moment. He steps away from Stacy reluctantly. Classic interrogation technique. What did he say?
You knew that I'd--,"Act the way you always do? Yeah, I did. What did he say?"
Now all we need is the English-aphasic dictionary.,A fluent aphasic retriEves words that are stored somewhere close to the one he wants.
He also said they took my stain?,Hold on.
He takes his cane from her. Sure.,Into the phone.
Let's start this again. Bear - is it bare as in naked?,Crimson desire shows up well on sheet rock.
That's why I chose it.,"Well you must have gotten one new phrase out of him, something?"
We've been talking to him for hours. Maybe he's just given up.,Are you sure you told me Everything you found in his home and office?
Maybe House is wrong.,Surprised. Hope that's not the end of the thought. He unplugs the charger so he can pace further afield.
"When his wife's not in the room. Foreman and Chase suddenly realize what Cameron says is true. The more devoted, the more reason to lie.",That's cynical!
That's cynical! You disagree?,"No, I'm just kvelling."
Your flight's been boarding for 20 minutes!,I'll take a later one.
"Greg they can't leave without you, you checked your knapsack.",Are we in?
Are we in? Yeah.,"Hi, I'm Gregory House I'm your attending physician, your wife's not there, start talking."
"They took my stain! I couldn't tackle the bear, they took my stain.","Ok, shut up now. Nice work, Cameron. Give him the list again."
Are we sure he wasn't reacting to pain? He's been on painkillers.,"Come on Chase, drugs didn't do this to him. Even if he is an addict."
I dissuade the tonal Category.,"Oh please. Mr. sleeping pills, amphetamines, bring me up, bring me down."
"Will passenger Gregory House, please report to Gate 7. Gregory House to Gate 7.","Ever hear this one? Build a House, each wall has a southern exposure, big bear comes wandering by, what colour's the bear?"
White. It's a polar bear you built your House in the North Pole.,"Polar. WhatEver your name is, Patient! Are you bipolar?"
"Polar. WhatEver your name is, Patient! Are you bipolar?","What's that? I can't see, is he nodding?"
"I can't see, is he nodding? Yes.",Topamax isn't just off-labeled for weight loss.
Except bipolar disorder does not cause seizures.,"And it doesn't shut down your kidneys, but what it does do--"
"Excuse me sir, can I see your ID?",I'm on the phone I'm on the phone
House? Gregory House--,"Look, I'm a Doctor, and this is an emergency call."
You'll have to come with me sir.,I'm not going anywhere.
You think you're gonna take me on?,"I kick, and I bite."
"House, you still there?","Being bipolar makes you take risks, you seek excitement. You make up stories."
I dine valutate a lEver! Indignant tone.,"Fine, maybe your stories are legit."
Which explained nothing because it wasn't Even in the right area.,"It's not the surgery, it's the secrecy!"
House! Shut up.,What's going on?
"You just don't trust me. He looks down guiltily again, she starts to cry silently.",Get some blood on a slide. Do not put it through a computer this time.
"Fletch, she'll be back. Give her time to miss you.",I'm counting on you to get me off the no-fly list.
Is your Patient going to be alright?,"Physically, his chances are good."
"Physically, his chances are good. Physically?",Two people who weren't meant to be together. Maybe they'll get a happy ending just because they both want it so much.
"Yeah, that's usually the way it works.",He loved her enough to convince himself he could change.
"But he couldn't, could he? She gets the stub of her ticket back from the person at the desk and is about to walk through when she turns around to see House again. You know what Woody Allen said about relationships? Irrational and crazy, but we go through it all because--",--we need the curry.
I'm on it. He goes after House.,"Morning, Jimmy. Anybody die while I was gone?"
Did -- did you iron your shirt?,Thought about shaving couldn't find a razor.
What the hell happened in Baltimore?,"Sorry, Parkef. I nEver kiss and tell. They get into elevator."
there's no such thing as just a kiss.,Did you iron your shirt? Everybody's flash today.
Are you planning on asking her to leave Mark?,Not sure. Cameron keeps my calendar.
Hey. This is a big deal. This is an affair. Have you Even talked to Stacy about what the hell this means?,Didn't have a lot of time for talking. Blatant wink. If you know what I mean.
Great. Breaking up a marriage fertile ground for high comedy. We need to talk about this. Footsteps...Cameron approaParkng.,"Gosh, wish I could. To Cameron. How did the HIV test go? Did you study up?"
I rescheduled for this afternoon. We have a new Patient. 34-year-old female. Movement disorder.,Movement disorder? Fascinating.
This isn't just gonna go away.,No. But maybe you will.
"According to her husband, the flailing started before she got anywhere near that car.",What does the flailing look like?
Her arms spasm uncontrollably and there's a mild facial twitch.,Demonstration?
"You wanna know what it looks like, go see the Patient.","Ooo, snarky. Was he like this the whole time I was gone?"
Huntington's takes a day to confirm. We should put her on Tamoxifen in case it is the fertility meds. Counteract the estrogen.,"It's a great idea, if you want to kill her baby. He writes Pregnancy on board. Movement disorder can present in the first trimester."
She's not pregnant.,Peeing on a stick is only 99% accurate.
WhatEver you want.,Lame duck's done quacking.
"You quack, people shoot at you. Cuddy just put me here to make you miserable. Another two days, you can go back to making yourself miserable.",Okay.
"Hyper-vigilance, sudden irritability...",Symptomatic of! lunch with Cuddy?
The Patient now defines Huntington's.,Then what do you need me for? Start her on Huntington's meds.
"If we start her on valproic acid, it could destroy her liver. Could stroke.","If we wait, she could progress to full blown psychosis. Then her kid will nEver get the chance to say goodbye. To Chase. Wanna tell the class how that feels?"
Huntington's Patients don't progress to psychosis in a day.,She went from 0 to 60 in world-record time. Foreman's beeper goes off.
"All the signs are there. Movement disorder, psychosis... It should be Huntington's.",Yeah.
"None of her family members are sick, nobody at her office, her volunteer group, kid's classes, and PTA members. Throws up her hands. All fine.","So she raises a daughter, runs a business, she does charity work, she volunteers at school, attends PTA. What makes mommy run?"
You're thinking drugs?,Cocaine.
I'll go look for her stash.,Take Foreman. There's gotta be a reason for the stereotype.
I know you're in there. I can hear you caring.,The door was locked.
"It's for a Patient. She can't roll. Looks toward the balcony. Now lock that door, too.",Paranoia must be the good stuff. Sniffs. Times like these I wish I had cancer. So what did she say?
"That depends. What did you do, and who are we talking about?",We both know that as soon as we talked you ran to Stacy so you could gossip and giggle. I need to know what she said.
I have a crazy idea why don't you go talk to her?,Because my bestest buddy says that could lead to trouble.
I didn't say do her. I said do something.,What exactly did she say?
She didn't say it was a mistake.,She's not gonna leave Mark in the middle of his rehab too much guilt.
She left you.,"Harsh toke, dude."
"House. House turns, Wilson gestures 'come here', and House takes a joint from his pocket and hands it to Wilson.",Killjoy.
Prescribed to her daughter.,Mommy does Everything for her family these days. Even swallows their pills.
It's possible the kid's meds are the kid's meds.,"Pop enough Ritalin, it can explain Everything."
Tox screen will confirm that.,Half-life's 12 hours. The drugs'll be out of her system. We're done. Get rid of her.
We're not done. We have to confirm the diagnosis before we send her home to die of something else.,"Oh yes, the power tastes so sweet."
"Yeah. Well, I'm still signing the charts. So until tomorrow, you're not allowed to kill anyone. Walks away.",Wuss.
We've asked her three times if she's on any meds.,So we don't ask her.
So we don't ask her.,"Candy striper. Hooks chair with his cane pulls it toward himself. To Stella So, you like dogs? Stella nods. House whistles bends the balloon into! a shape."
She's not on any medication.,"Well that's strange, because this bottle has her name on it. Shakes it. And I think these are medical pills inside."
Doctor prescribed Stella! a few months ago. I nEver told you about it because I nEver gave her any.,"Hmm. That's funny, 'cause the bottle's almost empty. To Stella. You missed a couple of days. Take five."
Take five. Stop.,"Why? Unless they're not hers. To Stella. You need some water, sweetie?"
I'm not taking Ritalin.,Come on. All the cool moms are doing it. And tox screen says you're cool too. Pulls out paper and holds it out to her.
Should take a couple of hours to process her. Then you can take her home and divorce her.,Working late? Or are you just avoiding Mark?
"It was one kiss, Greg.",So far. Comes in. I'm planning on keeping a chart.
"I'm moving back to Short Hills, I think it's time.",You're leaving?
It's nEver meant to be perManent. And now that Mark's getting better!,Yeah. Much better. Except for the whole walking thing.
He needs to get back to work. Turns away.,Right saving the next generation from making bad choices about acne cream. You're running away because the kiss meant something.
I'm not running away. I'm going home.,With Mark.
What's going on? Cam takes her pulse.,This better be important.
You've gotta come back in.,No I don't.
"Margo's stable, but--","Oh, my God. Well, I'll be right there."
What took you so long? It's midnight.,Traffic. Cinco de Mayo. To Foreman. You owe me a 100 bucks.
You didn't take the test?,Fear trumps anal Every time.
It's not a big deal. I had the viral load and antibody tests. It's 99.9% that I don't have HIV.,"You have the test and it's negative, you gain a tenth of a point. But if it's positive you lose! nearly 100, right?"
No arrhythmia. So Ritalin isn't the big pRoblem. Something else is going on.,Fine. Let's play doctors.
Wouldn't explain the movement disorder.,"Nothing explains Everything. What if it's a crime syndiCate? Let's say Ritalin and the fertility meds plotted a caper. Ritalin takes care of the psychosis, the flailing--"
I still don't think Ritalin--,Fertility meds are competitive by nature. They gotta do something bigger. Something really unexpected.
Which could cause clots. Which could have caused her to stroke.,So ultrasound her uterus this time. See if there's something growing in there that doesn't look adorable in a onesie. They all get up and walk toward the door.
So ultrasound her uterus this time. See if there's something growing in there that doesn't look adorable in a onesie. They all get up and walk toward the door.,Cameron. She turns. I love you. Her jaw drops he swabs her cheek. Get your test results tomorrow. She looks bewildered and leaves.
The prescription for my heart condition a bit on the cheesy side.,I was trying for roMantic. They smile at each other and hug. Still fits.
Still fits. Mmm.,Did you tell Mark?
"Am I going to tell him? Still working on that phrasing. How about 'Know all that stuff you were worried about when we first came here, Honey? You were right.'",Pithy.
Everything's easy when you don't care if you hurt anyone.,You already did the hurting part. He just doesn't know it yet.
"No endometrial thickening, no masses. No cancer.",She's on fertility treatments. She had a blood clot. It's there.
"Millions of women are on fertility treatments, and they don't get cancer.",Right. They get babies. She had a blood clot and a stroke. She'll get another one and pRobably die if we don't find that tumor. Do an endometrial biopsy.
We just did an ultrasound. What?,Shh.
If you have a personal issue that's interfering with--,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
What are we waiting for?,Your four weeks just expired.
What are you watParkng?,TV. What are you doing here?
Ted's with my mom. He asked the nurse to watch me.,What nurse?
Do you still have the balloons?,No.
Do you want to play something?,"Nope. Raises eyebrows, takes feet down, and turns off the TV. Taking her hand they exit together and walk down the hall."
When can Mommy come home?,Don't know.
What's wrong with your foot?,War wound.
Does it hurt?,Every day.
That's what my parents say when they don't want me to know something.,They say that a lot?
They don't fight.,Not Ever?
People who love each other don't fight.,Right. Forgot that. The elevator arrives. What floor was that nurse on who was watParkng you?
House. Foreman books it. Mark rolls over in his wheelchair.,What?
I'm here about Stacy.,What about her?
I think I'm losing her.,"Your wife, your pRoblem. Walks away, Mark rolls after him."
She won't talk to me.,"So what, you're gonna talk to me instead? Talk to your shrink."
She keeps saying Everything's fine.,Find a bar and talk to a stranger.
You're the only one who's been through this. House stops and turns. I'm shutting her out. I'm saying things and then hating myself for saying them. How did you get past that?,Didn't. Turns and walks away again.
Can you please be a huMan being for one minute and talk to me? House stops and turns again.,"Sorry gotta go, people dying. He turns and walks away."
House. Mark comes in and pulls himself out of his wheelchair onto the stairs. House turns and looks at him.,You're not ready for this.
I've seen the way you and Stacy talk to each other.,You're an idiot. You pRobably just set your rehab back three months.
"Let go of me! Get off of me! Mark falls down the stairs, sitting on them. House goes back down and through the door, leaving Mark sitting on the stairs.",Liver tumor doesn't make sense.
You saying the CT was wrong?,I'm saying the symptoms don't add up.
Side effects of the Ritalin caused the--,No.
She's a people pleaser. She doesn't like to let people down.,NEver fights with her husband.
She went to drugs instead of asking for help to Manage her life.,"So if she can't Manage now, why does she want another kid?"
"So if she can't Manage now, why does she want another kid?",Foreman.
I'm not saying anything until the metaphor plays itself out.,So here's the caper.
Birth control pills? They all exchange bewildered looks.,"While the surgeons are cutting out a chunk of your liver, should I have them do a hysterectomy too?"
A hysterectomy? I'm trying to get pregnant.,You don't have to lie to me.
What makes you think that I don't--,Because it fits. Birth control pills caused hepatocellular adenoma. Explains all your symptoms that aren't explained by your other lies.
Explains all your symptoms that aren't explained by your other lies. That's it?,Pulls out a paper. Also.
What are you going to tell my husband?,That I'm canceling the surgery.
Could--could I die on the table?,Could you die if you tell him the truth?
You can't cancel the surgery.,"If she goes off the pill, the tumor goes away on its own."
"You have no proof the birth control pills caused this, you have no proof she's Even taking them.","Well if we do the surgery, maybe we'll kill her on the table. Then I can prove I'm right at the autopsy."
"Or, we can forget the surgery, let the tumor grow, and kill her.",Why don't you take it up with Stacy? See which option minimizes your risk.
"Here's what I think she's gonna say. Beta Comment Doing a dang funny Stacey impression. Oh, I love Greg. But if you go against a Patient's wishes, you're calling her a liar. And if something goes wrong, I end up in court having to defend the big mean doctor, albeit with dreAmy eyes, who wouldn't beliEve the nice suburban mom. And Even though his cane makes me melt, do the damn surgery. She sits down, scoffs and rolls her eyes.",Shocking. It's benign.
People do crazy things for love.,No. Crazy is hanging out in the Park all day talking to pigeons. Margo knows what she's doing. She gave up half her liver to save her marriage.
"No, she surgically removed her fingerprints to cover up her pathetic lie.","It's twisted and Manipulative, I give you that. But it's also...roMantic. Wilson looks at him like he's nuts. I'm barely willing to put the seat down after I pee."
Do we need to talk?,Nope. I'm fine.
"You don't know. Smiles. In a few years, we'll give up. Stop trying to get pregnant. We'll hug cry. Eventually, Ted will stop thinking about it. And he'll appreciate Stella Even more. And we'll live happily together for the next 50 years. Smiles and looks satisfied. Foremen looks sick.",Something you need to see. He holds out envelope. She looks at him nervously. Knowing is always better than not knowing.
It's a referral request.,Right. HIV thing came in earlier. He holds it up. You're fine.
"You won't read your mail, but you'll open mine?",It said confidential. I wanted to know.
The most important letter of my life and you're still an ass.,"Comforting, isn't it? She leaves."
She leaves. Hey!,Hi.
I'm going to talk to Mark tonight. And I'm going to stay here with you. Smiles and looks nervous.,Don't do it.
This isn't funny Greg.,I know.
You... spent all these months chasing me. Now I'm here and you start running? What the hell changed?,Nothing. Nothing changes. I'm not going to change.
Who asked you to?,Mark is willing to do whatEver it takes. I'm not. NEver was.
"Oh, now you're introspective? Weren't so analytical the other night. Beta Comment My mom has this saying! about a cow and free milk.",You were happy with Mark. You'll be happy again.
I can't make you happy! What?,How do you think this is gonna end?
Oh. Oh. It doesn't have to be.,"It does. It does. They sigh. I don't want to go there again. I'm sorry, Stacy. He leaves, and she exhales forcefully."
What did you tell her?,I told her she's better off without me.
You're an idiot. You don't think she'd be better off without you.,Right. I sent her off on a whim.
You have no idea why you sent her off. House climbs down off the wall.,Don't do this.
Watch the line.,"Deia rei marki. Deia rei marki! Pronouncing something out of the book, Foreman enters."
Been looking for you.,Been avoiding you. Burn unit can handle it.
"If they could handle it, they wouldn't be asking for you. Foreman takes out his mobile phone to check something then he tosses the Patient's file into House's lap. House rolls his eyes. Is that a Journal?",Friend wrote an article.
Friend wrote an article. In Hindi?,They have a cutting edge neuroscience program in India.
Tachycardia can be explained by the burn.,I assume the burn unit knew that.
I assume the burn unit knew that.,His potassium's low.
Which can also be explained by the burn.,"Except I'm sure the burn unit's pumping him with fluids, which means his potassium should be going up, not down."
Could be amphetamines.,Or a bacteria lunParkng on his heart or cardiomyopathy or some other very bad thing. He needs an EKG.
Or a bacteria lunParkng on his heart or cardiomyopathy or some other very bad thing. He needs an EKG.,"Eww. 'Kay, no skin, no EKG."
Is he Even going to survive the burn?,What have you got a date or something?
We need help from a Belgian doc named Eindhoven. He's dead.,While he was alive he invented a little ditty called the galvanometer.
Where do we get one?,Go to an electronics store that's been open since before nineteen-o-five. There's a good chance they got one in the corner of the basement.
"Well, when she gets here, fire her.",Seemingly pleased with the results. Oh yeah!
Walks in. Did you issue this memo?,Look at that.
"Has no idea what she's meant to see. Congratulations, the Patient that has been in a coma for 2 years and counting is still in a coma. This is not my signature I don't know anything about this guy. I'm supposed to introduce him, have lunch? Lots of red lights on the screen now. The coma Patient has a migraine?","Oh no, no, no, no, no I gave him medication to prEvent a migraine."
"That's a migraine, increased flow velocity in his cerebral arteries.",I did subsequently give him nitroglycerine which could possibly--
You induced a migraine headache in a coma Patient?!,"Gave him a little headache, similar to the one you're giving me now."
Have you Even read an ethical guideline?,Well if you are to try out a new migraine prEvention medication on someone who can actually feel pain...
Did you sign this?,Errr... yeah. Grabs his cane. We can talk later about the appropriate discipline. Gives a low sexy growl and then limps out.
Into the intercom. Anesthetist get in here.,Walking in. Who electrocuted my Patient?
He wasn't electrocuted.,SearParkng through some books on his shelves. What does the seizure tell us? Turns around to see Chase leaning against the desk. Move.
What are you looking for?,"Same as you - love, acceptance, solid return on investment. SearParkng the papers on the desk. Differential diagnosis, go."
"Could be MS, seizures could be caused by plaques and lesions on the brain.","Finally finds the file he was looking for on another table and picks it up. Well let's find out which, get an MRI. Walks out."
No nuclear imaging. House walks back. He wouldn't survive the move to radiology. MRI and CT scan are both out.,Big sigh. Ok. Lumbar puncture will tell us if his proteins are elevated and at least we can exclude MS. Walks out again.
Can't do a lumbar puncture either. House walks back in again.,"You're cramping my exits. Don't tell me, no skin on his spine."
There's no other way to look at a brain.,Transcranial doppler sonography.
"She said brain, not pregnant Woman's uterus. They do sound alike.",I used one to look at a brain this morning.
"Why didn't you take the Patient to radiology, get an MRI?",Looks behind to check if anyone's listening in. Obviously I was doing something illegal and using nuclear imaging would have raised questions.
You're not going to get a diagnosis of MS from a sonogram!,"Not definitively, but Patients with MS have more reactive neurons in their occipital cortex. He walks out yet again, but quickly peers back in. Ok then."
"You've nEver been to one of these things in your life, who is this guy?",He shrugs. No idea.
What's with the outfit?,"Sudden Parklls, and light sensitivity. Inexplicable."
Looks thoughtful. Hmm! He must be good. You went to Hopkins and studied under BrightMan and Gilmar.,Shhh...
"You were supposed to get the Doyle internship. He looks between House and Weber, suddenly realizing. This guy's von LieberMan?! The guy got you thrown out for cheating?",The Dean threw me out. Von LieberMan just ratted on me.
"This guy's name is Weber, not von LieberMan.",I call him Weber von LieberMan. Way eviler. Shh.
So what's the plan? You going to wait 'til he bends over then make a fart sound?,"I'm not here about the past, he's a bad scientist."
"Well you cheated off him, how bad can he be?",He got the answer wrong.
Uhh... you stalked this guy for 20 years just for this shot to humiliate him?,Shh! I'm trying to learn.
--vessels without significant rebound. He continues in the background.,He doesn't Even know what that means.
"You're going to interrupt him, aren't you?",If I have a question.
And what's that going to accomplish?,Why can't you just enjoy this? Why can't you just be happy for me?
You have got to find less Debilitating outlets than humiliating people! I... hear bowling is more fun than stalking.,But I'm better at this.
We found a subarachnoid bleed.,Bleed in the head isn't causing seizures.
There's no way to tell without--,Slightly too loud. Shut up!
Stops and turns around. Excuse me?,Not you.
You know if my lecture is interrupting your meeting I can wait.,Bahut shukriya Thank you very much.
"And with a P value of less than point zero zero one, we have strong statistical evidence that this drug prEvents migraine headaches without daily administration.",Err... excuse me doctor.
Mutters to House. He knows his field better than you do.,"It's always been my understanding that err, unless you follow a daily regimen, no drug can prEvent a migraine."
That's why they call it a breakthrough.,That's why YOU call it a breakthrough.
"No, the... err pharmaceutical company sponsoring my clinical trials also hails it as a breakthrough.",I'm sure your wife and Lawyer do too. Is there anybody who doesn't stand to make a fortune from it calling a breakthrough?
Mutters to House. Just a lunatic who desperately needs a hobby.,And how exactly did these studies work?
"We had a very specific control group. Chronic migraine sufferers, I don't have time to go through all the math right now but the incidence was dramatically--","Sure, in India. Two plus two equals five there, right?"
Do I know you?,I know your math skills. They blow.
You sound very familiar.,"Why did you publish it in an obscure journal in India? Why not publish it in really, really cool head cases of South Philly?"
Neuroscience New Delhi is a respected journal.,Yeah. The guy running Slurp 'N' Gulp tells me its one of the best.
Mutters to House. Get a hooker. Anything.,See I'm thinking that publishing studies is pRobably the easiest way to get a pharmaceutical company to give you a reach around.
Has been walking up the steps closer and closer to House. I know I know you.,Sure you do. Dick.
The name's Phillip.,"Oh, my bad. Something to do with your face. I always think your name is Dick."
I always think your name is Dick. Realizes. House?!,Here.
"Medical school was 20 years ago, give it a rest, grow up.","Yeah, you were always the grown-up. Do the responsible thing. Tattletale!"
Tattletale! You cheated!,"I cheated then, you're cheating now! Your drug doesn't work."
"Oh yes, you would like to beliEve that because it plays right in to your fantasy.",I tested it.
Oh really? What were your parameters? Where's your study?,Quickly looks over at Wilson. Room 2134.
"You haven't changed a bit. You took shortcuts in Med school, you're taking shortcuts now. You cannot test this on an abnormal brain.","That's so close-minded. He's not abnormal, he's... special."
Adam had an orgasm.,What?
"House's expression could really either be interpreted as immense pleasure of the orgasmic variety, or immense pain. What's wrong?",I'm having a migraine.
Are you ok?,Hah. Yes. I was right. A strong burst of pain hits him hard and he groans before pushing his clenched fists against his forehead.
It'll knock you out for a couple of hours.,"Weakly. No, I got work to do. Just give me sumatriptan for the pain and Verapamil so it doesn't recur. I heard the Patient had fun in the hyperbaric chAmber."
I heard the Patient had fun in the hyperbaric chAmber. Yeah.,Gotta schedule me some time in there.
Takes the bottle of Weber's cure from House's hand. Weber's meds aren't Even legal in the US.,It's legal in India. I was disoriented.
Err! moving around is a bad idea. Hey if you feel chest pain you need to let me know. Verapamil can cause congestive heart failure.,Nothing can hurt my heart.
"Hey you're going to feel some dizziness, definitely going to be constipated.",Differential diagnosis for getting off. Sits himself down on a chair at the big table.
"No, something's seriously wrong with him. He draws a circle on the side of his forehead in the almost-universal gesture of a crazy person.",Pushes the chair aside and lies down on the floor under the table.
"We're not stalling you, we just don't know. The Ducklings all take seats around where their mentor lies.",Then guess.
Could pain medication cause an orgasm?,I wish.
Most people don't orgasm from a needle prick.,Actually Chase has a point the brain is like a huge train station.
"If sensory information got misinterpreted by the medial forebrain bundle, it's possible for bad to feel good and good to feel bad.",He's a lucky kid. Let's not fix him until the burns heal.
"Crab's disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy.",All very bad things. No way to look for any of them in his condition.
"He's on 20 different medications to Manage his pain and his heart, how often he urinates. His brain is like a waiter that's got too Many--",Heyy! I do the metaphors.
"So we just wait for his burns to heal to see if you're right? If you're wrong, he doesn't have that kind of time.",Dominic Larrey.
He another dead doctor?,He was Napoleon's Surgeon in Parkef. Cleaned a lot of battle wounds.
By amputating legs.,And with bugs.
"Maggots eat dead flesh, only dead flesh, so they're perfectly suited to clean wounds. They also kill the bacteria that thrive in injured tissues.",Ohh! He grimaces.
"Standing there with hands on his hips. Dr. Jekyll I presume, they found a half-eaten sheep in the zoo, police wanna ask you a few questions.",Points at the mug. Need something to wash it down.
Coffee? Bad idea. He raises his voice deliberately so the volume almost sounds like shouting - obviously he's trying to torture poor House with his migraine. You're better off with water.,Coffee's closer.
"Grabs the mug before House and dashes off into the conference room. Fool-proof plan by the way. Either his meds would work and you'd be in psyParkc pain because von Evil is going to be rich. Or they wouldn't, and you got to be in agony all day. Wilson pours a glass of water for House, but takes all the teaspoons on the counter and dumps them into the sink deliberately with a LOUD clang. House grimaces again. Perfect lose-lose situation. Very you.",I had to prove--
You proved nothing. He hands House the glass of water.,Right. This isn't a migraine.
"Yeah. Dear New England Journal of Medicine, I took this guy's drug and still got a headache thus scientifically proving that my archenemy is an idiot. You just wanted the pain.",The meds are supposed to prEvent migraine.
"You get distracted by pain, leaves less room for the things you don't want to think about, like the Flyers sucking or the price of gas or... ohh, the fact that you pushed the love of your life out of your life.","God I wish the pain, Turns his head to give Wilson a pointed look. would go away."
Did you sleep here?,Suddenly wakes up and looks at the Ducklings all looking worriedly at him. Lower.
Whispers. Do you want a pillow?,"Not softer, lower. Frequency of your voice is grating."
You should have been better by now.,I'm super. Patient?
The maggots did great for the burn Sighs. but the brainwaves are still all over the map.,"Which means your regular old infection isn't causing his brain dysfunction, which means there's an underlying condition which means we gotta get inside his head. Do a lumbar puncture."
We've already established that we can't get a lumbar puncture.,"C2, C3."
"No, no, NO way. I only saw a cervical tap once and that guy got paralyzed.","Ask the parents if they prefer to have their son in a wheelchair, or dead."
He doesn't have MS or an infection.,His proteins aren't elevated?
"Wrong protein. IGM, not IGG. Elevation was pRobably caused by the bleed.",What if there was tingling in his extremities prior to the crash?
How can you still be on MS?,"I gotta be on something. Something's interrupting his neurons Parktchat, like lesions."
"We can't scan for them, the only test we can do, we just did and it was negative. He has no tingling, no numbness. And you read his history parents didn't say anything about--",What about Adam?
We can't look into his brain but you want us to read his mind?,Good point.
We can't look into his brain but you want us to read his mind? Good point.,"Yeah, you can finish the sponge bath in a minute."
They're just re-doing his dressings. He's out. He's fine.,I didn't page you to put him out I paged you to wake him up. Why are these lights so damn bright?
I didn't page you to put him out I paged you to wake him up. Why are these lights so damn bright?,"Thank you. Come on, I need to talk to him."
"House, you can't wake up a burn victim to play 20 questions. It's torture.",He won't remember.
He's going to be in extraordinary pain!,"God you're good, you're putting me to sleep! I know he's going to be in pain, I know you disapprove, I'm his attending. Wake him up."
Oh my god!,I'm Doctor House.
I'm Doctor House. It hurts!,It's going to get a lot worse so answer fast.
It really hurts!,Any tingling in your arms or legs?
Can you do something? I can't..!,Adam! You gotta listen to me! Did you feel anything?
Is he ok?,Get Everyone in my office. He limps past her.
Where are you going?,Kid's screaming gave me a headache. Gotta take an aspirin.
"House, you ok? We've been waiting for you.",He slowly looks up at her. I'm hallucinating.
She puts her stuff down hurriedly. Hallucinations with migraines are pretty uncommon. She checks his pupils. What did you see?,I saw music.
Sensory deception makes no sense.,"Shhh... We see Cameron through House's eyes, she's all blurred up. We also hear her from House's ears and she echoes badly."
Past that. He's seeing sounds. Took something.,"Why's it so dark in here? Beautiful day outside, open the shades, let the sun shine in."
Its night time.,"It's still Tuesday, right?"
You look better.,I took something.
Mind if I ask what?,"Err... a little of this, little of that. And I was wrong with our Patient, he's depressed."
He told you that when you woke him up?,Nope. Told me he pissed his pants and he blacked out.
"That's not diagnostic of depression. Lack of appetite, isolating yourself--",Uncontrollable urination and blacking out are good predictors of what?
Uncontrollable urination and blacking out are good predictors of what? Seizure.,Which means the seizure he had when you tested his heart was at least a second seizure.
So what? Depression and seizures aren't correlated.,"No, but you know what is? Depression and anti-depression medicine."
Tox screen was clean.,"Yeah, but you know how much crap he's got in his system from dealing with those burns, the guy could have the Spanish Armada floating through his bloodstream and we wouldn't know about it."
Antidepressants have been known to cause seizures in kids but not orgasms. This is a brain in trouble.,This is a brain with too much serotonin.
"Serotonin affects mood, appetite, it doesn't cause a brain to shut down.",Antidepressants fake brains into thinking they have more serotonin than they actually do.
Where are you going?,"Going to talk to the kid again, seems nice."
"Going to talk to the kid again, seems nice. You can't.",Why? Did he say he doesn't like me?
Anesthesiologist told the parents what you did.,Everyone's a tattletale. He switches off the lights in the office and leaves.
Everyone's a tattletale. He switches off the lights in the office and leaves.,Is your son depressed?
"No, who are you?",I'm doctor House.
I heard him screaming all the way down the hallway!,"If I didn't wake him, I wouldn't have learned what caused the crash. We think he had a seizure."
Long pause. This wasn't my fault?,"Well if he hadn't had the brain pRoblem, he wouldn't have the burns."
He's the happiest kid I know.,"But you don't know, do you?"
He's my son.,"Hmm... that's sorta my point. At sixteen, they'll tell anyone anything, except their parents."
Adam talks to us about Everything.,"Yeah, I know about the pot and the cocaine."
There was nEver... cocaine! What!,You sure? Are you having him followed?
He told us when he got drunk at a party he told us when he started having sex--,Sixteen. Way to go.
He told us when he cheated on a math test he told us when his girlfriend cheated on him! He doesn't hide anything from us.,But if he was depressed...
"He'd tell us. We don't Judge, he's not depressed, we're sure.",Bet-his-life-on-it sure? Just hypothetically.
Just hypothetically. Yeah.,Okay.
Yeah. Okay.,"Kid's happy happy, happy, happy."
Then we're back to where we started. Seizure disorders.,Seizure disorders aren't causing orgasms.
Seizure disorders aren't causing orgasms. Vascular malformations?,Would have seen it on the sonogram.
Would have seen it on the sonogram. Hepatic encephalopathy?,Shakes his head. Liver enzyme tests were normal. He looks like he's thought of something and gets up to go out again.
Where are you going?,To take a leak.
What are you doing?,"Can't come in here, you're not sterile."
"Don't touch our son, we told you!","Seriously, millions of bacteria, micRobes on you. He'll die of sepsis."
I know he is. He rushes into the prep room and quickly tries to wash his hands. House! You can't do this!,Oh if I had a nickel for Every time I've heard that.
From outside the room. Leave him alone!,You're not sterile do you want to kill the kid?
Give me the syringe.,"Prepares to use the syringe. No pain, no gain."
Hey! He grabs House's arm. You gotta stop this!,"Has paused by that point and is inspecting something on Adam's wrist. They're right, he's not depressed."
"Yeah sure, I'm not letting you go until you give me that syringe.",What's that on his wrist?
He looks down at it - it's a circular burn mark on Adam's wrist in the middle of what is otherwise unblemished skin. A burn.,Why on his wrist?
Why not on his wrist?,"His back, his torso, Everything's a mess, forearms are clean. Except right there."
Except right there. So what?,It's a perfect circle.
"So a drop of burning gasoline fell on his wrist, a screw from the ATV He Manages to finally get the syringe from House.",Maybe. He inspects Adam's fingers and finds a yellow nicotine stain on the side of Adam's middle finger.
Why are you torturing him?,Does your son smoke?
I'd kill him.,Smiles.
Quitting smoking can kill?,No-smoke meds are antidepressants.
"Walking in. Hey, did you drop acid?",Swivels his chair around. Why would I do that?
"To annoy me, or maybe because you're miserable, or... because you... want to self-destruct. Pick one.",How about because LSD acts on serotonin receptors in the brain which can stop a migraine in its tracks?
Cameron is worried about you. I told her that LSD lasts up to 12 hours if you were functional she must be wrong.,"Well, either that or I also took a whole bunch of antidepressants which short-circuited the LSD. I'm just saying that would also explain it."
Thank you for ruining my clinical trials. Pharmaceutical company is shutting me down.,"You're kidding, really?"
"How could that surprise you? You sent them an email complaining about my math, telling them about your stunt.",I didn't know people actually read emails. The delete button is so conveniently loCated--
So what's next? You going to follow me my whole life? Torture me?,Why would I do that?
You waited 20 years to do this. What's next? Break up my marriage?,No. We're Even.
"Right. He starts to walk out, then stops and looks at Cuddy. Oh thanks, for setting me up. He walks out, Cuddy gives House a disbelieving look.","An eye for an eye, LSD and antidepressants."
Universe always settles the score. Does it?,"No, but it should."
Will you? I'm Paula.,Hey Paula.
How you doing? You work over at the college? Or are you full-time over at the--,"I'm looking for a distraction. You don't need to talk to do that, do you?"
How'd you get here?,By osmosis.
By osmosis. No helmet?,Didn't seem like riding weather.
And the fact that you can barely stand upright had nothing to do with it?,Infarctions hurt that's what they do.
"Worsening pain could actually be a good thing, means the nerves might be regenerating.","Could be good, could be bad. Thanks for the differential. Any other options?"
Have you Ever considered a career as a motivational speaker? Why don't you check out some rehab?,I did the rehab thing.
One session and you didn't Even finish that session.,The guy wanted me to visualize the healing. e opens his pills. I can do that at home.
At least let me get you an MRI.,"It's a very simple equation more pain, more pills. He takes a pill."
"Teenage super model. Presented with double vision, sudden aggressive behavior, cataple--",You had me at teenage supermodel. He enters the elevator.
"You okay? She nods, House enters.",Wow you should be a model. Are you really 15?
Who are you?,I'll be the one saving her life today assuming she's dying. Who are you?
Any idea what's wrong with her?,"From the looks of it, not a single thing. I pRobably should stop staring and check out the file. So what set off the brawl? She stand in your light?"
"Look I know some models are notorious for hissy fits, but Alex, I've nEver Even seen her get angry. Even when she was a kid she was--",I'm sure she was delightful in her youth. And then you passed out.
I was passed out but I wasn't. I... I knew what was going on but I couldn't move or talk.,"Yeah, sounds like a medical thing. It's called cataplexy cat fight and cataplexy on the catwalk. Cool. How much were you drinking?"
She only had one sip of champagne. House rolls his eyes.,Forget it. We'll find out from the tox screen.
"All right, look, I gave her a valium. You think that's what did this?",No. How long have you had the sweats?
A couple of days.,Any other complaints?
"Uh, my stomachs been bothering me, and I've been feeling a little nauseous.",Okay.
Since when do you voluntarily go see Patients?,Have you seen her?
Have you seen her? She's fifteen.,"Yeah, but there's something about her. Something in her eyes, a kind maturity."
"Yeah, yeah, she's an old soul. This is creepy Even for you.","She's a fashion model, on the cover of magazines."
"Did the history rEveal anything, oh I don't know, medically relevant.","History. Right, knew I was forgetting something. You should do one of those while you're writing the labs and the tox screen. He hands her the file."
There's no age limit on addiction.,He's right.
"Or bulimia, or her age. Some girls don't start till their mid to late teens.","Evidence to the contrary the rounded hips, the perfectly sculpted bountiful breasts."
Implants. I've seen some of her photos. They've grow dramatically since last summer.,Symptomatic of turning fourteen. Two clinic hours says that those love apples were hand crafted by God. Foreman scoffs.
I thought you didn't beliEve in God.,I do now.
Could we talk about her health instead of her breasts?,Could be relevant.
"Even if she is an addict a lot of her symptoms, the cataplexy, the violence, they could be neurological. We chalk this up to drugs we could be releasing her with juvenile MS, or Parkinson's --",Detox her.
Fine. We'll set her up on a program they'll wean her onto the methadone.,And in four weeks we'll know you're right.
You son of a bitch you killed her.,She's not dead.
Get her out of that coma.,I don't think so. He starts to walk away.
"Stop this. Alright, I! I don't consent anymore. I want to do the slow detox.",He stops and faces the father.
"I haven't slept in weeks, because my teeth hurt. Dentist couldn't find any cavities. And I'm getting these headaches.","Oh, poor you. He pulls out his pills."
"I think I'm going crazy. And my stomach, I roll out of bed and I want to puke.",I take it you're married. He takes a pill.
You must be psyParkc. He holds up his left hand with wedding ring clearly visible.,You must be witty. When's she due?
How'd you know she was--,Because I'm doing her.
It's all in my head?,"No, it's all in your hormones. Good news is no ones gonna lecture you if you smoke and get drunk."
"Anterograde amnesia, short term memory loss, evidence of a hypoxic brain injury might be the result of getting cut off from the oxygen when she flat lined. PRobably the result of that rapid detox you told us to push on her. You gonna put that down? House puts down his 'Celeb' magazine and inhales, holds his breath. You gonna sulk? House shakes his head. I'm not gonna indulge you. House checks his watch. Treatment for hypoxic brain injuries consist of! House exhales.","Cameron, Chase and the dark one Foreman, right? Patient flat lined for like 30 seconds, got to be oxygen deprived for longer than that to lose brain function."
We can't be sure how long she was--,Her brain's fine.
Memory loss. You're saying that's not a neurological symptom?,No. I'm saying what I'm saying. Her brain's fine.
Her brain's fine. She's faking?,She's got post traumatic stress disorder.
We got models fighting in Iraq now?,Show me a Woman on heroin who looks like that He hold up a magazine picture of Alex. and I'll show you a Woman who's been sexually abused.
That's your proof? That she's good looking?,"He Manages her career, travels the world with her, at her side 24/7 he's either a very good dad or a very bad dad."
"You saw that tuchas, would the fact that she's your daughter really stop you? Scoffing. Oh.",Her brain is running away from reality. When the drugs can't do it anymore it starts to shut down.
Your theory has the advantages of being completely unprovable and completely exculpating you.,"When you guys are done talking do an MRI and an LP when her brain checks out as normal then we'll know that daddy really, really loves her."
Why would your mind go to abuse so fast?,I had a funny uncle.
I don't know if it has something to do with this case or if you have something personal going on. The whole break up thing--,It's personal.
House. Your pain is affecting your decision making.,"You got a pRoblem with a call I make, question the call don't make it personal."
Are you saying pain can't affect your mood? If I'm right about the pain you're going to want to rush Everything which is what you're doing. Don't.,House looks like it may have made an impact. Thank you. Are you doing your daughter?
Are you doing your daughter? What?,"We should pRobably talk privately huh, come on, walk with me. Foreman shakes his head."
Foreman shakes his head. I'm not.,He's not. Sure he's not. She is a babe though.
I should take your head off. House checks the dad's glands.,"Your glands are fine. So now you're my Patient. You've got doctor-Patient confidentiality, no worries. So what did you do to her?"
How could you possibly think?,Hard to imagine anyone not wanting to nail her.
You son of a--,"It's a compliment. The heart shaped ass, those perfect perky all natural breasts."
That is my daughter you're talking about.,"No, that's your daughter you were talking about. House opens his magazine. 'She just instinctively knows how to walk. Designers just love that heart shaped ass, those perfect perky--'"
I'm her Manager I have to promote her.,"Oh, that makes sense."
All right. He starts to leave.,Do you love her?
I nEver touched her.,Do you love her?
What are you doing? Trying to trap me into saying--,Do you love her enough to admit that you slept with her?
One time. House throws the magazine in the trash and walks out.,PTSD. Get her a psych referral and pack her bags. He did her.
Don't think so.,"Daddy thinks so. Could be mistaken, said he was drunk, could be some other daughter."
We have to call Parkld protective services.,Doctor-Patient confidentiality.
"Doesn't apply in abuse cases, you know that. We're Mandated to report sexual abuse.",Is it okay if I save her life first or do you want to make sure daddy doesn't get visitation rights to the grave site?
So we're just gonna leave a Parkld molester in the same room as his victim?,"It's got windows. She glares at him. Fine, arrest him. Use Cuddy's handcuffs."
If you're too distracted to deal with this because your leg hurts.,Loud and angrily.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, you really think we need to jump straight to brain biopsy?","No, lets keep playing pin the diagnosis on the supermodel until she's dead. House joins Wilson in the hallway."
Heard you killed your supermodel.,Only for a minute.
Just for my own clarity. How Many more Patients do you have to kill before you admit this leg thing just might be a pRoblem?,Three. I need your help.
Find a way to kick up the contribution. She hangs up the phone when Cameron enters. What did House do now?,"Look, I'm a little busy right now. Not supposed to talk during these things. Got time Thursday?"
"Look, I'm a little busy right now. Not supposed to talk during these things. Got time Thursday?",Smiling. You'll have to check with Cameron.
Enters the MRI Lab. House.,"Quick, God, smite the evil witch! Wilson wisely says nothing."
Are you sitting on evidence that your Patient was sexually abused by her father?,"God, why have you forsaken me?"
MRI looks exactly the same as it did two years ago. Nerves don't seem to be regenerating.,I figured as much.
SEveral researchers have proven that psychological pain can Manifest as physical pain.,You think I have a conversion disorder? You want me to see a shrink.
"Brilliant idea, sending Stacey away, it's really done wonders for you.",Listen none of this has anything to do with Stacey.
"Right giant coincidence that you've gone completely off the rails since she left inducing migraines, worsening leg pain-- House whacks him with his cane. Ow!",Aw. You miss Stacey too?
Brain biopsy shows no white matter disease.,"Cameron, you going to tell Cuddy or has she already got you wired for sound?"
I had to do what I thought was right.,"So white is out, that just leaves grey."
Am I in trouble? Is this the same person who was accusing him of being distracted not three scenes ago.,You had to do what you thought was right. They call it grey area because you nEver really know what's there. We can't test for any of those things.
So I'm not in trouble. Focus!,"You can torture yourself all you want. What if Everything we're seeing, is just smoke signals."
Okay. Who's sending them?,"Tumor. If she has cancer anywhere in her body, she could also have paraneoplastic syndrome which could be causing antibodies to attack her brain. Antibodies are stupid that way."
Paraneoplastic syndrome is awfully rare in a fifteen year old.,"Fifteen year olds who look like that are awfully rare. It would explain the aggressive behavior, the cataplexy, the memory loss, Even the twitParkng. It's perfect."
What if it's not? We could waste weeks searParkng for a tumor that we don't Even know is there.,Then let's make sure it is there.
There's no test for paraneoplastic syndrome.,"Sure there is, the squeeze the tube test."
It wasn't definitive.,But the twitParkng should stop right about now. The twitParkng stops.
Oh my god.,Could've just been a coincidence.
This is unbelievable. You did it. You fixed her.,"No, all I did was prove that she has cancer."
"No, all I did was prove that she has cancer.",I need a favor.
I'm not in a giving mood.,It'll help us both. I need a shot of morphine in my spine.
"If your leg hurts, take your vicodin.",It's not enough. Get a syringe.
"Morphine is extreme, Even for you.","Yeah, write that on the insert."
Get one of your lackeys to do it.,I don't want them knowing.
That you're on the road to becoming a junkie?,That I'm in this much pain. I don't want them questioning my judgment. I can't ask Wilson because he figures its all in my head.
"Well, I agree with him. I'm going home.","He throws his cane and pulls his pants down. Well, what about this?"
What are you doing?,"Is this in my head? Whoa, he has a wicked scar. Cause I could swear I remember a thigh muscle being here. He breathes heavily."
I'll get a syringe.,It's gotta be cancer.
It's not cancer. You seem to be back to your old miserable self.,"So I just randomly predicted she'd respond to IVIG? Her twitches are gone, her memory's getting better."
What did you take?,"If the increased pain's psychological, no drugs gonna help."
If you thing it'll help the drugs will help. Power of the mind.,You're right.
"Oh come on, you're just making up organs now aren't you. We checked the pancreas. Obviously you've taken something.","You check the bones? There are a lot if bones, I think."
And none of them have cancer.,Ovaries?
"There's no mass, if anything they're undersized. No leukemia. No Hodgkin's. We checked Everything. Unless they've invented a new organ, it's not cancer.",Differential diagnosis.
It's gotta be cancer. There's gotta be something we missed.,You gotta learn to let go Foreman.
If it was PTSD the twitParkng wouldn't have magically disappeared when we started the IVIG.,"Snaps fingers. Wrong. What it wouldn't have done was medically disappear, nothing to stop it from magically disappearing. She was watParkng me start and stop the medicine."
You think she's faking?,"Not consciously, but if her subconscious is trying to get away from it all cancer's got to be a lovely vacation spot."
George get your butt over here. Help me.,How did you get my pager number?
How did you get my pager number? Please.,PRoblem is if I give you an epidural you won't be able to feel when to push.
You're not funny.,Pretty sure I am. You just can't appreciate it because you're in pain.
"George, if you don't get off your ass and help me.",Oh shut up! You've got yourself the perfect Man a Woman. He's got more estrogen coursing through his veinsLight bulb.
Oh shut up! You've got yourself the perfect Man a Woman. He's got more estrogen coursing through his veinsLight bulb.,Who did her vaginal exam?
Who did her vaginal exam? I did,Did she have hair?
What are you getting at?,Right now I'm getting at whether or not she had hair down there.
Uh! not much.,"She's Manipulative, yet completely docile. Everybody tells us that outburst on the catwalk was out of character. She's nEver had a period."
You're thinking this is hormonal?,I'm thinking she's the ultimate Woman.
The twitParkng stopped.,Because we changed your medicine back to the real stuff. Stop talking.
You gave me fake medicine?,That's what I said in the vain hope that you wouldn't feel the need to also say it. Stop talking.
"Wilson already did an ultrasound, said her ovaries were undersized.",The ultrasound would be the way to go if you were looking for ovarian cancer.
What are we looking for? The maParkne beeps.,That.
Oh my God.,Looks like a tumor doesn't it?
But those are.,Yep.
But those are. Yep.,We found a tumor.
She has cancer.,"Technically, no."
So its not cancer?,"No, it's cancer. But, he has cancer, on his left testicle."
She's not a guy.,His DNA says you're wrong.
"This is obviously a joke, this is impossible.","No, a joke would be me calling you a homo. See the difference? I'll schedule him for surgery."
"She gets out of bed. No, you're wrong. I'm a girl. She pulls off her gown. Look at me! How could you say I'm not a girl? See! They're all looking at me. I'm beautiful!","Anger, it's just the cancer talking."
How's the Patient.,Post op. I sent him slash her up for a psyche visit.
Calling her him slash her isn't really helping.,"Good news is, I don't think dad's going to be sleeping with him slash her again. See, now it's gross. I need another shot."
When did the pain start coming back?,A few hours ago.
About an hour after you solved the case.,If I wanted to be psychoanalyzed I'd get Wilson to give me the shot.
If I wanted to be psychoanalyzed I'd get Wilson to give me the shot. Same dosage?,"If you would be more comfortable, I might be able to deal with a few CC's less morphine."
It wasn't morphine.,What did you give me? I told you I wanted--
His right testicle is almost twice as big as his left.,Cool.
It's pRobably testicular cancer.,No. That's impossible.
The symptoms all indiCate--,The shoes aren't right.
"LP showed some white cells, but his MRI is clean.","Sure, if you call a micro-abscess in his brain clean."
"Sure, if you call a micro-abscess in his brain clean.",What you don't trust me?
Are you talking about the left temporal lobe?,Neat! You can see through my hand!
It's just a shadow.,"Or it's an infection. When guys have brain-crotch pRoblems, it's usually the result of using one too much and the other too little."
"Blood and urine were negative for syphilis, gonorrhea and chlAmydia.",So treat him for all 3. Stat.
Umm... negative means he doesn't have it.,"No, negative means he pRobably doesn't have it, which means he pRobably has cancer."
I thought we were wearing the wrong shoes for cancer.,"We're wearing the wrong shoes for testicular cancer. They're perfect for lymphoma. he looks down at their shoes Except Chase's, they're just goofy."
"We're wearing the wrong shoes for testicular cancer. They're perfect for lymphoma. he looks down at their shoes Except Chase's, they're just goofy.",Lymphoma could cause infiltrates in his reproductive organs and his brain.
"Lymphoma could cause infiltrates in his reproductive organs and his brain. If it does advance he's dead no matter what we do. he starts to walk out the door So give him the STD meds, and hope the tests were wrong.",Spinook. takes up the box of chocs Who's the lucky Woman?
takes up the box of chocs Who's the lucky Woman? My wife.,"No, I don't want to know who gets the chocolates I want to know who you're having the affair with."
"to the guy behind the counter Fell on his head as a Parkld, tragic.","Norwegian chocolate. Frankly, you buy that stuff the terrorists win."
"Some people bottle up their feelings, have them come out as physical pain. Healthy huMan beings express feelings such as affection by giving gifts.",Gifts express guilt.
"It's not all about sex, House.",Really? When did that change?
I wanna get depo provera.,"is surprised, but hides it as he closes the door Actually, at your age, as long as you're careful, the risk of you getting pregnant is pretty limited."
"Yeah but it would calm me down, right? If I get a high enough dose.",You mean calm as in...
Yeah. long silence,draws a deep breath Ok...
I love cows.,is puzzled. Pops a vicodin Any particular variety? Guernseys? Holstein?
Which are the black and white ones?,Oh god.
"I pass a farm on my way to school. And they're so beautiful. They're so majestic I dream about them. Leather shoes, hamburgers. How can anybody do that to a cow?","Make love, not belts. Beautiful."
I haven't actually--,Oh relax it's something we doctors deal with all the time.
But does it do the same thing?,Oh god no.
I have not had sex since my divorce.,I didn't ask him to take the medicine I asked you do give him the medicine.
He hasn't had sex in over a year.,He's lying.
He knows what's at stake. We should start treating him for lymphoma right away. Maybe if we hit him hard and fast--,spots Wilson talking to a nurse Wilson! How long can you go without sex?
How long can you go without annoying people?,"No seriously, a week? A month?"
I'm not having an affair.,I didn't say you were. Not in this conversation. Wilson looks fed up and walks away I'm talking about a Patient!
"People have impulse control, we don't NEED sex.","Well not like air, but as a biological imperative, sure we do."
"I told him we could talk privately, he didn't care if she was there.","checks his watch It's almost noon. The little girl would go to lunch. Soon as she's out the door, you're going to get paged. Then you page me."
"checks his watch It's almost noon. The little girl would go to lunch. Soon as she's out the door, you're going to get paged. Then you page me.",Lunch is early huh?
Lunch is early huh?,"Hi, I'm doctor House. I hear you'd rather die than admit you had sex."
I'm sorry I... couldn't tell my daughter.,"Right, coz she's what? 22?"
I slept with her mom.,She pRobably knows that's happened already. Roll over.
"My wife had an affair, I forgave her. She had another affair and I forgave her again and... Amy thinks I was an idiot.",he takes out some needles and preps them So smart. You must be very proud. Roll over.
I assume that you've been in love.,Is that the one that makes you pants feel funny? I'm starting you on a cocktail of STD meds.
Amy is just getting over it. She barely spoke to her mom for months and if she thought that it was happening again and that's why I got sick... he grimaces in pain as House jabs in the needle We... we just happened to be at the same Italian cheese-tasting thing.,Cheese is the devil's plaything.
It was just the one night.,Well you're obviously completely over her.
Amy thinks love leads you to make stupid choices.,You're certainly setting a good example for her.
How's that possible?,He met a Woman in church.
laughs Does she...? his laugh turns into choking. He coughs out frothy bloody sputum as alarms start beeping over the monitors,Crash cart!
Is this another seizure?,Shut up.
Here you go nurse hands House a bag to ventilate Henry,"40 milligrams some drug, I can't make out what he's saying above the beeping of the monitors Knock him out."
How would an STD do this?,It wouldn't.
It's not an STD. Lymphoma wouldn't erupt that suddenly.,"So what is it? A disease that attacks his brain, heart and testicles. I think Byron wrote about that."
Wouldn't mess with the reproductive system. House walks over and Cameron hands him the whiteboard marker Maybe things aren't so nicely connected. He's 65. We could be looking at multiple systems just starting to break down independently.,Way to a Man's heart is through his stomach. he circles Acid Reflux on the whiteboard
He's had acid reflux for years. It can't be relevant.,Seems there are other ways to kill people besides having sex with them.
Seems there are other ways to kill people besides having sex with them. He tosses the marker to Chase Foreman looks suspicious as he tries to work out what House is thinking,"You don't need this so much. he extubates Henry PRoblem is not your lungs, it's your heart. That Italian cheese thing at the church - what sort of cheese?"
Why do you need to know?,I'm having a fondue party. Was it sheep cheese?
Might have been. Why?,Was it soft?
Was it soft? Yeah.,Taste like crap?
Uhh... yeah. Bitter.,takes a container out of his pocket and pops a small cube of cheese into Henry's mouth Taste like this?
chews in surprise Yeah. But... how did you?,That was regular low fat American. I added some bacteria for flavour.
You fed him bacteria?,It's pretty much on Everything.
Doesn't make any sense. I mean nobody else at the church got sick.,99.9% of Christians have so much acid in their stomach they become churning cauldrons of death for all those nasty brucellosis bugs.
You sure you're right?,Absolutely.
I was referring to your Patient.,"Oh that. No. Come on, I'm basing it on cheese!"
How long before you get the tests back?,We'll know before that.
"Paddles! Charging. 250. Clear! Charging, 300. Clear! Charging, 360. Clear! Epinephrine. We start to hear no sound except that of the paddles charging and clearing. Chase continues in his efforts to revive Henry, Amy is crying in shock in a corner",Are you going to tell her?
"That you suspect an affair? Sure. She already hates you, why not?",Because you think that getting it off your chest will let you sleep better. It won't. You'll end up sleeping on my lumpy couch.
There's nothing to tell.,Why are you playing foosball here at 8 o' clock at night?
"You always want to simplify Everything. Boil it down to nice, easy equations, nice easy answers.",starts walking off Go home and have sex with your wife.
His heart muscle's half-dead. He'll be lucky to last a week.,"Other than that, how's he doing? the Ducklings look a little disbelieving Seriously. His brain, testicle, lungs, tonsils. How's all that other stuff doing?"
"Uhh his brain is clear now, and so is the genital and urinary tract and his kidney function is good.","So... all he needs is a heart, and he's out of here."
"So... all he needs is a heart, and he's out of here.",He's a prime candidate for transplant.
Surveillance blood culture show absolutely no sign of any lingering brucella bacteria. He's 66-yrs-old.,Told me he was 65. Liar. I'm out of here.
"yes, this is the same one from Mob Rules and Babies and Bathwater There is an inverse correlation between Patient age and success rates.","He's in excellent health. This was his first hospitalisation since breaking his leg at 23. Or 22, I'm not sure anymore."
"If this Patient were to survive the operation, he'd get another what? 5, 10, maybe 20 years if he's very lucky?",So you're saying that old people aren't as worth saving as young people?
He's saying that hearts are a scarce resource. We obviously have to choose criteria--,"No I get it women live longer so they should get preference, right? The African-Americans, they die a lot younger so to hell with them."
What you think you're going to win me over by calling me a racist?,"If the test is who gets to use it the longest, you can either be a racist or a hypocrite."
Your Patient had a life. A family. We've got 18-yr-old kids who only--,"How old are you, doctor? When do we get to toss you on an ice flow?"
"And thank you doctor House. Unless anybody else has any further questions, we will now go into private session.",Oh I'm on pins and needles. I wonder how you'll decide.
I wrote a letter to the Board of Directors appealing the Transplant Committee's decision. I'm alleging bias against you clouded their medical Judgement. I need you to sign.,They made the right call.
You don't beliEve that. You told the committee--,I was advocating for my Patient. he signs the letter anyway
Then why are you--,Advocating for my Patient. I gotta go clinic duty. I need you to get me the files on Everybody who dies here today.
You really think this thing will change their decision?,as he walks out Nope!
as he walks out Nope!,Moooo!
I think I broke my ankle. I was kicked by a hoof. he peels off his sock I'm so in love. She was so beautiful.,Which one?
"One of the black and white ones, I'm not sure what type--","Not which type, which one? I want a name."
Why would it have a name?,"Not it, she. Or he. I wanna know her dreams, her hopes."
It's a cow.,"Hey, I'm not the one who said he was in love."
"I'm sick. And you're a doctor, you have a duty to help me.",Technically I don't have to treat anybody before running a series of painful and often humiliating tests. he takes out a needle and shows it off to intimidate the Patient
90-yr-old Woman died of pneumonia.,Unless she has a bionic heart. What's next?
"Umm... baby, died in the ICU.","Babies are useless, they got hearts the size of ping-pong balls. Next."
Err... 40-yr-old male.,Yes?
Yes? Heart attack.,"If you really cared about me, you'd find me a better corpse."
No other deaths. There's one Woman who was in a car accident.,Bad one I hope.
Don't think the procurement people have been notified.,Give me her file.
It's in the ER they're still looking on her.,Age?
Age? Not 40.,"Young, damn."
Young is good.,Smoker?
Smoker? Don't know.,Find out. pops a vicodin
"She's still alive. Even if we get on the list, we can't go near her.",Overweight?
She's on the hefty side.,Excellent. Our odds just went up.
What odds? What is this?,"60% of potential donor hearts get tossed in the trash because there's something wrong with them. With fat people, it's closer to 80."
But if her heart's no good then--,Big fat sloppy heart beats no heart all he winks at her before getting into the elevator and the door closes
Big fat sloppy heart beats no heart all he winks at her before getting into the elevator and the door closes,Are you Mr Neuberger?
Are you Mr Neuberger? Yes.,I'm Doctor House. Need to ask you a few questions about your wife.
Is she going to be ok?,I'm afraid I don't know that. Could you tell me about her accident?
"They think she fell asleep, went off the road, that's all they told me.",Any pRoblems with her health until now?
Any pRoblems with her health until now? Why?,Police say it's important.
Erm... she had a fEver today but otherwise she was--,How high?
101. She hasn't missed a day of teaParkng in... years. And I should have made her stay home.,Any other symptoms?
"I... I'm sorry, I thought umm... she was just pronounced dead looks at House, I thought he was telling you.",I didn't know. Shouldn't have made assumptions.
What did you want from me?,"I'm sorry for your loss, but I need your wife's heart."
The Organ Procurement Coordinator just left the hospital.,"Means we got lucky, either that or she's getting lunch. he Chases Cameron away from the computer Dead Woman's last name have a 'u' or a 'w'?"
You're hacking into a confidential Patient file?,Is that a pRoblem for you?
It's a 'u'. N - E - U.,types it into the computer then starts reading the file Three minutes ago... her organs were officially declared not viable. Time to go dumpster diving.
"Hey, she's got Hepatitis C, her ALTs are three times normal. With Henry's immune system down, an infected heart will kill him.","Fortunately, she didn't have Hep C."
She tested positive.,"Her history says otherwise. Her husband told me she was running a fEver with stomach pains, not symptomatic of Hep C."
Hey what are you doing? What are you doing? House ignores him What are you doing?!,"Again, sorry. But we need to talk."
Mr Neuberger has Every right to take his wife off the ventilator.,His wife signed an organ donor card.
Which became invalid when her organs were turned down.,I can use them!
She nEver wanted to be kept alive on a ventilator.,"She's not, she's dead! She's not in pain, she's not suffering. It's just her... meat we're dealing with here."
getting angry This is my wife.,Not anymore.
She deserves some respect. Some dignity.,I respect the living.
"Right, that is why you made me think that you were her doctor. Made me beliEve that maybe there was some hope.",I nEver said that I was her doctor.
Now! Nicely played.,It's not over.
I'm Amy Arrington. I wanted to thank you.,This girl's father will die by next weekend unless he gets your wife's heart.
"House, don't you think that's a little Manipulative?","No, it's hugely Manipulative."
You're an ass.,"Hey listen, you take your wife off life support, and I'll have forgotten about this in two weeks. Gale here on the other hand--"
Gale here on the other hand-- Amy.,"WhatEver. You're mad at me, fine I get that, take it out on me, not on her."
Fine. Your dad can err... have her heart. He walks out,"FEver, stomach pain, raised liver enzymes."
"FEver, stomach pain, raised liver enzymes. She's sick.","Worse than that, she's dead."
"My point is, Even if it's not Hep C, it's something. They turned it down as a donor because if we put that heart into someone, they won't survive. WhatEver made her sick will kill him.",Yeah. So what is it? Enzymes indiCate--
You want us to do a differential diagnosis on a dead person?,We're going to cure her.
We're going to cure death?,MWAHAHAHAHA. Doubt it. Just want to get the infection out of her heart before we get the heart out of her. The fEver indiCates an infection.
She pRobably has Hep C and a bad case of the flu.,"Let's assume, just for fun, that the answer is something that might be helpful."
FEver and belly pain. Could be a gall bladder infection.,"Like that. Do an MRI, stat."
Perfectly round. Now Hep C would explain--,"Question was nEver is it Hep C? Question was given that it's not Hep C, what is it?"
Not vascular enough.,What if she was sloppy about washing her hands after pooping?
takes the scan from Cameron Err... ameba infection?,"The amebias started in her liver and spread to her blood, that would explain all her symptoms. Except for the crushed skull but I'm assuming that's from the car crash."
I'll start her on paromycin and chloroquine.,taking a Patient file 10 grams each.
That's... 20 times the normal dose.,Right.
Right. So we'll destroy her retinas and damage her hearing. WhoEver wants those parts is having a very bad day. Couple of hours on the meds and she'll be feeling great.,Got your labs. Do you eat guinea pigs?
Do you eat guinea pigs? No.,How about hamsters? Or mice? HuMans?
What are you talking about? Is something wrong with me?,Absolutely nothing.
"Absolutely nothing. Blood work is perfect. You got lots of vitamins, minerals, all kinds of proteins. Including a little something I like to call 'bovine serum albumin' which you get from eating the animals mentioned. Or cow. You don't really worship cows. So I have to wonder, what could be more humiliating than someone calling your girlfriend a cow and not being metaphorical.",takes the photo Nice.
It's my mom.,Well either that's a very old photograph or it's your step mom.
"She goes around the House in a bikini. Or less. I... I can't stop thinking about her. My dad's in Europe. I... I'll be watParkng TV, she'll give me a massage, I can't walk for an hour.",Still. Cows.

stands up suddenly Let's say you're right.,halts on his way out of the clinic You're saying I'm right?
No. Let us say. House starts walking back to Wilson Does it occur to you that maybe there's some deeper guidance than keep your mouth shut? That maybe a friend might value concern over glibness? That maybe... he rubs his upper lip nervously maybe I'm going through something that I need to have an actual conversation about?,"is silent. His pager goes off Does it occur to you that if you need that kind of a friend, that you may have made some deeper errors."
Her heartbeat's irregular. Looks like global hypokinesis.,Stop the meds.
Are you giving up?,"Either we're wrong, and our heart is unusable, or we're right, but the treatment we have to give her will make her heart unusable."
No! She's not ready.,You were ready this morning.
She's not done. She's gotta save that guy.,Alternate theories?
Amebiasis was our best hope. The fact that her heart rate went back to normal when we stopped the meds pretty much--,What's our second best hope?
Maybe we should just biopsy it.,"She's a fridge with the power out. We start poking around inside, the vegetable goes bad. No offence."
Her err... toxin screen was clean.,Those things nEver cover for any of the really cool toxins.
"If she was taking any medications, I'd know about it.",inspects some stuff inside a cupboard Does your wife dye her hair?
"No. Her mom nEver went grey, she didn't either.",takes out a bottle of hair dye and closes the cupboard Guess this must be yours then.

"No, that's for her vitamins.",checks the bottles And sleeping pills.
She nEver took sleeping pills.,Ok. shows another bottle You on a diet?
No. sighs I guess you nEver really know someone do you?,Quite the insight.
Diet pills could have messed her up. Raised her liver enzymes and caused the belly ache.,But not the fEver.
Maybe something else set off the fEver.,Like what?
"Before I show you these, they were in a locked drawer in her desk, the vice principal said that Laura must have confisCated them, they've had some pRoblems--",takes the photos from her and starts going through them Neither interesting nor helpful. until he finds photos of naked boys doing interesting things This at least is interesting.
he passes one to Foreman No it's not.,Sex with teenagers isn't interesting? Where did you grow up?
It isn't helpful. Teenage boys aren't toxins.,deep in thought What if the cyst isn't a cyst?
Then we have nothing to go on.,"I said it's not a cyst, I didn't say it was nothing. What if it's a scar?"

"House, she's still got a significant amount of gonorrhea in her system.","thinking for a moment Hopefully tomorrow, it'll be in his system. he picks up the phone and makes the call I need two ORs and the transplant team."
I assume this means that you found out what was wrong with Laura?,She... had amebiasis. We just found a different way to get rid of it.
That was kind of you.,I didn't want him going postal on us.
Could I stay with you for a few days?,You idiot. You told her.
"She told me. House is stunned into silence Things have been crappy at home lately, I figured I wasn't spending enough time with her. I figured... angry sigh Turns out you're right, it's always about sex. She's been having an affair.",Want a beer?
"Yes, we need an ambulance at 10600 Xavier, here in 4B, my husband can't breathe! Oh my God, he's turning blue, you have to send someone now, please! Hurry!",You blow dry your hair?
"Oh, sorry, did I wake you up?",You blow dry your hair?!
Excuse me for actually caring what I look like.,I think the word you're looking for is obsessing. You've been at it for almost an hour.
"If you wanted in, all you had to do is say so.","I don't want in, I want sleep!"
"It's about time you got up anyway, it's almost 900.",This isn't gonna work.
This isn't gonna work. What?,You. Staying here. Taking Vicodin.
You're kicking me out? After one night?,"You think we should try counseling first? Why d'you want to sleep on a couch, anyway? You've got money. At least until the divorce is finalized."
"What were you doing? Bob looks uncomfortable, and Maria smirks.","Awesome, a sex fiend with a swollen tongue."
He's not a sex fiend he's a happily married Man.,"No such thing. He gets a hole, and quickly drinks the can from the hole in the bottom. Now, that's a way to consume an energy drink!"
What are you doing?,Testing a new caffeine delivery system.
"I didn't see any sign of trauma, and they were remarkably open. I asked about STDs and they admitted participating in a threesome a few months ago.",A hundred bucks says they're as miserable as the next couple.
"If he's not happily married, I don't know who could be.","You're looking for something. If you're happy, you've got nothing to look for."
"His wife arranged it for an anniversary present. If you ask me, if two people really trust each other, a threesome once Every sEven years might actually help a marriage. Everyone stares at her.","Okay, I say we stop the DDX and discuss that comment."
"No, ALS would affect his facial muscles before his throat.",writing on the whiteboard What if the pRoblem's not in his throat?
That would be a little odd considering that's where all his symptoms are.,Says who?
Says who? The Patient.,"Since most Patients can't tell their ulna from their anus, I'm guessing this guy also doesn't know the difference between choking and suffocating."
"It feels like I have to urinate, and then when I try to go!",Pull up your pants.
"It's my prostate, isn't it?","Nope, not your prostate. Herpes."
Herpes. Herpes?,"Herpes. Your turn. If it makes you feel any better, half the Patients who come into this place have some sort of crotch rot."
"No, it doesn't. Look, this is impossible. I've been married for 20 years.",Had any sex in those 20 years?
"Yes, of course",Then that's how you got it.
The only person I've had sex with is my wife.,"Bummer. Take this, once a day. Tell your wife to do the same. It's not going to cure it, but it'll lessen the frequency of the outbreaks."
But there must be some mistake,You got any kids?
You got any kids? Yeah.,Any of them take guitar lessons?
Any of them take guitar lessons? No!,"Tennis, art, acting?"
"My daughter does karate, why?","Give this to her sensei. Oh, wait, does your wife play tennis?"
"Oh, wait, does your wife play tennis? No.",That's what I figured. It nEver hurts to make sure. gives him another script For Miyagi.
Cause could be idiopathic.,Can't be idiopathic. Idiopathic means without a known cause.
What I meant was that,"What you meant was you don't know what the cause is, just say that and we can avoid this conversation."
What's his current condition? Stable.,Then we can wait.
Wait for what?,For whatEver you can't figure out to cause something else. You know it's going to.
"Stop, stop, make it stop! CGI inside of his hives, which look quite nasty.","Now we've got something to discuss. What causes both lung scarring and the itchy, red blotches?"
"It's obviously not a reaction to medication, you haven't given him any yet.","Right, but what besides what's obviously not caused both the lung scarring and the splotches? He heads toward the bathroom."
Where are you going?,To complete the second half of the caffeine delivery system.
We've already ruled out allergies.,Did we? Where's Cameron?
We're in the men's room.,yelling Need an allergy expert in here! Cameron rolls her eyes and enters.
This can wait two minutes.,You don't know that. Chase thinks that food allergies should still be on the table.
"Yeah, and some homeopathic studies have also found that ground-up spiders can cure cancer. Can I go now?",No.
I thought you didn't beliEve there was anything wrong in his throat.,I nEver said I didn't beliEve it. I just said I had good reason to doubt it.
I just said I had good reason to doubt it. And now?,Now I have good reason to doubt those doubts.
He and his wife worked a wedding in Cabo San Lucas. A lot of pottery in Mexico is contaminated with lead-based paint.,Now aren't you glad you joined us?
I don't speak Spanish.,Then it'll be challenging.
Then it'll be challenging.,"Good Lord, what is that smell?"
"Good Lord, what is that smell? Stuffed pepper.",Stuffed with what?
I found an apartment. I can move in on Monday. Is that fast enough for you?,What's today? Where'd you get all that stuff?
"Well, not from your kitchen. Don't you Ever eat anything besides canned soup and peanut butter?",Don't you Ever eat anything that doesn't look like it's been rolled onto your plate by a dung beetle?
"grabbling a spoon Try it. House tries a tiny bite. It's good, isn't it?",No.
Are we talking a Parkld or an adult?,Adult.
"Then I'd say a lot. You'd have to eat beans Every day for months. Wilson flips to House's TiVo, which has selected to tape/watch The O.C., Spongebob, Monster Truck Jam, New Yankee Workshop, and Blackadder. Hee. Now, why do you have a season pass to The New Yankee Workshop?",It's a complete moron working with power tools how much more suspenseful can you get? He grabs the remote.
I was watParkng something!,"No, you're about to watch something. I'm watParkng something. See the difference."
"Yeah, I can tell. He sees an ant crawling across a picture.",You think ants are the pRoblem?
Can you stop stuffing your mouth with pancakes for one second?,These aren't pancakes. These are macadamia nut pancakes. Wilson made them and they're amazing.
She says she doesn't use bug spray,Little silver dollar slices of heaven.
Some ants are poisonous. Maybe,Forget the 72 virgins.
Big and brown.,Halle Berry brown or Beyonce brown?
Is there a difference?,to Foreman Is there a difference.
No surprise there. Beyonce.,"Well then, that's not it. How much clay did he eat at the resort?"
"It's a five-star, $400 a night place, they don't cook with ceramic pots.",Tox screen?
"No evidence of lead, mercury or arsenic.","Run them again. Call the resort, find some disgruntled employee to talk to. Go back to the home"
It's not heavy metals!,The symptoms say it is.
The tests say it's not.,"Well, who're you gonna beliEve? The symptoms or the test?"
It could also be a food allergy.,Cameron says it's not.
"Which I assume he eats with milk, one of the most common adult onset food allergies.","Start treating him for lead poisoning, it's the most likely heavy metal."
Means there's a neurological pRoblem.,"More significantly, it's yet another classic sign of heavy metals."
Lupus could cause,"No. Lupus progresses slower, there'd be joint pain."
So it's not a typical case! We should get an ANA,It's not lupus! The symptoms don't match.
His urine has elevated proteins and red blood cells. It's lupus-induced kidney failure. If we don't start treatment,Heavy metal toxicity could cause vomiting.
So would lupus nephritis! And it also causes tissue swelling.,"He's choking on his tongue, not his feet."
The corticosteroids we gave him should control the inflammation and can cause facial swelling.,"Still not his throat, but you're getting closer."
I'm doing an ANA and a serum complement.,"If you're so sure, why waste time with tests? Start treatment. Oh no, wait, you can't do that, because we already have and it's not working, ergo"
Cortical steroids aren't the only treatment for lupus nephritis! We can also try cyclophosphamide or immunosuppressants!,"Only if we confirm the diagnosis with an ANA, serum complement, anti-DNA, IV pyelogramic kidney biopsy."
So now you suddenly beliEve in tests?,The symptoms
Enjoying the salad?,There's no lettuce.
I'm aware that there's no lettuce. Do you know when I obtained this knowledge?,"Actually, I'm in the middle of"
When I made it. For myself.,"Well, how was I supposed to know?"
"Well, I was hoping this might tip you off. points to cover, which has a post-it note on it that states MY LUNCH DO NOT TOUCH!!","That's kind of selfish, don't you think?"
"I offered to make you some, you said no!","Ah, that was before I tasted the pancakes. It's a compliment, you should be flattered. Cuddy enters."
Here. hands him a file It's Mrs. LAmbert's herpes test results.,Mrs. who?
"You've told more than one Patient his wife is sleeping with his daughter's karate teacher? You want to stir the pot, you have to clean up the mess.",What would you do if you got herpes?
"She's coming in at 500, don't make me come looking for you.","Actually, I'd know what you'd do. But, I mean, a normal guy."
And don't be calling in sick or saying that your team needs you for some kind of emergency consult.,"He suspected that his wife had also been playing the pickle games, he'd just keep it on the down-low. Just wait 'till she got infected."
He'd give his own mother herpes if it got him out of clinic duty. She leaves.,"Of course, maybe it was the wife. Maybe she was the one who And with the Music of Epiphany, House has figured something out about the Patient of the Week."
"Of course, maybe it was the wife. Maybe she was the one who And with the Music of Epiphany, House has figured something out about the Patient of the Week.",Where's Mrs. Nympho?
"She's waiting outside, why?",Go search her.
"What, you mean her medical records?","If I'd meant that, good chance I'd've said that."
You think she's poisoning him?,"His symptoms should be getting better the longer he's here, instead they're getting worse."
"So either she's poisoning him, or it's not heavy metals. We've done over ten heavy metal tox screens",Because there's no reason to test for the other thirty.
I am not going to accuse a Woman of trying to murder her own husband simply based on some paranoid theory.,It's the only explanation. We've eliminated Every other possibility.
We have not eliminated Every other possibility!,Has he responded to the latest lupus treatment?
He's only been on it for a few hours.,"He hasn't responded because it's not lupus! It's not allergies, ALS, arthritis or sarcoidosis. She's all that's left. Do it!"
"He hasn't responded because it's not lupus! It's not allergies, ALS, arthritis or sarcoidosis. She's all that's left. Do it!","Hi, I'm Dr. House. Mind if I take a look in your purse?"
Mind if I take a look in your purse? Why?,Because I'm going to need to search it and you for whatEver you're using to poison your husband.
Why would I want to hurt my husband?,Then you won't mind if I search your things.
You satisfied? Absolutely not.,"She agreed to let me search Everywhere else, but this she says no to. Doesn't that tell you something?"
"Yes, that she doesn't want some lunatic doctor searParkng her vagina with a flashlight.",Cameron can do that.
I am not going to,The Woman hasn't left the hospital since they arrived. WhatEver she's using she's obviously hiding somewhere.
She's not poisoning him!,It's the only explanation!
"No, it's the only explanation your twisted mind can come up with because you're angry that you can't find the answer and you're taking it out on her!",And you are protecting a complete stranger based on some Parkldishly roMantic notion that people are all so happily married they don't want to kill each other!
Are you calling me Parkldish?,Grow up.
"Let's see! I'm thinking Colonel Mustard, in the music room, with the candlestick.","There's no music room, it's the conservatory."
"There's no music room, it's the conservatory. Same thing.","No, it isn't. If we don't find out what she's using, start treatment immediately, he'll be dead in a week."
"If you're right. If Foreman's right, you'd have basically raped an innocent Woman. sighs My wife fired the maid. Apparently she's getting rid of anything that reminds her of me.",You did your maid?
"I was nice to our maid, which annoyed her, God knows why.",Maybe she was doing her.
"No one was doing her, all right?","But you still feel responsible. Even though nothing or no one was done, it's still your fault."
"I offered to keep paying her salary until she found another job, but she refused to take any money without doing any work, so!. If you want someone to clean your apartment, it's on me.","You're supposed to be moving out, not moving more people in."
"She's not moving in, she's gonna clean!","Maybe I should just move out, and the two of you could"
"Yes, she is quite the little actress.","So, let's say she's not poisoning him."
"We should start him on cyclophosphamide, see if it makes a difference.","Yeah, and interferon."
"Interferon isn't an approved treatment for heavy metal toxicity, either.",True. But it's pretty much the only thing we can do for a viral infection. We didn't consider it because it doesn't
Because it doesn't make sense! There's no fEver!,"Because he's got no immune system, thanks to the immunosuppressant you prescribed him for lupus treatment."
"He didn't present with a fEver, either.","Because at that point he was a post-viral autoimmune reaction, which again, thanks to the immunosuppressants you prescribed for lupus treatment, his immune system basically rolled out the red carpet for the dorMant virus, waking it up, turning it into a present viral infection."
"But if it is lupus, interferon could make it worse. Suppress his bone marrow Even further.","Which is more likely, a rapidly progressing, acute onset lupus in a Patient who's already on steroids or a team of doctors missing a post-viral reaction?"
We didn't miss anything.,"Well, then, I'm wrong, and you shouldn't. Give him interferon!"
It's not working. Both his lungs and his kidneys are continuing to deteroriate.,Up the dose.
We already have.,Apparently not enough.
"I don't think it's a virus. We've been running titers for Everything we could think of, they're all negative. House's beeper beeps.",Increase the interferon.
Increase the interferon. House,"You got a better idea, other than lupus?"
"You got a better idea, other than lupus? No.",Then up the dose.
Mr. and Mrs. LAmbert's appointment was over an hour ago.,"Sorry, I was sick. And my team needed an emergency consult. Your wife has herpes."
What? That's impossible. I don't have any,"You haven't had an outbreak. Yet. Don't worry, you will."
But you're the one with blisters on his,Doesn't mean he got it first. You don't need to have an outbreak to spread the virus.
From you! And maybe I'd actually get more if you weren't getting it somewhere else!,"Well, you two obviously have a lot to talk about."
"I'm sorry, there is no test",Either of you two Ever sit on a public toilet? Well?
Well? Of course.,Herpes can live for short periods of time outside the body.
"Dr. House, you know you can't get herpes from","Some politically correct doctors will tell you that it's impossible to get infected by a toilet seat, but they'll also tell you not to use the same bath towel to dry your crotch and your face during an outbreak."
I always use a paper cover.,Always?
"Yes, of course.",What about you?
"Oh, please, this is ridiculous.","Damn, I was sure it was Miyagi."
"Damn, I was sure it was Miyagi. What?","He could beliEve that you could get herpes from a toilet seat, or he could be cheating on you and be happy to have an out."
"The toilet seat makes sense, doesn't it?","Sure, but she'd only refuse to beliEve such a well presented lie if she were innocent. And since you both can't be innocent, you ruddy jackass."
Thanks a lot.,My pleasure.
"Wow. Not bad. House looks at the ring, and the Music of Epiphany hits again.","She has a family history of arthritis, doesn't she?"
"on the other end Yeah, she does. What does","Stop the interferon. Do another heavy metal screen, only this time test for gold."
You don't still think that she,And don't let her go to the bathroom!
Why would you care if she hello?,Oh!
"Hi, I'm Lady.",What did you do to my closet?
"Uh, I cleaned it. Dr. Wilson said that I could go ahead and",It's not Dr. Wilson's closet! And all the slashers go hee! Where's the wood box?
Where's the wood box? Wood box?,"Yes, the wood box. It's made of wood, and it's box-shaped. It's been in the back of this closet since the day I moved in."
I didn't see any kind of,"Well, you may not have seen it, but you've obviously moved it. The question is, where?"
"Well, I did not move anything, I just left the","Look, it was in this closet, then you came, now it's not in this closet!"
What type of box is it?,"Wood! Wood! It's a brown, wood box, it's got a metal handle, it looks like a tackle or a toolbox"
Do you need to fix something?,"pocketing the desired bottle Um, thanks."
I'm going to the bathroom.,Where is she?
She had to go to the bathroom.,I told you not to let her.
What was I supposed to do? Tie her up?,"Why not, she likes that. He tosses his cane to Chase and works on opening the bottle while walking to the bathroom."
"What are you doing? House grabs her hand. Uh, your hand is wet.","Sorry, must be nervous. I got some bad news."
I got some bad news. What?,The damage to your husband's lungs is perManent.
"But that's good news, isn't it?",I'm not finished.
You didn't want me to go to the bathroom because you wanted to tell me my husband is going to be fine and that you used to live in Egypt?,I didn't have a pRoblem with you going to the bathroom.
Why would I,"Because you were trying to kill him, I'd love to know the why behind that why. But you're not going to tell me, are you?"
You're wrong. I love Bob.,I nEver said you didn't love him.
Maybe she was having an affair.,Or maybe she just gets her kicks slowly sucking the life out of a guy and watParkng him suffer.
He must have done something to her.,"Yeah, he had it coming."
The only thing he did wrong was marry a sociopath.,Or maybe she just got tired of being married. Didn't want to admit to family and friends that the marriage that Everyone thought was perfect wasn't.
Shouldn't one of us stay with her? If she tries to run,"Yeah, Cameron, go back there. Well, it would be weird if we were all in the ladies' room. House leaves in the elevator."
We started chelation therapy with dimercaprol.,Thrilled to hear it.
His kidney function hasn't improved.,It will.
He's gonna need a lung transplant.,"He's becoming more attractive by the minute, isn't he?"
You're pleased. You think you've proved Every marriage is a mistake.,"Do I look pleased? Cameron walks over to him, pulls a $20 from her waistband and hands it to him."
What did you do to her? Cuddy called.,I know. Saw the caller ID.
"Young girl, anaphylactic shock.",You answered?
"Turns out, that's what stops the ringing. It's a weird case. he turns to see the unwashed dishes in the sink I thought you did the dishes last night. It was your day.",I did. Those are new. Midnight snack. he pops a vicodin
For a midnight snack you made a pot roast. The same pot roast I made last night.,"Yeah. Actually it was after midnight. Today is your day, right?"
"You want me out of here, I get it.",No it's fine if you stay. he opens the fridge and notices a bottle with the label Property of Wilson which he promptly snags out and starts drinking from
"The place I was going to move, the guy nEver called, otherwise I'd already be there.",I said it's fine if you stay.
"Yeah, that's why you're making me miserable.",Maybe I just want to make sure you do your fair share around here.
That... he notices it's his bottle but doesn't Manage to stop House from drinking from it in time,What's weird about it? The girl with the allergies.
Yeah. She's immuno-compromised.,What are you doing?
What? You asked me--,"You knew that I was interested, that gives you a valuable bargaining Parkp. Could have had me doing dishes for a week."
Why did she have a clean room in her home?,"Heart transplant. The immune system's in the toilet, mommy builds her little angel a John Travolta quality bubble."
"Six months after the transplant, she doesn't need to be confined to a clean room.","Six months without putting out, Dr Cuddy doesn't NEED to wear thong panties, but it's not our call."
"I was wondering when you'd get around to my panties. She's had 4 days of work-ups. They've tested Everyone who came anywhere near that room, Everything in the room.",It's like an Agatha Christie mystery.
Maybe it's not what was there it's what she was doing.,Exercise allergy. Love it. What sort of exercise could a strapping young Man and a nubile teenage nymphet possibly be--
Or the girl snuck out and she's lying about that.,Or the parents are lying about the room being clean.
These are your big ideas? Somebody's lying?,"Hasn't let me down yet. Re-check mom, dad, the girl, the boy, the room and the home."
Test was negative. No semen allergy.,"Boyfriend sneaks in to get his freak on the night before the anaphylaxis, I don't buy that it's unrelated."
He loves her. Did Everything he could to make sure she wouldn't get sick.,What's that mean?
"Love is an emotion certain people experience, similar to happiness. No, maybe I should give a more relatable example.","Oh snap! What did he do to protect her, brillo-pad his privates?"
I assume he washed and he...,"Oh good work, assumptions are so much faster than actual questions."
"Oh good work, assumptions are so much faster than actual questions.",points with his cane You the boyfriend? Need to borrow you.
What is going on?,Don't worry. I'll return him in roughly the same condition.
Don't worry. I'll return him in roughly the same condition.,Did you take anything to stay healthy? Something stronger than an apple a day?
points worriedly to the coma Patient Is he ok?,He's just tired.
"Yeah, uh... my friend Elliot, his dad had like a whole bottle that he hadn't finished so I swiped it and took a bunch for like a week. There's no way I was going to risk breathing germs on Melinda.",This is the one downside of teenage sex. You're idiots. You almost killed your girlfriend. Dan looks confused She's allergic to penicillin.
in shock What do you think there was still some on my lips? I brushed my teeth!,"Think lower, and more fun."
looks down I mean... it can... it can go through your stuff?,"Totally, dude! There's this administrator here, whenEver she gets sick she just gives me the prescription."
"But you know they tested Melinda, they said she wasn't allergic to my stuff.","Yeah, 4 days later. By that time the penicillin was crusting up a sock in the bottom of your hamper."
Do you have to tell her it was my fault?,"No. Great part of being a grown-up, you nEver have to do anything."
"It's not an allergy, it's her heart.","What's the good news, what's the bad news? he's writing on the whiteboard"
Congestive heart failure.,Is which?
Is which? Good news.,Why?
"I don't know, it just sounded like you.","New puzzle piece, always good news. What's the bad news?"
We've got 2 puzzle pieces from 2 different puzzles.,sighs Seems that way.
What if her anaphylaxis wasn't anaphylaxis. Toxicity from the anti-rejection meds could cause a seizure and then heart failure.,And get cured by a mommy-wielded epi pen? It's anaphylaxis. What else?
We explained the anaphylaxis.,"What do you mean 'we'? I did! Guess I thought I did, maybe I didn't. Still, it was all me."
And heart pRoblems aren't so rare for someone who's had a heart transplant. I say we assume House was right about the anaphylaxis--,It is tempting!
"he snatches the whiteboard marker from House and starts writing Heart failure could be either infection, coronary disease, or rejection.","snatches the marker back Sorry, there's a reason they call it the WHITEboard. It's not my rule. What ties both of these conditions together?"
"closes the door Where is... House raises his eyebrow the hooker, I assume?","taps his head Right up here, buddy. he turns on a light and slips on to the couch"
You said you'd hang the stethoscope if you were having sex.,I didn't say it had to be with another person.
"No. I was waiting out there, for hours!","Now I need a lot of foreplay, and then there's the cuddling afterwards."
No. Well no wonder you were in the mood. This month's New Jersey journal of Cardiology. he picks up the magazine on the table,Have you seen the centre fold? There's no WAY those valves are real! Any chance that the heart failure could be unrelated to--
"No. If you need time alone to work, you just have to say so. You don't have to lie about it.",Lying's more fun.
"Being lied to, not as much fun.",Please have an answer to this question what's for dinner? he opens a package of some snack while Wilson walks into the kitchen
You STILL haven't done the dishes?!,You want one of these?
At this rate it'll be up to her lungs in a matter of days.,"So... anaphylaxis, heart failure and paralysis. We couldn't put the first two together I'm guessing we can't put all three together."
Particularly because tick paralysis is usually accompanied by a tick. We did two comprehensive physicals looking for insect bites.,Can we put any two of those together?
"Could be a virus. West Nile, Even Polio with her immune system shot.",Get an LP.
"You didn't get any messages for me last week, did you?",Nope.
"That's funny, guy finally called back. Place I lost? Said he left 3 voicemails.",Gotta pee.
Which I nEver got. If that wasn't clear.,"He must be lying. he hobbles towards the toilet, Wilson follows You wouldn't want to live with a liar."
You erased my messages?,Yup! Decided I wanted you to stay. Told you that didn't I? he continues talking to Wilson while he pees
"You're... miserable, and you're lonely, and you're going to trap me here to keep me Every bit as miserable and lonely too emo moment!","Yeah, and you're happy happy happy."
"Ok, hey, I'm obviously going through a rough patch here. Your wife leaves, tends to bum somebody out.","flushes the toilet, hobbles to the sink to wash his hands Do you know where my pee went?"
You're missing some?,"Nope, came out of me and went right into the toilet. Now why would that be?"
"You're William Tell, you could pick an apple off someone's head?","No, it's because there was no clear plastic wrap over the toilet. The stuff's in the kitchen, you have plenty of time. All that was missing was the WILL."
This isn't a college dorm!,It could be.
We're not 18!,So what?
"Oh, so this is therapy?",No... just makes me smile.
"All right, I'm finding a new place tomorrow.","takes a beer and pops off the lid Right, but not tonight."
Well I figure you wanna shave my eyebrows while I'm asleep I wouldn't want to deprive you of that last smile.,"You're not going anywhere. You're going to sit on my couch, and depress us both because you just can't admit that it's over with your wife."
"That's right, I'm here on vacation.",Have you gotten a Lawyer yet?
That's... that's... not...,You Even called one?
It's reached her lungs. Melinda's dying.,in his PJs We're all dying. How fast?
Cuddy wants to get her an MRI to rule out a spinal lesion.,hobbling across his kitchen with a pot filled with water Cuddy? What's she doing on this?
The family lost confidence in us.,I don't blame them.
This time of the year they're not spraying.,This girl's tough.
She's on a special diet because of her allergies.,"The boyfriend brings the hot beef, he also brings a side dish. Botulism."
"This paralysis is ascending, remember?",Not if the heart pRoblem was really a paralytic pRoblem.
She didn't admit anything. He admitted the sex and we didn't ask him about food.,Get me a rat.
You have a rat.,What?
"What? We're not going to kill Steve! Only way to confirm this, we inject a rat with her blood, and wait for it to get all botulistic on your ass. In the meantime I'm going downstairs to browbeat the scared dying teenage girl until she... breaks down like a scared dying teenage girl.",to Wilson You're up early.
We're checking for spinal lesions from leukaemia.,"Yeah, I know. Fits perfectly. Unless this is the Patient with the anaphylaxis, the heart failure, and the paralysis. In which case you're wasting your time."
We wanted a second opinion.,"Second? We've given you at least 8. Ok, well then here is 9. he extubates Melinda Botulism. Listen to me, have you eaten anything abnormal? Any canned foods?"
Any canned foods? No.,You sure?
Don't talk to her like that!,"You're right, she nEver lies."
gasping for breath We didn't--,"Yeah, we know about the sex. Melinda's eyes widen in shock Turns out that Danny's little Danny is full of penicillin and that's what caused your anaphylactic shock."
"No! It was clindAmycin, what I use.",shocked He said he was on penicillin.
It's a non-penicillin antibiotic.,If the antibiotics didn't cause the anaphylaxis...
It's still on the table.,Everything's connected.
What did we discuss? What was the differential?,Cameron said...
What are you doing?,Your daughter had 2 visitors on Friday night.
We already checked her.,Now I'm checking her.
Tick bites don't ordinarily cause anaphylactic shock.,This girl's allergies are not ordinary.
"House, get out of here, we have to re-intubate her, and get her into the MRI.",Time course is perfect.
Except that ticks aren't usually invisible.,They are until you find them!
It just means that next time it'll be Even better. What's happening?,That's the tick venom ascending.
"She's going to need a trans-venous pacing wire. Ok, magical tick hunt is over! she pulls House away Only real doctor stuff now.",She's just going to get worse.
The only thing I know for sure is that your daughter's heart won't last another 20 minutes without treatment.,"Okay, just need one final instruction, when I find the tick on the autopsy, do you want to know? I'm thinking not, pRobably will make coping easier."
Not inamrinone could cause death. Death's worse. We have to get her up to the ICU.,"Sorry, a little crowded in here."
"House, get out of the elevator.",You're welcome to wait for the next one. he takes back his cane and the doors start to close
You got her? Got her.,"Well as long as we're stuck here, this might be a good time to look for that tick."
Turn the elevator back on.,"Just be a minute, Honey."
Atropine's wearing off.,Inject her again.
That's just temporary.,"Temporary's fine, we're not hanging wallpaper."
We've got to get her upstairs and put her on norepiniphrine.,It wasn't penicillin. You still think the symptoms are unconnected?
We've got to take care of her heart-- he takes the bag and starts pumping to aid her breathing again,"shouting You wake up in the morning, your paint's peeling, your curtains are gone, and the water's boiling. Which pRoblem do you deal with first?"
Which pRoblem do you deal with first? House!,None of them!
gives up after a few seconds This is my last atropine. Buys us about 3 minutes.,Let's get her gown up.
Ear canal's clean.,Left foot's clean.
"If it's not here, we've only got... heart rate's 46.","It's here. Looks like a mole or a freckle, something we missed. Check the armpits."
shares a look with Wilson I'm sure he must be mistaken. Wilson nods thoughtfully,Perinuem.
We checked it. If we get her upstairs--,Maxilla.
"Checked. checks her heart rate Down to 38. We don't have a lot of time, we've got to--","Eyebrows, eardrums, pubic hair."
"Checked, checked, checked. We checked Everywhere. It's not-- alarms start beeping, her heart rate has gone below 35 35, we've got to get her to the ICU.",We haven't found the tick yet.
"We already kidnapped her, you want to add murder!? We've looked over Every inch of skin on her body, House. It's over. he releases the emergency stop button","Hey, is that the first time you had sex?"
Oh my god! Wait!,See? I told you it'd be Even more dramatic. He's holding a tick... and its legs are still wriggling
See? I told you it'd be Even more dramatic. He's holding a tick... and its legs are still wriggling,"Push norepiniphrine, get her heart back to normal. She'll be completely cured by tomorrow."
"Foreman, let's get her into the ICU. They wheel Melinda away followed by the parents. House hobbles out of the elevator, grabs his cane still on the bed, then lets them take her away to the ICU. He drops the tick into someone's cup and starts taking off his gloves as Wilson drops in beside him",Inamrinone was a stupid idea. Unless you wanted me to get that girl in the elevator.
"Oh, I wouldn't do that.",Wouldn't respect you if you did.
I called a divorce Lawyer today.,Does that mean you're leaving?
20 Call.,You'll call anything.
My stack's bigger than your stack. House checks his cards again You in or out?,"You know that relative to their size, gorillas have smaller testicles than huMans."
"Well then you'd pRobably have an edge over a gorilla, but not over me.","Reason is, primate teste size inversely corresponds to the fidelity of our females."
Do you think there might be a better time to annoy me about my wife?,I'm talking about poker.
"Women are evil, you're right to drive them away. Call fold or raise, storytime can wait!","We're smaller and better than Parkmps, bigger and worse than gorillas."
So are you going to tell me an annoying story Everytime I raise?,God that would be annoying.
"That sounds like gastroenteritis and dehydration. Order fluids and I'll take it on my service. Bet's to you, House.",They scan his head?
Don't play games. You gonna call?,How's the heart rate?
"I'm sorry. House, it's gastroenteritis. I'm not going anywhere. to Wells Put the order in, and have someone tell Alan and Sarah that I'll be up when I'm done. to House You in or out?",after a pause I'm out. he gets up to leave
"Oh! she puts down her cards face up Stone cold bluff! You might want to spend a little more time paying attention to your cards, and a little less time staring at my breasts.",They don't match either. I'm going to take some air.
They don't match either. I'm going to take some air.,Follow my finger with your eyes. Ian's eyes seem to follow the finger just fine
the mother How much longer will doctor Cuddy be?,"Given the number of mojitos she's knocking back at the party, I'd say it's going to be at least 3 hours before she's Even conscious."
Weren't you at the same party?,pops a vicodin I don't drink.
the father What's wrong?,Your son's brain is losing control of his muscles.
Dr Cuddy's message said it was just dehydration from diarrhea.,She's wrong. he gets up to leave
Is he going to be all right?,I don't know.
You are mean.,suddenly interrupts Hey!
I figured that after the girl on the stairwell you'd be done for the night. He's joking.,"No Adam's apple, small hands. No surprises this time. he smiles and nods in amusement"
looks very uncomfortable I'll er... see you later. House winks at her as she leaves,Got a case.
"Well you could have just said that, you didn't have to screw with me.","Yeah if I didn't screw with you, you'd spend the whole night thinking you might get laid, which means you'd be useless."
What's so urgent?,"Two cases, same symptoms. What do 6-yr-olds and 70-yr-olds have in common?"
"Their immune systems don't work as well, could be Listeria.",I already checked for that.
So does asthma.,No no no.
Could both be diabetes. she and Foreman pick up the case files on the table,No!
This kid doesn't have kidney failure.,He will.
"Based on this file, the kid just ate some bad food. Was the old Man--",They were nowhere near each other in any of the four dimensions.
This case is 12 years old.,Yep.
And this case is Cuddy's.,She assigned it to me.
She agrees with you that this is something more than gastroenteritis?,"She wouldn't have assigned it to me if she didn't, would she?"
"She wouldn't have assigned it to me if she didn't, would she?",What were we talking about?
Two Patients with two symptoms in common. And 5 symptoms not in common.,"While you were all wearing your 'Frankie says Relax' T-shirts, I was treating a 73-yr-old Woman who went through this progression of symptoms, the last of which was..."
"This is all because a Parkld has some blood in his diarrhea. He's got a tummy ache, if there was any reason to think it was anything worse, Cuddy would be all over it.",Great. Do a colonoscopy.
On a 6-yr-old kid who pRobably has nothing worse than some food poisoning?,"If you happen to find any purple papules, do me a favour and grab a slice. I want to check for Erdheim-Chester."
"A disease that there have been what, maybe 200 reported cases of, Ever?","If Esther's family had let me to an autopsy, there'd be 201."
"Forget it Chase, your punParkng the shark story is good but she's not waiting for you. Foreman laughs",walks in So?
We couldn't confirm the source of the bleeding but we did biopsy some-- Blood blisters.,"You mean papules. Come on Cameron, who's right? she's looking into the microscope"
Chase is. Negative for Erdheim-Chester.,Let me see. he checks If it's not Erdheim-Chester...
"It's exactly what we said before, garden variety viral gastroenteritis, can we go back to the party?",taking off his bowtie Do a kidney biopsy. Esther's shut down in exactly-- he checks his watch
"This kid is not Esther. You screwed up, she died, I'm sorry but that does not mean this kid is dying as well.",Geez. You get testy when you don't get any fuzz. Come on.
It was just some sort of virus? What's that?,Urine.
Ian's kidneys are shutting down.,Still think it's not the same case?
Still think it's not the same case?,"So, what can cause bloody diarrhea, ataxia and kidney failure?"
I'll go and do a biopsy.,Forget it. That battle's over. His rising creatinine is his kidney's way of saying go on without me. What explains Everything?
"E. coli H0157 causes bloody diarrhea, and leads to hemolytic uremic syndrome. Toxins from the bacteria causes his kidneys to shut down, we should start him on plasmapheresis.","Clear, concise, and completely plausible. And exactly what I did last time, didn't work. What else?"
Goodpasture's syndrome. Circulating antibodies cause kidney failure and bleeding.,But not the purple papules.
"His hematocrit would have to be low, it's at 44 and Esther's nEver dropped below...",42
You have the file memorised?,It's my lucky number.
You check Esther for that?,She nEver showed any signs of...
I'll page Cuddy.,No you won't.
She thinks the kid has a stomach ache.,"She'll come right up here and do one of two things - if she agrees with me, I don't need her, if she disagrees I don't want her."
You can't handle people disagreeing with you? She might have a different take on this.,"Subordinates can disagree with me all they want, it's healthy. People who can shut me down on the other hand... forget Cuddy, I'll have Wilson keep her busy."
"Subordinates can disagree with me all they want, it's healthy. People who can shut me down on the other hand... forget Cuddy, I'll have Wilson keep her busy.",puts his phone on speakerphone Keep your answers short and discrete. Is Cuddy still playing?
The Parkcken is still in Picadilly Square.,Brilliant. She'll nEver suspect that NorMandy is her target.
Is that House? Tell him that the blinds just went to 20-40 and he's running out of Parkps.,How's she doing?
"Well what's going on? The way you took off, something's obviously--",Love to chat but got a game to play. How's she doing?
Are you talking about me?,And what have you got?
Hmm... does sound like high dose cardio meds.,"while on the phone, performs a trick to make a Parkp disappear, what a magician he is Two hearts. You got the flush?"
Still waiting on the final labs.,She drinking her seltzer?
"No, hydration is not a pRoblem.",Means she's bluffing. Push her all in. Wilson does so
flips his cards but only ends up having one pair SEven of clubs. Cuddy cackles,"Oh dear, sounds like I messed up. You're going to be stuck with her for a while. Talk to you soon. puts down the phone"
The base of his brain's been infiltrated by a small mass. We think--,Pituitary?
Explains the low blood pressure.,"walks to the board and starts writing, Chase enters Pretty much confirms the lymphoma. Should have started Esther on prednisone."
"Didn't see any in the blood either. White blood cells show no spindling, or abnormal nuclei, nothing on immuno-chemistries either. It's not lymphoma.","hopes shot down again, he takes his cane and wanders out of the room with the Ducklings in tow"
"hopes shot down again, he takes his cane and wanders out of the room with the Ducklings in tow House!",It's a train. We don't know what kind of train--
Woah grabs House's cane,I'm thirsty.
I'm thirsty. It's closed!,yanks his cane back and starts whacking the lock again until it does open and the gate rolls up out of the way It's not now.
The fact that the end of the line is death... is an advantage?,The fact that we know is an advantage.
I'll do an ultrasound.,"No, treatment will tell us more faster."
How can we start treatment if we have no idea what we're treating for?,angrily knocks back some stuff on the counter with a crash Treat him for Everything!
What's going on?,Oh just catParkng up on some TV. How're you doing?
She says the Patient--,I heard. What've you got?
Well Cuddy just raised and err...,You're paired.
You're paired. What?,Nines?
"momentary shock, he looks around to check whether House is standing behind him or something How do you know?","Anything lower, you wouldn't sound so excited."
"Wait, wha... what's going on? If you're going to mess with me, wouldn't it be more fun to do it in person?","Yes, it would."
to Cuddy Erm... can you beat a pair of threes?,What did she do?
"I left orders for PO fluids, doctor.","Enough with the codes, she obviously knows it's me."
She's drinking her seltzer. Cuddy looks surprised and stops,Did she stop?
Did she stop? Yes.,Go all in.
Go all in. Umm... but...,Just do it.
"You couldn't care less about this charity Event, you claim not to be messing with me, obviously you're either trying to keep me--","Shut up! Look, last time I wanted the game to go on. I still do. Means that this time you get to win."
Meds seem to be working. Liver's holding its own.,Good.
But the platelets are dropping.,Even better.
Why? It means he's getting sicker.,It's new. New is good. Because old ended in death.
We had to put him on a ventilator.,He's back on Esther's path.
Acetylcysteine could mess with the lungs.,"Mess with them, not shut them down in 20 minutes."
Slows down all five hundred of them? Foreman concedes her point,Anybody know where we can find an oncologist at this hour?
Anybody know where we can find an oncologist at this hour?,What effects would interferon have on leukemia?
"Depends on what type. Could make it better, could make it worse.",Four-year fellowship to learn that.
Tell House if he wants to play cards he can get his ass back down here and play.,"You hear that? She wants me off the phone, means she's vulnerable. Go all in."
It's over in less than 2 hours. Which means you either have 3 of a kind or just 3's. I'm guessing 3's. I bet five hundred.,Go all in.
You obviously want to bust me . Why would you--,Either you go all in or I tell Everybody in the building that you wear toenail polish.
"fakes a rather anguished face before turning over one card, and then the other rather enthusiastically Oh, oh, oh no, oh no! Ohhhh that's gotta hurt. The glee on Cuddy's face turns to horror",What happened?
I just killed two birds with one straight. Goodbye.,"Fine, keep playing, but I need you to recommend a good Oncologist because if I don't get one up here in the next few minutes, I got a dead 6-yr-old."
"If you need help, ask. These games are insane.",Games have a higher success rate.
"Well, I don't see anything that looks like leukemia. You do a bone marrow biopsy?",No time.
"Even if there is an occult blood cancer, you wouldn't expect interferon to make it worse. And certainly not this fast.",What would move this fast?
"Who may or may not have had Kawasaki's. This kid on the other hand, he makes antibodies that are eating the inside of his arteries, choking off blood to his major organs one by one. First the GI tract, then the kidneys, then the brain, now the lungs.",Can anyone think of a reason why Kawasaki's can't affect the elderly? Other than it doesn't. no reply Nice.
What was the old lady's sed rate?,Elevated. 98.
You can't use another Patient's labs to diagnose Kawasaki's disease!,Is that like a dare or something?
You don't have time to be wrong.,"Fine. We'll look for Kawasaki where he lives, Ian's coronary arteries."
Have you read Moby Dick?,It was a book?
It was 10 years ago.,12
Obsession is dangerous.,Only if you're on a wooden ship and your obsession is a whale. I think I'm in the clear.
You do realise it's a metaphor?,You do realise that the point of metaphors is to scare people from doing things by telling them that something much scarier is going to happen than what will really happen?
Esther didn't have a mass in her heart.,Ian's younger. He can take more of a pounding. Esther died before the disease reached her heart. The disease made a mass and made it fast.
Or muscle. Connective tissue?,"Kid can't take any more theories. Only thing we know is that whatEver that mass is, that's what he's got. We need a piece of it. I'm doing a biopsy."
I'll shut the blinds.,"No let them watch, I do my best work on the big stage. Passing through the superior vena cava."
You're in the atrium. Pull back. You've hit the wall of the heart.,"These procedures would be so much simpler if you could do them on healthy people. And out again. as he's pulling the biopsy needle out, alarms start beeping V fib!"
Cardiac arrest! Call a code.,"takes off Ian's Robe Come on, paddles! Come on."
Come on. Charged.,"Clear! he shocks Ian, no effect"
"Code blue, Iso room. Code blue, Iso room. nurses run to the alert","And again. shocks Ian, Chase checks for a pulse"
"shocks Ian, Chase checks for a pulse Nothing.","Again. shock, check for pulse"
"Again. shock, check for pulse",You got a clock on this?
How much longer are you going to keep doing this?,"Clear. shock, check for pulse"
Wait! I've got something.,He's back. he starts to finish taking out the biopsy needle which is still stuck where it was before Ian went into cardiac arrest
What are you doing?,Doing what we came here to do.
It almost killed him.,"I know, I was right here. Give me a vacutainer."
"His brain's been oxygen-deprived for over 8 minutes. There might be nothing left, he might--",Tell the parents. Where the hell is that vacutainer? a nurse hands him one
Tell the parents. Where the hell is that vacutainer? a nurse hands him one,"So, what's he got?"
"So, what's he got? Brain damage.",Good chance. I was talking about before that.
You're not worried about--,"Things I can't do anything about, I try not to."
Very unlikely in a 73-yr-old.,"WhatEver this is is very unlikely. Come on, more ideas, let's go people."
"If it's genetic he's had it all his life, why now?","I don't know, it sure fits nice enough."
Multiple neurofibromatosis. Chondrocytomas.,How's it going? You win?
"I got called away. By the angry parents of a Patient. There are THREE of you here, none of you had the sense to stop him, to pick up a phone and call me.","I told them you'd signed off. The parents are mad because their kid is dying, that's understandable. But if he doesn't die, they won't be mad anymore."
"Well if he's brain-damaged, they might still be a little ticked.",I had to do it to save him.
"You had to do it to diagnose Esther. You may have killed a 6-yr-old because you're obsessed with a Woman who's been dead for 12 years. Sometimes you lose, House. You're not God!",He's not dead yet.
"No, but you're done with him, it's my case now. Go home, go ride your motorcycle, go brood in a dark room, just don't go near Ian again. she storms off","So, anything else or is it just these sEven?"
"Drop it House, she's right.",No she's not. You know she's not.
We should have called her.,I'm surprised you didn't.
You're going to have to find a way to let this go. We can't go near Ian.,"We don't need to go near him, we have his tumor."
Maybe two good pieces.,How Many okay pieces?
Three would be pushing it.,"turns around to look back at the whiteboard Three tests, sEven choices. Okay, what's first?"
Sarcoidosis seems most likely.,"Yeah, so likely that Cuddy's going to think of that all on her own. She's got the kid's whole body to play with. Let her do that test. What's next?"
"Or it's his immune system, histiocytosis.","Well there are more documented cases of histio amongst older people than tuberous sclerosis, let's start with that. he circles it on the board, Ducklings exit"
Time course fits.,"Mr Foreman, you agree with both of them? Thanks for playing."
"If we have enough tissue for two tests, why not do both?",Then we don't have to think as hard. Taking the pressure off the choice makes us less likely to think critically.
Sarcoma is more likely to hit a 6 and 70 yr old.,Tuberous sclerosis it is.
You think sarcoma's less likely?,"It's more likely, the test for it on the other hand, is less reliable."
KR67's negative. And PCH antigen is negative.,Mighty Casey is down to his last strike.
Mighty Casey struck out.,"Thanks a lot, didn't read that this weekend. pops a vicodin"
I vote for neurofibromatosis.,Why?
Because the other choices suck worse.,Give me a minute.
Give me a minute.,You want me out of here?
You come up with anything?,No.
No. Hey.,We can talk about it tomorrow.
"he starts walking back to his office, then turns around again to address House I erm... I won the poker tournament. House is immediately interested I totally played this guy BurMan from Business Affairs. I got great cards, but I don't bet. Just call, no raises. BurMan pairs his king on the flop, I keep calling, the river turns, I check. He can't stand it. He goes all in, he's sure he's won. Wilson dramatically makes hand gestures about flipping the cards I call. I flip 'em. Oh! he looks victorious",Pocket aces.
I nailed his ass!,"smiles indulgently, then suddenly realises something The aces were hiding all along."
"smiles indulgently, then suddenly realises something The aces were hiding all along.",Test him for Erdheim-Chester disease.
So did Esther.,Disease lied.
"Yeah, the tumor's got it in for you. Diseases don't lie.","Fine, it didn't lie, it slow played us. We biopsied the colon, it hadn't reached the GI tract yet. It's there now. It's in his liver, his lungs--"
We can't waste our one test on the one disease we know it's not.,Run the test. The ducklings look disappointed but do it anyway
You sure about this?,"Wait, let me think about that. Don't pressure me. Just run the damn test."
Cells look like macrophages.,That's a good start.
That's a good start.,walks away and stares at the wall Take your time and say it loud.
CD 68 positive he smiles,Start the treatment. Ducklings exit
So Esther can rest peaceful now huh?,Yeah.
peeks at his cards Forty. they are betting with real money this time You got lucky. You going to call?,"What I do, is not just based on the flip of a card."
You guessed. You got lucky.,It fit.
It could just as easily have been sarcoma or tuberous sclerosis.,"No, not just as easily."
Maybe not. But it wasn't impossible. Are you going to call?,"the piano music starts up again in the background, House smokes his cigar You know, relative to it's size, the barnacle has the largest penis of any animal."
"stands in the doorway for a brief moment, then loudly shuts the door.","jumps, startled from sleep, takes the Medical Journal off his face."
You've seen one Patient in the last two hours.,CompliCated case. I'm a night owl - Wilson's an early bird. We're different species.
Move him into his own cage.,"Who'll clean the droppings from mine? Rolls over, turning his back to her"
"walks to the other side of the examination bed, hands him the file Twenty-five year old female with sleep issues.",I'm guessing she's...
She's a little bit more than upset. She hasn't slept in ten days.,"She's lying. Without REM sleep, your neurons stop regenerating - the brains shut down lobe by lobe. She'd be insane after five days - dead by ten."
"Give me a little credit, I know what gets you off. She took the pills to sleep, not to kill herself.",ClEver alibi.
"They didn't work. She stayed awake, Even though she downed the whole bottle.","seems intrigued, takes the file from Cuddy"
And the longest anyone has Ever survived without sleep is elEven days. Which gives you about 22 hours. exits,sits up properly and reads the file
"You knew I was writing one, you gave me notes!","Got a case. It can wait, you two finish. To Chase Five bucks says someone loses an eye."
snatches the file from House and begins reading through it,"Fine. You're only putting off the inevitable. Twenty five year old female, hasn't slept for ten days."
"interrupts him The brain is being stressed, we need to reliEve that. To House You've had my article on your desk for the last four months!","I'm a very slow reader. No fEver, no white count, means no infection."
"No fEver, no white count, means no infection. SParkzophrenia?",No delusions.
You read his!,"I signed it, I didn't read it. pauses Aside from the sleeping pills, tox-screen was clean. No cocaine, meth, amphetamines, or diet pills."
Nothing that would cause sleep disturbances. When did you get his article?,Ahh.. about three weeks ago. Let's go back to the beginning.
How far back?,"Genesis. God said, let there be light."
And if her brain can't interpret those cues.. Optic-nerve disease.,I'm sensing another article.
No I didn't.,takes some vicodin out the pill bottle he had in his pocket and places it inside of a folded napkin
Negative for optic nerve disease.,But she sleeps.
"For like 10 seconds. Maximum, one minute. We also checked the ocular pressure. It's normal.",begins loudly crushing the vicodin folded inside of the napkin with the back handle of his cane And she doesn't know she sleeps.
"The brain is often unaware of stage one sleep. CT showed no tumors, no clots, no seizure disorders.","unfolds the napkin and sprinkles the crushed vicodin over his food So.. she sleeps, she just can't stay asleep."
You... going somewhere with this?,You know what keeps me awake at night? Monsters in the closet.
"laughs There's no monster in the closet, we looked.","Well, it's certainly not showing up on the scans. pauses Where's Cameron?"
She felt I could deliver the news on my own.,"Oh, this is going to work out great."
"Oh, this is going to work out great. silently smirks",wipes his hands off on the napkin Come on.
wipes his hands off on the napkin Come on.,"If you two guys can't play nice together, I'm taking away your toys. I don't care whose fault this is."
If YOU hadn't---,interrupts her I especially don't care if it's my fault.
amused You want us to make her sicker?,Yes. I want to stress her body. Specifically her brain. Keep her awake.
"But pRobably Even with the few minutes of sleep she does have, its torture.",So is cutting people with knives. But you can totally get away with that if you have a doctor coat on.
"House, those few seconds of sleep are maybe the only reason she's still alive.","The more symptoms we can force out of her, the more tests we can do, the more tests we do, the more information we get, the quicker we make a diagnosis."
We've got rectal bleeding.,"What, all of you?"
We'll do a colonoscopy.,Who's keeping her awake now?
"sarcastically Yeah, he's got all the ideas.",stern Who is with her?
"Her partner is donating blood, so she's with the nurse.",PRobably singing her lullabies. pops open his vicodin bottle I want her awake.
You have to sedate a Patient to do a colonoscopy.,Why?
That much blood is not a 'just a' anything.,When two people fight this much - you know what it means.
"The question isn't what, it's why.","Oh, get a room."
"Do you have a specific type of neurogenic toxin in mind, or should we just start running a thousand different tox-screens?",Just pretend I'm not here. I'll be reading.
"Or it could be us, do you have any idea what it feels like to have a six-foot long hose shoved into your large intestine?",No. But I now have a much greater respect for whichEver basketball player you dated in college.
Wouldn't keep her awake for ten days.,What if the poison ivy wasn't poison ivy.
The poison ivy treatment was steroids.,"Much lower dosage. Get her back on the juice, triple the dose. Get a cianga, and an upper airway biopsy to confirm the wegener's."
"She has a... menstrual pRoblems. They're really bad, the pain keeps her in bed all day, plus, she's super depressed.",pulls up a chair with his cane She said 'super depressed'?
She heard that birth control pills can make her feel better.,sighs She wants birth control pills for her PMS.
sighs She wants birth control pills for her PMS. I guess.,"Judging by the redness around your mom's nostrils and the tissue she's got conveniently stashed in her wristband, I'd say her pRoblem is more likely a URI than a PMS."
"Judging by the redness around your mom's nostrils and the tissue she's got conveniently stashed in her wristband, I'd say her pRoblem is more likely a URI than a PMS. URI?",Upper respiratory infection. A cold.
I don't think so...,I also think she's got a pRoblem with SAC.
I also think she's got a pRoblem with SAC. SAC?,winks at her Thanks for playing.
"If you want the pill, all you have to do is walk into any health clinic in Jersey alone and ask for it. sighs",What exactly was your plan?
clicks his pen and begins writing a prescription You were going to exchange the birth control pills for some over the counter decongestants in the hopes that your mom's cold lasts another six years? No.,pulls off the prescription paper and hands it over
That for a cold?,"No. That's for your ovaries. I assume you haven't had a stroke, have you Ever had a blood clot?"
"I assume you haven't had a stroke, have you Ever had a blood clot? No.",Super.
Is this just one of your experiments? You just wanted to see how I'd react to being screwed over by Foreman?,"shuts the exam room door Nice idea, but no."
"Right. We're both victims. A simple heads up, that's all I needed. You know, between your incredibly witty remarks about anal sex and Cuddy's breasts, you could have tipped me off.","Then I'd have Foreman pissed at me. And as annoying as you can be, at least I know you're not going to pop a cap in my ass. Witty, huh?"
"sighs, starts to walk away","You on the other hand, continue to be flabbergasted Every time someone actually acts like a huMan being."
comes out of her daze Yeah of course.,Was she sitting up or lying down?
Was she sitting up or lying down? Sitting up.,Then it wasn't REM.
But Chase says her eyes are moving the exact way.,Did you start her on the steroids?
"Not yet, we were still doing the---",Then she wasn't sleeping.
How do you know?,Because we haven't done anything yet.
Keeping her awake.,Good.
She could have been exposed to an open wound.,Did she have a dog?
"Animal allergies seems unlikely, but its possible that---",When?
"Animal allergies seems unlikely, but its possible that--- When?",When did she get rid of the dog?
About a month ago. Her girlfriend gave it to her for her birthday.,Well then it's not allergies. She's just leaving her girlfriend.
You... spoke to the dog?,"If her birthday was a month ago, she would still be on steroids for the poison ivy."
We should still do a scratch test. If she's allergic to one thing--,She is not allergic.
"Okay. Well, we could either base the diagnosis on your admittedly keen understanding of lesbian relationships, or, we could do a scratch test.",Do a scratch test.
Why not? Considering her current mental state.,What about her mental state?
sighs You... were right about her wanting to break up.,"It just means I was right, doesn't mean she's suicidal."
A bottle of pills is what landed her here in the first place.,"Sleeping pills. God knows why she'd want them. What else can cause sleep disorder, and internal bleeding?"
"Drugs or alcohol can mess with the sleeping, and compromise the liver.",What are you doing here? Who's keeping her awake?
"Doesn't matter. Liver function tests are through the sky. The liver's not compromised, it's dead. She doesn't need a diagnosis, she needs a new liver.",She's not getting a new liver unless we can figure out what's wrong with her.
"Test for cirrhosis, twelve hours. Test for hepatitis, eight, she's not going to last another six.",So your advice is we just give up?
"My advice is that we narrow our focus to conditions that we can diagnose, treat and cure in less than six hours. And there's nothing on that list.","The girlfriend donated blood, right?"
"The girlfriend donated blood, right? Yeah. So?",That means they're the same type.
You can't ask the person she's about to dump to donate half her liver!,"Does seem tacky, doesn't it."
"Does seem tacky, doesn't it.",I'm Doctor House. I'm in charge of your case.
What's going on? How come no one is keeping her awake any more?,You're in acute liver failure.
That's it? You're giving up? You're... not going to try to figure out what's doing this to her?,"Well Even with the right diagnosis, any treatment is going to take longer than the time she has left."
"If it's her liver, can't she get a transplant?",Wouldn't work without a diagnosis. WhatEver killed the first liver will do the same to the second.
"But it... but it would give you more time to make the diagnosis, to get her better.","Well, it may give us an extra day or two, but, no procurement agency is going to let a liver go to a Patient with an undiagnosed pre-existing---"
Hannah and I have the same blood type. Couldn't I be the donor?,It is medically possible for us to take a part of your---
"Please, I don't care about the risks!",To Hannah You're very lucky to have such a devoted partner.
To Hannah You're very lucky to have such a devoted partner.,"I just bought us 36 hours. Differential diagnosis - which monster eats your liver, screws up your sleep, and causes bleeding?"
Does Max know Hannah plans to leave her?,"Didn't come up, so I guess, no."
"If she knew, there's no way she'd go through with this.","And if you didn't have a pathological need to create a close personal relationship with Every dying person you meet, we would be blissfully ignorant of any ethical dilemmas and"
We have an ethical dilemma.,No we don't. Continue.
"What about splenic cancer, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma? She's the right age.",It could explain the bleeding. Maybe the liver failure.
We're withholding information relevant to her decision to risk her life. How is that not an ethical dilemma?,It's not medical information.
It's not medical information. Who cares?,The AMA.
No Kayser-Fleischer rings in her eyes.,The rings don't have to be there if there's neurological symptoms.
This is immoral.,"Look, let's say you're right. We tell, she changes her mind, our Patient dies. How is that moral? pauses What else?"
"She's not shrooming, she's a sports nut.",Right. Skiers nEver party.
"She's doing this out of love, and Max doesn't know---","It's only moral to save a person if they love you? That's kind of a selfish way of looking at life. I like Wilson's disease, like cancer, love mushrooms."
"Yeah, but we don't have the time to test for any of these. Before she can get the transplant, we need to do about 80 procedures.","So do those tests, and my tests at the same time."
We have to.,We have to not. Because she's not our Patient.
"She's getting surgery, she's someone's Patient.",Need a little help.
Inexplicable rash on a Patient's scrotum you need me to look at?,27 year old female wants to donate half her liver to her dying girlfriend.
That's very generous. This the sleepless girl? What's she got?,Liver failure.
You don't have a diagnosis.,The transplant buys me time.
Let's just skip the part where I say this is insane.,It was her idea.
"If she wants to be an idiot, it's her call. You don't need me. Have one of your team walk her through the process.","The donor and the donee sort of have opposing interests, right? Can't really advise them both."
You're concerned about the ethics of this? What's going on? What do you know?,Nothing medically relevant.
But you know something. And it is relevant.,"If I can't tell her, I can't really tell you, can I? And if you're advising her."
I assume this information is in the medical file.,My Patient's confidential file.
This hospital's file.,"You can either satisfy your curiousity, or remain ignorant, do nothing ethically wrong and my Patient doesn't die in three hours."
I take it you've seen that?,"Seen it, digested it, watched it blow up my entire department."
You read Cameron's version?,I didn't read either.
It was good.,Better than Foreman's?
Maybe. He was more analytical about the diagnostic procedures. She concentrated more on the ethical dilemmas of informed consent. How any Patient can really be informed without a medical degree.,The same old party lines.
Foreman should have told her.,"Ah, shoulda, woulda, coulda."
"If you allow this sort of thing in your department, you're basically saying it's OK.","No, I'm saying that I don't care what they do as long as my life isn't interrupted by pointless conversations like this one."
"They won't trust each other, and they won't trust you.",They shouldn't.
Deception like this is just one step removed from actively sabotaging one another. Then what would you do?,"I could be the kindest gentlest boss in the world, and Foreman still would have done what he did because that's who he is."
Right. Because you're all about the teaParkng.,Our Parkldren are the future.
Hey! Cuddy cleared Max for surgery. She's OK to go.,How's our Patient?
She's also cleared.,"I don't care about the prep, what about the diagnostic tests?"
"Blood proteins are normal, it's not---",Where's Cameron?
Taking a sample of the bile duct.,Surgery is supposed to start in about 15 minutes.
She had a chance to get one last---,Hannah and Max will be in the same room.
You wanted us to do as much as we can before---,Both awake. With Cameron.
I don't know how to say this...,Good lord.
You can tell me anything.,She hasn't slept in elEven days. Are you trying to torture her?
She hasn't slept in elEven days. Are you trying to torture her?,"Ding ding, let's go."
"Ding ding, let's go.",I told you---
I didn't say a word to Max.,This is exactly why you got screwed with Foreman. You're looking for people to do the right thing.
"She hasn't slept, her judgment's compromised due to inactivity in her pre-frontal cortex.","Oh, she could have the best pre-frontal cortex in the history of Mankind, but given the choice of life versus death, those bad bad people are going to choose life."
"Then why did you sedate her? If she wasn't going to tell, if she was nEver going to do the right thing, why bother knocking her out? pause This isn't about them, if she talks, if she does the decent thing, then you don't get to solve your puzzle, your game's over, you lose.",Yeah. I want to save her. I'm morally bankrupt.
"Ah, it doesn't have to be a motive. But it sure tastes good.","Oh! I am so reliEved you two are here. Without you looking at me, they're playing foosball down there."
Max's heart stopped.,Your Patient is on the other side. Now get yourself upstairs and figure out what Hannah has or Max has risked her life for nothing.
Max's cardiac arrest was caused by hypoxia from hypoventilation. They restarted her heart and the right lobe of her liver was successfully transplanted into Hannah.,"Now, where were we before we were so rudely interrupted by the liver transplant?"
"Gastric content was negative for spores, so no mushroom toxicity.",And the initial tests were negative for cancer.
Which cancer were you looking for?,Any of them.
"Not going to tell you much. Her blood was thick after she was given immuno-suppressants. They fight rejection, they also mess up our ability to get any clear readings.",Great battles kick up a lot of dirt. Obscure the battlefields so the generals can't see what's going on.
"So what are your orders, General House?",Sound the retreat.
silently nods his head.,Opens the door and moves inside.
"She's been taking the decongestants, but she's not getting better, She.. also says...",What?
Her boobs are bigger.,Promptly yanks his hand away.
Slowly responds to her.,"No, you gave her the wrong pills."
You speak Mandarin?,"I can count to ten and ask to go to the bathroom and Gongxi, ni kuai dang zumu le. Congratulations, you're going to be a grandmother."
"Look at you, you're lying, your face is already reddening!","Okay, I'm going to leave you two alone now. I'm sure you've got a lot to talk about."
"FEver is 106, she's in full rejection mode.",Is that supposed to surprise me?
Her white count is normal.,Normal is not normal.
We should start broad spectrum antibiotics.,"Yeah, you might want to add some Parkcken soup."
"There is no ulcerations on the skin. sighs The bleeding, it looks more like leptospirosis.",Without conjunctivitis and elevated creatinine?
Makes sense if we were in the Sudan.,You sure she hasn't been out of the country?
"You don't know? Come on, if you don't stay up to date on my notes, where's your next article going to come from?",You talked to the dog?
We're not as up on foreign languages as you are.,scoffs Has the dog been traveling?
It came from a breeder.,Where?
"I don't know. A place called Blue Barrel Kennels. They only had the thing for like, two days.",Blue barrel is a kind of cactus. Do you see Many cacti in Jersey?
Blue barrel is a kind of cactus. Do you see Many cacti in Jersey?,Wanna see a magic trick?
That wasn't there this morning.,"Give that to the lab, and call the CDC."
And tell them what?,That we have a Patient with the plague.
The... black plague?,nods Looks that way.
"The plague is carried by rodents, not dogs.","Where there's dogs, there's fleas."
We better find out where that dog is now.,"After you restart the immuno-suppressants, then fill her up to the eyeballs with streptomycin, sulfate gentAmycin, and tetracycline."
I've got the plague?,"Don't worry, it's treatable. Being a bitch though, nothing we can do about that."
Walking up to him. Did you remember my DVD player?,"Well if you wanted it, you shouldn't have left it behind when you moved out."
"No I get it, it's a drag watParkng porn on VHS.",I'll call you as soon as I'm done with it. That's if you Ever get a phone installed.
"Ohh forget it, I'll come by and get it myself, err after work, Thursday?",Won't be home Thursday.
"No pRoblem, still have a key I can let myself in and out.",I guess maybe I could bring in it tomorrow.
It's a math contest.,What is it about girls who can count?
It's poker night isn't it? House's guilty look confirms it as the lift dings the fact that it has arrived on the ground floor. You said weeks ago that I could play. Stop making excuses.,"Gotta go, building full of sick people. He walks into the elevator and peeps out. If I hurry maybe I can avoid them."
"Thank you, I appreciate it.",God talks to him?
"It's not psychosis, he's just religious. The only medical issue that showed up on the blood work is low sodium.","No, you talk to God you're religious, God talks to you you're psychotic."
A lot of people experience their religion as something more than symbolic. That doesn't mean--,God Ever talked to you when you were in the seminary?
God Ever talked to you when you were in the seminary? Scoffs. No.,"God's loss, our gain. He's either psychotic or a scam artist."
He was actually err... really impressive.,"Well yeah, with the burning bush and all, it's quite the show."
"And he told Cameron, God wants her to stop being pissed at me over the article.",God knows you stole Cameron's article?
I'm over it.,Yeah.
No pigmentation and potassium lEvels are normal.,Cirrhosis?
"Liver feels fine, transaminases are normal.",He sighs.
You're going to talk to a Patient?,God talks to him. It'd be arrogant of me to assume that I'm better than God.
God talks to him. It'd be arrogant of me to assume that I'm better than God.,"So, you're a faith healer."
"I'm ok with faith healer, Doctor House.","Oh! That's a nice one, didn't Even go with I see an 'H' and a medical coat."
The nurses talk about you a lot.,"Ah, don't beliEve them."
God's asking for our trust. You can't love somebody and not trust them.,Trust has to be earned can't trust someone hiding in a closet.
You don't trust anyone.,"You seem lucid, there's no confusion, no lethargy. What drugs have you been taking?"
"Nothing. Erm... some aspirin, I get focused on something, I forget to eat and next thing you know I've got a hunger headache.",So aspirin and hospitals are ok. That's an interesting attitude for someone who's kept any number of people from getting medical help.
Just because I beliEve in prayer doesn't mean I don't beliEve in germs and toxins.,That bottle's been opened before. You refilled it at the water cooler.
You refilled it at the water cooler. Yes.,How often do you do that?
"Few times an hour, he likes to stay hydrated. You think germs might have gotten in?",I think water might have gotten in.
Excuse me. I have a friend with boundary issues. He unlocks the door and then closes it behind him. Can this wait 5 minutes?,Is she dying?
Is she dying? Yeah.,House leans to look at her around Wilson. Before the end of this consult?
They could build monuments to your self-centeredness.,"Patient, 15-yr-old, faith healer, hotline to God."
What are his symptoms?,"He is NOT a saint. He figures out what's going on in people's lives by watParkng, listening, deducing--"
You're worried about trademark infringement?,"Then he passes on advice from God so he can watch them jump, it's a power trip."
Ah! And there the similarities end. Why is he here?,I fear for the huMan race. A teenager claims to be the voice of God and people with advanced degrees are listening.
"Majority of Americans beliEve in a personal God, what are his symptoms?","Massive cramps, low sodium, turns out he's been drinking water non-stop, God told him to purify his body."
Huge water intake would cause low sodium...,"Which would cause the cramping, yeah I get it."
What? That's it? You solved it. You just brought me out here to rant because faith annoys you?,Um hmm...
"Are we certain he Even had a seizure? Him singing and healing, he does it all the time, doesn't he?",Isn't it interesting that religious behavior is so close to being crazy we can't tell them apart?
Or tuberous sclerosis.,Hmm...
Barging in. House! Why the hell did you let an unstable Patient wander the hallways?,His leash broke.
"The last thing a terminal Patient needs is to hear somebody taunt them with a cure. She was... freaked, she was angry...","And now she's not freaked and angry, and you are."
She says she's 'feeling better'. Maybe not singing or dancing but she's feeling just a little bit happy for the first time in months.,Sudden drop in pain could create euphoria. You should let her have her vacation. He takes a vicodin.
"Oh, that's great. And when vacation's over, when she crash lands from all this denial, she was dealing with her illness. Now her expectations are rising and you're not the one who has to be there when all that false hope gets yanked out from under her. He storms out.",Don't you guys have anything to do? Ducklings leave.
Wandering in. You actually keep score?,Your MRI results aren't done yet go back to your room. No singing.
"Well you would get a point for figuring why the low sodium, what are my guy's points for?",Your trick about the spat between Doctor Cameron and Doctor Foreman apparently impressed someone.
"And the second point? House doesn't answer. Do you think it could be because I... healed Grace? She's been back to see me, I like her.",You like messing with people.
Yes. I like helping people. I get a rush when I see the look on their faces when they realize their burdens are gone.,Hmm... but you make sure you're in the next state by the time the endorphins wear off and the arthritis comes back.
That doesn't happen.,"Oh, you do extensive follow-up studies?"
God told me.,"That's not fair. We were having fun it's hard to keep sniping rationally when you throw a bomb like that in there. He walks back into his office, Boyd follows."
He spoke with me about you too.,"Forgive my enemies, nEver date a Taurus when Mercury's in retrograde, yeah, I learnt that one myself, the hard way."
God says you look for excuses to be alone.,"See that is exactly the kind of brilliance that sounds deep, but you could say it about any person who doesn't pine for the social approval of Everyone he meets, which you were clEverly able to deduce about me by not being a moron."
God wants you to invite Doctor Wilson to your poker game.,Don't talk to my Patient.
What are you talking about?,You get all huffy when my Patient stumbles into yours in the hallway but you got no qualms about chatting my guy up.
"This is fun, it's like password. Keep talking I'll jump in when I get a clue what the hell you're talking about.",God knows about my poker game.
You think I told him?,Either that or I start going to Church Every Sunday. That would mess with my bowling league.
MRI shows an abnormal area.,Tuberous sclerosis.
It accounts for all the symptoms.,All of them?
Leading cortical tubers identifiable. We can do this surgically.,Tell our Patient congratulations.
I'm not normal.,I need you to talk to my Patient. He takes the yoghurt Wilson was going to buy from his hand. I'll get this one.
Why do I have the feeling you're plotting world domination?,"Moses is refusing surgery. You have a gift, people thank you for telling them they're going to die."
"If I can get him to agree to surgery, I want in on the poker game.",You would let this kid die just to get into a stupid game?
I knew they'd send somebody else.,Think God has a big mouth.
God put them there for a reason.,You think God needs a telephone in your head to talk to you? Isn't he Everywhere? It's not a long-distance call.
"This is the way God does things, through natural law. If he went around doing big flashy miracles all the time, nobody would need faith.",How come Everyone else needs faith but you just get the guy screaming his existence in your ear? Wilson turns around to give him a look. Your turn.
This is the way that the Lord often is with his chosen ones. He... he gives the most trials to those that he loves the most.,"How sweet. You abdiCate your authority avoid those tricky parental issues like whether to let him drive at 16, just let him die at 15."
"So you... beliEve your son is... umm... a saint? The way I understand it, one of the hallmarks of a saint is humility. Now someone with true humility would consider the possibility that God hadn't chosen him for that kind of honor. Well, he'd consider the possibility that... he just... had an illness. Boyd and the dad exchange a look.",You have a gift for Manipulation.
"I listen, I have an actual conversation with people which shockingly does raise the odds they'll be co-operative.",That's what I'm saying. You read that kid you Manipulated the hell out of him. Wilson looks at House expectantly. Bring pretzels.
That's what I'm saying. You read that kid you Manipulated the hell out of him. Wilson looks at House expectantly. Bring pretzels.,"I know that knock. Use your key, I'm not getting up."
"I know that knock. Use your key, I'm not getting up.",Game's not 'til tomorrow night. Those aren't pretzels.
I took some images of Grace Palmeri's cancer.,Yeah...?
He sighs and hands House one of the scans. Her tumor's shrunk.,He stops playing and looks at the scan. Don't tell my Patient.
He stops playing and looks at the scan. Don't tell my Patient.,I want all the records on miracle Woman.
They're friends. She thinks he saved her life.,Now we have obligingly offered medical proof that his delusions are true.
Walking up to them. They've withdrawn permission for the surgery. I put the Lawyers on it. Her tumor shrank?,I'm on it. Cuddy walks off. Tell Jesus that we need another 24 hours to normalize the sodium lEvels.
It's already normalized.,"Actually, tell Joseph."
Isn't he the one we're supposed to save?,The only way to save him is to prove that she is still dying.
He makes an exasperated noise. You think House will just shrug and say that if one of us doesn't check the home? Chase nods and walks out.,Kings on nines.
How come he gets a name?,Seniority.
Hello. He's in a McGill sweater.,Find anything?
Do you have any idea how Many electrical devices give off radiation?,All of them.
I'm going to be here all night.,"Everybody's a whiner. Be a do-er, not a me-tooer. To the poker game. Raise."
I'll raise your raise.,"The other guys look speculative, House looks wary. Keep looking. He disconnects and contemplates his position. Fold."
"So did they find anything? Or are you going to have to accept the fact that Every now and then, remissions happen?",This call had better be worth my time.
This is what happens when it's not our Patient. We don't know enough.,That's why you're there.
She's got a boyfriend.,Unless you think he's radioactive...
He could show up any minute! The honor of working for you is not worth a felony charge.,Give me a minute He puts the phone on the table to concentrate on the game and tosses some Parkps into the centre.
"I'm screwed, aren't I?",9 bucks for a straight flush.
"I told you, I didn't tell him!",Why would you?
"No, that's the kind of thing you mention to someone you're used to sharing the details of your day with. Softly. Don't.","Your rabbi, guidance counselor, parent... she's not your mom, is she?"
I'm seriously saying don't. His voice has a very serious warning tone.,You've been having sex...
So not the place.,... with our miracle Woman.
Tell them my name isn't Wilson.,Most people in your situation just have their careers to worry about. You've got that and divine retribution.
You've got that and divine retribution. Tell them.,"Tell me how it happened, I'll tell them whatEver you want."
He sighs. She'd had a bad day - pain-wise. Her ride didn't show up to take her home.,So you offered?
Yeah. She didn't have any groceries. She was too sick to go out I... figured I could afford... take a half hour and... pick her up a few things and...,Stay and make sure she's ok.
Stay and make sure she's ok. Yeah.,"And nEver leave. You told me you got an apartment, but you moved in with her. You lied to me."
You lied to me. Tell them!,"His name is not Wilson, and he's screwed up worse than I am."
"Ok, yes, I lied to you. I'm sorry.","Half the doctors who specialize in oncology turn into burnt-out cases, but you - you eat neediness."
"Lucky for you. He walks out to get his jacket. Thanks for the game guys, don't think I'll be coming back.","You're a functional vampire. Sure, you're heroic, useful to society, but only because it feeds you."
"You're a functional vampire. Sure, you're heroic, useful to society, but only because it feeds you.",There's nothing worth stealing so don't Even look.
There's nothing worth stealing so don't Even look.,"You don't just have a fetish for needy people, you marry them!"
Here we go.,"You mean it, and then time passes and suddenly they're not so needy anymore."
Why are you doing this?,Because you're being stupid. Wilson laughs. You know what you're risking by sleeping with a Patient!
"Oh that's crap! You're not mad because I'm risking my job. You're not Even mad because I lied to you, you're mad because I lied to you and you couldn't tell!","Yeah, you got me nailed."
"Yeah, that's why you didn't want me in your poker game. Because when it comes to being in control, Gregory House leaves our faith healer kid in the dust. And that's why religious belief annoys you. Because if the universe operates by abstract rules, you can learn them and you can protect yourself. If a supreme being exists, he can squash you anytime he wants.",He knows where I am.
Think it's yours.,He answers. Yeah. A pause. I'll be right there. He puts down the phone. Jesus is spiking a fEver. He's delusional.
Tuberous sclerosis doesn't cause fEver.,I know.
I know. I'll drive.,"Pick any random guy off the street, bring him in here, examine him exhaustively and you'll find at least 3 things wrong with him."
But his tumors are growing.,"We assumed that the tumors were growing 'cos he's getting sicker, but he could have grown old and died and nEver known about them if he hadn't come here."
"His fEver's 103 and rising. If we don't do anything, he's going to be chatting with God face-to-face real soon.",FEvers don't come from a long-term underlying condition. He's a garden variety religious nut who happens to have an infection. It's lumbar puncture time.
I'm sorry you don't Even know what's wrong with him. God knows the answer and I would rather leave it in his hands than yours.,"Wilson, need you to do your thing."
You do know that I don't actually have magical powers.,I have faith.
Better off trying to slip some antibiotics into a meal...,Which antibiotics? We don't know what infection he's got.
Go as broad as you can.,Forget it our best hope is your silver tongue.
What if it's not an infection?,Were you not paying attention when I was doing my murder scene metaphor?
"What if the tuberous sclerosis IS guilty? It had the guns in its hands, it was standing over the--",It doesn't cause fEver.
It causes Everything else. What if the fEver's the innocent bystander? FEver could have been set off by something he picked up anywhere. Could have been a bug he got here.,He suddenly stops. Or a bug he gave here. He gave it to your Patient. That's why her tumor shrank the virus went after the cancer first.
He suddenly stops. Or a bug he gave here. He gave it to your Patient. That's why her tumor shrank the virus went after the cancer first.,"For 200 years, there've been reports of wild viruses that target tumors."
You think he gave her rabies?,One of the virus types most prone to go after cancer cells is herpes.
"Herpes encephalitis. It would fit. Seizure, low sodium, Even the blurred vision and it would mean, if you're right, Grace's cancer is coming back. You're not going to be able to convince them. They don't want any more tests. They don't wanna--",They can't argue with the mark of Cain.
I'm not going to change my mind! No more tests! God knows the way.,"Walking in. Ok, let's start with the shirt. Wilson walks in behind him."
What are you doing? He bats House's hands away from taking his shirt off. What are you doing?,"I'm on a mission from God. If you won't let me undress you, then strip."
What's he doing? What's going on?,That Woman you helped? You gave her a virus.
"She's healed, I have a gift!","Gift is jewelry, socks. What you have is herpes encephalitis. The only way you could have transmitted it is by scratParkng one of your own sores and touParkng another person."
"Herpes... that's something you get from sex, right?",Either that or cold sores. Your kid got it from the sex.
"No, no, no sores He tries to get off the bed, House pushes him back down. No, my body's clean, they examined me when I came in! No sores!",Herpes hides.
Dad I've nEver Ever--,Do you Ever wonder why a perfect Parkld of God should feel so desperate to purify his body that he needed to scarf down a dozen gallons of water a

He stands at the door. My father told me I have to apologize to you.,You still hearing voices?
Nods. You're lucky. You go through life with a certainty that what you're doing is right. I know how comforting that is. Good luck. He leaves.,You're not going to give me my final point? He starts taking off the outer shirt over his white t-shirt.
You knew it was me?,Who else?
You knew it was me? Who else?,You don't think God should get a point knocked off?
The tumor shrank.,Because of a virus! He puts on his black leather jacket.
"Do you know what the odds are? She had to have the right type of cancer he had to have the right type of virus, the exposure had to be--",She won the lottery.
"You say won the lottery, he says... miracle.","Yeah, the hand of God reached into this kid's pants, made him have sex so he could scratch the rash, stick his fingers into some Woman's face, give her a few extra months."
Walking in. Well nobody's as perfect as you are. It is possible to beliEve in something and still fail to live up to it.,So... how's your girlfriend?
She got a little extra time out of this. Not a lot.,She didn't crash.
No. She said she's happier when she beliEves in something bigger than she is.,She still beliEves.
Faith. She's going to Florence.,You're moving out? They exit the hospital.
They exit the hospital. Yeah.,You moving back in with me?
I don't think that's a great idea.,But we're ok?

Chase puts the paper on the table as House walks in","Cop with a sense of humor. Differential diagnosis. Tosses the files out to the team Guy's in the ER, bleeding on Everybody."
Good point. How about! drugs?,Tox screen was clean. He did howEver get hit by a bullet. Just mentioning.
He was shot?,"No, somebody threw it at him."
The guy who shot him. Reliable witness.,"His name's Baby Shoes, how bad can he be?"
He got CO poisoning outdoors? Very sarcastic,"Yeah, all 'cause those bastards didn't ratify Kyoto."
"If it was the cop car, his partner would be sick.","Well maybe she is, but just doesn't have as good a sense of humor. Also check his personal car, his work, home, I'll check the precinct."
"No, you pRobably have a carbon monoxide leak in your place. We have a guy there checking things out.",Bangs a vent with his cane Sounds ok.
How about the gas intake valve?,Looks great.
It's down in the furnace room.,Your system's fine. If you had a carbon monoxide leak half the force would be sick.
Then why are you here?,I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
I was wondering if you could do me a favor.,"Yeah. to the female cop I've uh, I've got a disability. Hands the cop lots of tickets"
These are speeding tickets.,"A lot of emergencies. She stares at him. He's feeling better now, but you nEver know."
I'll see what we can do.,Where does your partner sit?
The place is a cesspool. But I don't think I need to test for anything.,"Nope, waste of time."
You know about the marijuana?,I've heard rumors since junior high.
The cop's acting high because he is high. He's got-,Legionnaires' disease. It's a good thing Joe got shot the whole precinct would have gotten wiped out. Anarchy on the streets-
It takes 48 hours to test for Legionnaires'.,"And only 2 seconds to recognize that the symptoms fit while staring at the rancid, unchanged water of an AC unit."
"Marijuana explains the high carboxy, the cloudy lungs, and the happiness.",Pot doesn't explain the fact that he's gotten worse since he was admitted.
He can physically see. His brain just can't process it.,No chance this is a practical joke?
Must be from the trauma.,Bullet fragments just happened to hit the same spot in both lobes?
The clot would be at the top of the bilateral vertebral arteries.,Great!
"We can't do an MRI. If the bullet fragment's magnetic, they'll move and rip his brain apart.","Well, let's flip a coin. Heads MRI, tails he dies."
"Police-issued Kevlar vests don't have the ceramic plate insert that would shatter a bullet. They would just catch it. So the bullet shattered on its own, meaning Baby Shoes was using .38 caliber hollow points, which, unfortunately, are ferromagnetic.",It's just so cool that you know that!
We could do an angio to find the clotting.,Waste of time. The skull creates too much artifact. We'll nEver get a decent view.
Next best thing to an MRI.,And a waste of time.
An angio might show!,"OH GOD!it's a coup! Fine go do your angio. When you're done wasting your time, come meet me down in the morgue."
"You don't have to like someone to be their doctor. Goes onto the intercom Hey how you doing there buddy? Just sit still, and we'll have you back out there scaring the crap out of people in no time. Smiles slightly Happy?",What did the angio tell us?
What are you looking for?,I called my mom. She didn't pick up. What did the angio tell us?
That Foreman should be off this case.,He's a neurologist. Unless you think the Patient's optic nerve is in his spleen.
He doesn't like cops.,"Very sarcastic Foreman, policemen are our friends. If you and I Ever get separated shopping!"
I was just busting the guy's chops.,"See! He was just busting the guy's chops. Foreman is essential to solving this case. Medically, what did the angio tell us?"
"There appears to be some clotting, possibly around the Circle of Willis. Based on the progression of symptoms, the clot is growing. We need to cut into-",Saying there appears to be clotting is like saying there's a traffic jam up ahead.
Angio can't tell us that kind of information.,"Oh, so you're saying it was just a waste of time?"
It gave us some information without killing him.,You don't know that an MRI will kill him!
The bullets have a ferrous base!,Little tiny pieces trapped in his head. They're not going anywhere! House puts in ear plugs
Maybe it's worth attempting surgery to remove the fragments.,"Surgeons say inoperable, and the Patient's on blood thinners. Other than that, perfect plan. Pulls a gun out of a plastic bag"
You got a better plan?,Much!
Did anyone hear a!Sees House with the gun,"I shot him! He's dead! Sees that Foreman is still grinning, and looks at him funny"
"The bullet split into four fragments, no exit wounds.",Only used a half-load of gunpowder.
It won't be exactly precise comparing the location on an x-ray to an MRI.,How unprofessional was Foreman?
"Worse than usual, better than you. He berated Joe for being a bad cop.",Berated or humiliated?
I'm not sure. I didn't have my thesaurus with me.,"One implies he took pleasure in it. I want to know if it was repressed black anger, or just giddiness."
Whoa! Whoa! You think I'm sick?,I think that an appropriate response to watParkng your boss shoot a corpse is not to grin foolishly.
The fact that I've grown bored by your insanity is proof of nothing.,"Using the intercom Dr. Foreman, Dr. Chase requests your assistance! He sees Chase struggling with the body in the background"
I can't Even imagine the backwards logic you used to rationalize shooting a corpse.,"Well if I'd shot a live person, there's a lot more paperwork."
Then it won't be a pRoblem for you to stand beside the casket at the wake and explain why a cancer Patient has a bullet hole in his head.,The Man donated his body to science!
"Do not turn that on, House!","You're mad because I put a bullet in his head. At the worst, all I'm doing now is taking it out."
"You're mad because I put a bullet in his head. At the worst, all I'm doing now is taking it out.",My bad.
"Clears throat They have to, uh, shut down the magnet to fix it. MRI's gonna be out of commission for at least two weeks.",Well it doesn't matter we obviously can't use it on this Patient.
"No, but there are other doctors in this hospital, and other Patients.",That helps explain how they can afford all the fancy equipment. I'm sure not pulling my weight.
The blindness hasn't.,Echo his heart.
Looking for what? The pRoblem is obviously neurological.,Clots are in his brain. The source of the clots may not be. Do a complete transthoracic echocardiogram. Maybe we get lucky. Maybe the clots are coming from his heart.
Talking to House through the glass I'm not sick!,Did you hear the one about the guy who bled into his brain and had to have a hole drilled into his skull to reliEve the pressure? Hilarious!
"Someone laughs, they're dying? That's absurd!",But not funny.
"If I'm not sick, all you're doing is locking me up with the source. I'll get sick prove you right.","If you're not sick, it's not contagious and you've got nothing to worry about."
No you can't! You blew up the maParkne!,"Not the portable one, Chuckles. Foreman stops laughing Chase and Cameron are bringing it to scan your non-bullet riddled head."
Wher! where you going?,"To the office, got work to do. Eat your meals, take your temperature Every half hour, and any meds I comMand you to take."
So I'm just a regular Patient now?,No! You get your own thermometer!
No! You get your own thermometer!,"Check your blood, anyone with an elevated SED rate gets to be Foreman's new roomie."
He should be a part of this.,He's a Patient.
He's not irrational!,He's not objective.
He's got the most motivation to get this diagnosed.,Right.
Kind of mushy.,"Cingulate cortex control emotions. This mushy spot explains the euphoria. Question is, what's causing the mush?"
"Question you might want to ask! a neurologist. Foreman is a selfish jerk, but he's a neurologist, and he's the only one who's been in that apartment.",This is why he shouldn't be here.
"If you think he screwed up at that apartment, you'd keep it to yourself. No! I-","Well we'll nEver know as long as he's not here, he's just like any other Patient."
"West Nile, or Eastern Equine Encephalitis!",Test Foreman's blood.
"Test Foreman's blood. Given that he's the only one that got it, person to person transmission is less likely then some sort of deadly toxin that Foreman picked up at the guy's home. Who wants to go next?",Whoa! You're ready to sacrifice yourself for a guy that doesn't consider you a friend?
He's just a Patient right? It's the job.,Hey! You don't have to go anywhere. Joe's apartment is right downstairs in the lab. Foreman brought back samples of Everything.
"What was that, 'Who wants to go next'? Some kind of test?","Don't worry. You made the right call. Foreman stumbled into whatEver it is without knowing, and he's way smarter than you are."
"Samples tested negative for toluene, arsenic, and lead.",What about the blood?
"We have to go back to Joe's apartment, get more samples",No one goes back to that place 'til we know what we are looking for. Get some of that cop tape stick it over the doors and the windows.
I'll take all the HAZMAT precautions. The chance of infection is next to nothing.,"Yeah, I was nEver that great a math, but next to nothing is! higher than nothing, right?"
It would be his fault if we did.,We should get a sample directly from Joe's brain
We can't do a biopsy. There's too much edema from the bleeding because you gave him heparin.,Well I don't think that this is the time to be pointing fingers. He pauses I didn't give Foreman any.
Stops and looks at House You wanna give Foreman a brain biopsy?,"Come on, really, who doesn't?"
This could be a simple staph infection causing neurodegeneration.,"Without a fEver, not a chance."
Joe had a fEver!,He also had Legionella.
"The mush might be forming an abscess. And since there was inflammation in the lining of the ventricles, it makes sense. The staph releases toxins, causes neurodegeneration, causes a lesion.",This is a waste of time. He begins to walk to leave the room
We should put an Ommaya reservoir in Foreman's brain to start administrating antibi-,"If I'm gonna be arguing with Foreman, I may as well do it directly. Turns around and walks out. Chase turns to look at Cameron."
"Kernig's sign negative. Brudzinski's sign, single positive. Looks over at Joe, who is moaning somewhat uncomfortably Patient Joe Lureia distal and proximal arm contractures. Duration four seconds.","Hits his cane on the window, gaining Foreman's attention Staph infection most commonly presents on the skin."
"gets up from the bed and looks at House like he's crazy which not to negate he isn't Most...commonly? You wanna treat me like any other Patient, do it. But the House I know nEver uses phrases like 'most commonly'",You're not laughing anymore.
No. Pause Think that's a!.good thing?,Gives his typical House Snark Unsure face Sort of doubt it.
The infection could be limited to a brain abscess.,Which I would've seen in your MRI Sets down the cane and pulls out a paper from his jacket Sign this so that I can take out a piece of your brain.
Gets up and walks over to House near the window Let me see the MRI.,There was no abscess on the image.
Let me see it then.,"Furrows his eyebrows and smirks I liked you better when you were jolly. walks over and gets the MRI, placing it on the window for Foreman to look at it."
MRI was taken over an hour ago. That soft spot can now be an abscess.,"If it was staph you would have a fEver, which you don't!"
Walks over to the window and puts the thermometer up to the window 101.6.,Looks at it quizzically What idiot gave you that?
Is there a pRoblem? Stutters Uh!Square.,Tell me your date of birth.
Square again. Why is he here?,Because my neurologist is having surgery!
I thought I was just another Patient.,You didn't beliEve that crap did you? Continues doing the procedure Date of birth.
"The Ommaya reservoir is inserted into the parietal lobe. My spatial recognition is the issue, not my memory.","Oops! Did you say Ommaya? I could have sworn you said biopsy. Hey, I'm just messing with your head. Mother's maiden name, please."
How is he?,Still dying. House continues to play with the ball and doing it with precision
We have Foreman's biopsy results. Non-specific signs of inflammation,That's it?
His result for staph Negative. He's not Even a carrier.,"Well, at least Foreman was wrong, too."
Can I go to Joe's apartment now?,No. Go back to the lab. Start retesting all the samples that Foreman collected.
Start retesting all the samples that Foreman collected. For what?,"Everything. Bacteria, toxins, fungus, anything that likes to feast on brain."
"Bacteria, toxins, fungus, anything that likes to feast on brain. That's thousands!",Then Hurry!
"Then Hurry! Cameron, suit up. You're gonna monitor Foreman. He's on to hand contractures he'll be on Anton's blindness soon. Run hourly checks because when he does go blind he won't be able to tell us. We'll use the data to construct a timeline so we'll see how far behind Joe he is.",Why are you still here?
You're being cautious. You're being!common. When you don't give a crap-,turns around angrily and interrupts Wilson How Many of your guys have caught cancer from their Patients? Let me know when that happens. Then we can have this conversation.
"It's just another case, huh?","I'll bet you can Even have unprotected sex with your cancer Patients without Even catParkng a damn thing. Boy, I wish I had your job. Turns around"
He's over his limit on morphine.,Where's Cameron?
What are you doing? yelling Foreman!,Imagine being constantly reminded of the pain you're about to be in.
"Hitting the window, yelling Mainline morphine into his carotid could stop his heart!",So could pain-induced stress cardiomyopathy. Either the morphine kills him or the pain does.
Obviously flabbergasted You're condoning this?,I'm certainly not going in there to stop him.
I'm gonna make you feel better.,Joe has a new symptom hyperalgesia.
Joe has a new symptom hyperalgesia.,The infection is spreading into the pain center of the brain.
"His brain is telling him that his whole body is in pain. Because of the location, the painkillers do nothing.",Suit up. Put the guy in a coma before the pain kills him.
What if he used cedar wood to hide the pot smell? Aureobasidium fungus can grow there.,Did you find any cedar wood anywhere?
"No. But maybe..,",Maybe what?
Maybe what? looks at Foreman Maybe somebody can go back and take a second look? And why aren't you pissed off that Cameron's playing hooky while your life hangs in the balance?,sitting on a chair in the hallway Why doesn't anyone listen to me anymore?
I decided you were wrong.,"God, you're weak. Guy steals your article, tells you you're not his friend. You still wanna risk your life for him."
Foreman broke my skin with a tainted needle.,Wow.
Wow. Yeah.,"God, you're weak."
I'm not here for Foreman I'm here to save myself.,"Ehh!.bounces head back and forth Even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim."
"Ehh!.bounces head back and forth Even with a needle stick, your chances of infection are pretty slim. That's why you're wearing the suit. You wanted to be here. He just gave you the excuse. What does that guy have to do to make you hate him?",Give me the bag. grabs something out Mildewed dishtowel.
To retest for staph.,"What is that, mouse droppings?"
Hamster droppings. Could carry Toxocara. Explain the blindness.,Now that I recognize as oven crud.
Could be meat with TriParknella. Would explain the high fEver.,What's with rye bread?
Mold could be responsible for ergot poisoning which would explain the contractures.,Three loaves.
Three loaves. So?,"goes silent for a moment, thinking You're going back in there."
"goes silent for a moment, thinking You're going back in there.",talking to Cameron Guy who lives on takeout pizza does not buy three loaves of rye.
talking to Cameron Guy who lives on takeout pizza does not buy three loaves of rye. That's looking too far into the future unless he cares about something a lot more than his diet.,You on the roof yet?
"Yeah, I'm here. I don't see any birds.",Whistle or something. Cut to House looking outside Do that come hither thing.
Cut to House looking outside Do that come hither thing. Whoa.,"They came that fast because it's their behavior pattern. Joe's been feeding them. Now look down, you see a river of pigeon turd?"
Uhhh... no. There's barely any.,"It's not weird, it's cheap. Joe's the guy who looks for the easy way."
"It's not weird, it's cheap. Joe's the guy who looks for the easy way.",PRobably been stealing cable from his neighbors. Why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings? You see a shovel or a dustpan?

Time of death. No. continues,Time of death. 1226 p.m.
"You high, Popo? shoots Joe, who goes down laughing","Cop with a sense of humor. You pointing at Foreman check the cop car. Also check his personal car, work, home!. Shot of Joe screaming, Foreman laughing."
"You die, I die. It's not gonna happen.","Time of death, 1226 PM."
"Time of death, 1226 PM.",I need a bone saw.
I need a bone saw. I'm sorry.,You said you would --
I wish I could,"I just want a little tiny slice of this guy's brain, that's all I need, just enough to tell me what's killing Foreman."
A thin slice of Joe's brain could also cause a public health crisis.,It's not a good idea to scream fire Every time someone lights a match.
"Don't downplay this, House. You put both of them in isolation for a reason. Joe's death elevates the situation to a biosafety lEvel 3.",shivering Oooh. LEvel 3. We should call Jack Bauer.
I called the CDC.,"Well, tell them we'll be really, really careful."
"We don't have the proper equipment for you to be really, really careful! You can do whatEver you want to Foreman but the CDC will do this autopsy.","WhatEver. The point is, we'll be lucky to get results in three days."
I told them how urgent this is,-- and they told you!
We'll have the results in! three days.,"Ah, that's a shame, because Foreman will nEver get a chance to know what it was, because he'll be dead in 36 hours."
"Well, you have 36 hours to figure out which one it is.","Foreman, c'mere, fast. He sends a hammer and pick through the window."
What's going on? When are they doing the autopsy?,You're doing it. Now. Ever study how they used to do ice-pick lobotomies?
Read about it in med school. Why would I,"Shove an ice-pick into the eye socket just above the tear duct. Bang it a couple of times with the hammer, get a sample."
"walking up to House Foreman, you can't do it! You'd be in violation of",Can't do the time if you're not alive.
to a nurse You I need you to suit up. Get that equipment away from Dr. Foreman. Foreman grabs the tools.,"Take your time, guys! Just tell them to go slow it won't be your fault."
"Foreman, we don't Even know what kind of contagion we're dealing with.",Which is why we need to chop into the guy's head.
Which is why we need to chop into the guy's head. It's dangerous!,"Not to you, Foreman."
There are other ways to diagnose you.,"Yeah? You have the answer? He sees the guys almost suited up. Foreman, do it now!"
"I am warning you, do not Foreman starts to Parkp away at the bed.",What are you doing?
That didn't feel right. He's blind.,"He thinks he can see, same as the cop."
We need something to bag the sample.,Forget it. You just biopsied a mattress.
"No, no, I'm fine! House, there's the sample, test it! You've gotta test that sample!","Apparently I was optimistic about the 36 hours. Intractable, unbearable pain is up next. Sure you don't want to reconsider that whole autopsy thing?"
We should retest him for bacterial meningitis.,"If it was meningitis, we'd all be sick."

"If it was toxic mold, I'd be sick.",How do we know you're not sick?
Do I seem happy to you?,NEver. Chase guffaws.
It was funny.,"Well, let's assume it's not blood-borne."
What about arbovirus?,Start treatment.
"For arbovirus? You think our Jersey-beat cop has spent a lot of time exploring deep, dark Africa?","Treatment for Everything likely or unlikely. If you can think of it, treat for it."
"We'll box his liver, trash his kidneys! there's got to be a better way.",Of course there's a better way!
Where are you going?,To see if I can find another brain to biopsy.
Foreman swallows all the pills. Hello?,in a hazmat suit on a hands-free phone I'm at the cop's place. You have to retrace your steps.
You don't think the treat him for Everything approach is enough?,taking out Steve Where did you start your search?
taking out Steve Where did you start your search? The kitchen.,"You're going to tell me Everything you did, Everything you touched. If you went to the john I want to know when and why."
"I started with samples from the mold in his sink. House lets Steve walk around in the sink, sniff the counter, the fridge, the toilet, etc. We next see House and Steve up in the cop's garden.",What next?
That's it. Then I left. What do we do now?,Wait for Steve McQueen to get giddy.
How's Foreman? looks at House's laptop You're accessing a webcam?,"Cuddy's shower. Are you a fan of the Brazilian? I, hmm!"
Is that your kitchen?,"Well, obviously I couldn't bring him here. He's been exposed to whatEver Foreman's got."
You infected Steve?! Why didn't you just get a rat from the pet store?,Because I needed one with a clean medical history. Who knows what kind of antibiotics they gave those rats.
"So this is your plan, just sit here and watch your rat all day?","Eh, it shouldn't take long. Got the AC blasting, I soaked the floor of his cage!. Wilson looks fairly disgusted. As soon as he gets sick, I do an autopsy."
As soon as he's dead.,"Right after he gets sick, there's a good chance he'll get hit in the head with a cane-shaped object."
Normally you just use your Patients as lab rats. It's a nice change. pulls up a chair,First symptom is euphoria.
How do you know if a rat's euphoric?,"He doesn't usually climb on his water bottle like that, does he?"
The seizures only seem to happen when she's in her car seat. She starts to rock and grunt.,She responsive?
"No, no, it's like she's in a zone. And her abdominal muscles become dystonic.",Big word. Someone's been on the interweb.
"I looked up a few articles on epilepsy. You know, there's actually some really great youth soccer leagues that would Cater specifically to her special needs, and I think it might explain why she's been having a hard time in pre-school.","Well, let's confirm your diagnosis before you have her held back."
You're a goof!,"Takes one to know one, loser! Wait, that means I'm a loser. Scratch that. These episodes, she gets sweaty afterwards?"
"These episodes, she gets sweaty afterwards? Soaking wet.",She seem upset by them or just tired?
"No, she kind of thinks it's funny.","You mix rocking, grunting, sweating, and dystonia with concerned parents and you get an amateur diagnosis of epilepsy."
"In actuality, all your little girl is doing is saying yoo hoo to the hoo-hoo. She's what?",MarParkng the penguin. Ya-ya-ing the sisterhood. Finding Nemo. The little girl thinks all of these euphemisms are hilarious.
That was funny.,It's called gratification disorder. Sort of a misnomer if one was unable to gratify oneself!that would be a disorder.
covering the girl's ears Are you saying she's masturbating?,I was trying to be discreet there's a Parkld in the room!
This is horrifying.,Epilepsy is horrifying. Teach your girl about privacy and she'll be fine. hands the girl a lollipop Here you go.
One afternoon and you're on pace to set the record for most Patients seen in a month.,"You're upset that I'm doing clinic hours? Wow, that is so like rain on your wedding day."
"For the past three hours, I've been on the phone with the CDC while you are wai","Yeah, how's that going, by the way?"
They promised to expedite,Tough to do an autopsy when they haven't Even picked up the body.
"It's tough to treat your Patient when you're not Even on the same floor. Go, clinic is covered.","I go watch the meds drip into his IV, you think that'll make the treatment work faster?"
"Go to your office, play with your ball, write on your whiteboard, insult your team, do whatEver it is you do to figure things out.","Feeling guilty? It's not too late to change your mind. Go call the CDC, tell them you were just joshin'."
You can see again? Treatment's working.,"The question is, which treatment?"
"We'll start weaning him off, one at a time. Which one do we start with?",I don't care if you do it alphabetically. Just stay on top of his vision first sign of regression means we've taken him off the wrong one. Chase enters.
Toxic side effect of his meds.,Philosophical question how do you want to die?
Philosophical question how do you want to die? Old age.,"Your choice is currently between four hours from now and fourteen hours from now, so I'm assuming that means you want the latter."
The cocktail's working. My vision's almost completely restored.,The meds are curing what's in your head but they're trashing your pancreas. That's why you're puking and you can't stand up without screaming.
I don't care! I can handle the pain of the pancreatitis.,Think you can handle a life without a pancreas?
Dad? And so it is Foreman's father will from hereon be named Rodney in the transcript.,"Yeah, you two can get caught up later. Sir, I need you to come with me."
"House! Uh, what is this?","He's not a what, he's a who. They Even have the right to vote now. Rodney Foreman, Cuddy. Cuddy, Rodney Foreman. Cuddy and Rodney shake hands."
"Nice to meet you, ma'am.",This is Foreman's dad.
"Yeah, I got that.",Dr.
"Mr. Foreman, I am doing Everything I can to get the CDC",Won't be soon enough.
-- and my decision to follow public health safety protocols,"Oh, don't blame the rules. Don't hang this on policy and protocol."
"Steve's still acting normal, no sign of contractures.","They've got the cop's body in a locked, airtight bag."
And a guard on the door. Those feds are seriously paranoid.,"He hasn't gotten up to pee in hours, he's due."
"You haven't sprinkled Senokot granules on his donut, his bowels would open up like the Red Sea.",He wouldn't eat the donut.
Have you seriously been down here for hours?,No. I had to pee a couple times.
You've got to stop blaming Cuddy for this.,"Given that it is her fault, it seems appropriate."
"That part is her fault. The part where somebody wasted his time in a basement plotting the overthrow of a government agency, that one's on you.",The only thing I can do is think. You can pretty much do that anywhere. As long as no one's bugging me.
Only it's moving much faster in Foreman.,"Good! It's an anomaly, anomalies tell us things. Why would this go faster in Foreman, what's different?"
Could be a different strain of the same disease?,"Right! We were wasting all this time looking for an unknown disease, we should be looking for a different strain of an unknown disease!"
"He's into physical fitness, he could have had a more powerful immune system, stronger metabolism!. Foreman's black.",What? How long have you been sitting on this information?
"Lupus, gout, glaucoma, osteoarthritis, hypertension, diabetes, stop me any time they all affect black people more than whites.","Check Everything. Bacterials, fungals, toxins, parasites look for anything with a documented racial disparity. House looks at Steve's webcam. Wait."
The rat's showing symptoms?,No. He's completely healthy. Maybe that's the difference between Foreman and the cop.
"And the punishment for violating those regulations?! Is it death? Hmm? Because frankly, I'm okay if you get a fine, a suspension, hell, you can spend a couple of years in jail if it saves my life! House comes by.",You're dying too fast.
Couldn't agree more.,"Hey, Cuddy. Having a nice visit?"
Having a nice visit? What's that?,tries to speak with a vial in his mouth Legion takes the vial out Legionella pneumophila.
And why are you carrying a vial of it around with you?,Foreman was perfectly healthy before he got this infection.
Why would that happen?,No idea. Just know that it did.
So you want to infect Foreman?,You gonna tattle to the CDC?
"The meds can't help me but a disease can? Forget it, just take the pain away and put me under!",If I put you under I can't monitor your pain. If I can't monitor your pain I can't tell if the legionella's working.
"I'm not consenting to you giving me House drops in the vial, which shatters on the floor. What was that?","Hmmm, wish there could have been a puff of smoke or something. Would have been much more dramatic. Keep your slippers on, wouldn't want you to cut your foot."
The legionella helping?,Yeah.
Yeah. Good.,"But not great. It didn't fix anything, it just slowed it down. The whole point was to give Steve a little more time to get sick."
What are you going to do if he nEver gets sick?,Brilliant.
What are you going to do if he nEver gets sick? Brilliant.,"Cameron, what kind of illnesses affect huMans but not rats?"
Why are you asking me that?,Because I'm sure you spent the first twelve years of your life dreaming of being a vet. The rat is not getting sick. Cameron is not getting sick.
Cameron is not getting sick. Sorry.,It's okay. It's not your fault. Presumably you're still healthy because whatEver it is is not blood borne. Steve has no excuse he did Everything that Foreman did.
Foreman tested negative for Every bacterial infection that would affect his brain.,And what infections could he be positive for but test negative for?
"Now, what if the Patient is infected, but has no antibodies what if the body is not fighting the infection? Why would","Neh, eh, I asked first. Let's start with the 'what', we'll deal with the 'why' later."
If the body doesn't recognize the infection our tests come back negative and the disease rampages through the body unstopped.,Exactly like the cop and exactly like Foreman.
"Exactly like the cop and exactly like Foreman. And what if the Patient was then exposed to a second infection, like legionella? The body would recognize that infection, increase the white count, send in the troops to start fighting, and the initial infection would get caught in the crossfire. So the question becomes, what type of bacterial infection affects huMans and not rats, and the huMan body would be unlikely to recognize.","The answer is listeria. I'm starting you on amp and gent. Transcriber's note that's ampicillin and gentamicin, two antibiotics."
So you're basing this theory on the tests being negative and your rat being healthy?,And the fact that Legionnaire's is helping you.
But the medicine you wanna give me will put an end to that.,Yeah.
And if it's not listeria all the gent will do is cure the Legionnaire's Disease and put whatEver is killing me back into overdrive.,Stop asking me questions based on the premise that I'm wrong. The antibiotics are in the airlock.
I think the first biopsy didn't give us the answer because you didn't go deep enough. I want you to do a white matter brain biopsy.,Absolutely. Don't blame you. The world is such a compliCated place if you've got higher reasoning skills. I'm often jealous of smaller animals and retarded Parkldren. Take the antibiotics.
There can be minimal damage if it's done right. If the surgeons drill where I tell them to drill.,"One slip, you could spend the rest of your life not being able to keep your drool in your mouth."
I'd rather be disabled than dead.,"Sure, I make it look oh-so-sexy. It's actually not as glamorous as you may think."
The biopsy will tell us for sure what's wrong.,The antibiotics could do the same thing!
Could! Not will.,"We try it, we see!"
The antibiotics will bring back the pain!,Pain makes us make bad decisions.
"Pain makes us make bad decisions. Fear of pain is almost as big a motivator. Now look, we still have time. I will do that biopsy if I have to, but not a moment before. Foreman takes the pills.",Start Foreman on IV antibiotics. Where's his dad?
Where are you supposed to be when your son is dying?,He's not with him.
He's in the chapel.,I've started your son on a new course of treatment.
My son says you're a Manipulative bastard.,It's a pet name. I call him Dr. Bling.
I assume you're here for a reason. What do you want from me?,When your son is in a coma you're the one who's going to have to make the medical decisions for him.
"Oh, whatEver you decide is fine.",You don't care what I do?
"No. I'll be your proxy, but we're not okay. You're scared, you're dying, but that's the only reason you wanna set things right. We're gonna get you better first, and then, if you still want to apologize, I'll be around. I'll call that Lawyer. She meets House on her way out.",Any improvements?
No. As far as we can tell the only improvements the antibiotics are treating is the legionella. I think we need to consider alternate theories.,Like what?
We do the biopsy.,Give the antibiotics more time.
There is no more time the pain was almost unbearable already!,"So he's almost in unbearable pain, he's not almost dead, which means we have more time."
Why weren't you with Foreman?,"I hang out in the basement, you rag on me. I stay in my office, you rag on me. Honky just can't buy a break."
Do the biopsy.,Based on the cop's progression I figure he's got another four hours before
You figure? You're playing Russian Roulette but the gun's pointed at him.,No. Cutting open his head is what's dangerous.
"Oh, it's dangerous. Well, what would people think? The reason you don't see Patients is because if you know them, you'll give a crap about them.",I know you
"He's out. The EEG shows he's still in pain, the antibiotics have had more than enough time, we're doing the brain biopsy.",Not unless you people can't come up with something clEver in the next three hours.
"Now, we're doing it now!","Well, who died and made you boss?"
Foreman. It's legal.,He's out of his mind! Yesterday he was giggling about a hole in a guy's head.
My son doesn't trust me how exactly is that not personal? I'm sorry.,You're sorry? You're talking about this Man's son. You're denying him the right to be a part of
"Yeah, you're a hero. If it wasn't for you, we'd be cutting into a dead guy's head instead of Foreman's. Sorry. Thanks.",That was great!
It was rude and unnecessary.,Yeah.
Yeah. Go away.,Give me time.
We're out of time.,An hour.
What does out of time mean?,His O2 stats are at 94 right now. As long as they're above 90 the danger of fatal arrhythmia doesn't increase.
So what? There's no point in waiting.,You were right. We should be cutting into a corpse's head.
"Yeah! We should be, except the CDC has got the cop's body under",There's got to be other bodies.
You think this thing has killed other people?,"No, that apartment was a dump."
"Foreman's already at 100% oxygen. Once his O2 stats hit 90, I can't wait any longer. Where's your suit?","Either you'll find the answer, or I'll find the answer. Doesn't matter."
We've gotta be ready if we get the signal. 92,Found a blind bird.
Great. How fast can you get it in here?,"I'll know in about 30 seconds. House corners the bird, but it flies off. He then finds a dripping and rusty pipe. Again, the cell rings."
"You better have the bird, the surgical team's in place.",I screwed up.
How can you not capture a blind bird?,That's not what I meant. I screwed up the first time through this place.
Foreman told you Everywhere he went.,"It's not where, it's when."
"House, I tested the water, the water's clean! As Cameron hangs up, Foreman's stats drop to 89. House climbs up a ladder and sees the water reservoir where the pigeons are drinking they have to be connected. He rings Cameron again. House.","We tested the wrong water. He stole cable, he stole fertilizer, and he stole water. looking at it under a microscope It's riddled with Naegleria."
looking at it under a microscope It's riddled with Naegleria. I know.,You already did the biopsy?
We don't know.,Up and at 'em.
"No, I mean, I don't feel any pain.",Keep your head still and follow my finger.
Keep your head still and follow my finger. I'm okay?,"Your breath stinks, you're peeing into a bag. What are our names?"
You did the biopsy? Cameron nods. Thank you.,Names.
"Cameron, my dad, and the Manipulative bastard.",You remembered.
"as House is checking Foreman's reflexes Naegleria. Biopsy showed the amoeba, CDC autopsy Eventually found the amoeba, and House found it in the water in the cop's roof.",Wiggle your left toes.
"Wait, you went back and she did the biopsy?","Your left toes, Foreman."
I just did.,"No, you didn't."
He can't move his toes?,He can move them. Raise your right arm. Foreman raises his left. Whoops.
"He's right here, Honey, he's ok, he's right here.",Tonight. L Word marathon.
You watch the L Word?,On mute.
I'll pass. House looks confused Dinner with Cuddy.,Still sucking up so she'll fund your play space for the chemo kids? They really ought to save their energy for other things. Like crying.
She's the suck up. they get into the lift,She asked you?
"She's smart. She knows if she buys me enough alcohol, my defences just might be weakened.",Doesn't make sense. Unless she ran out of batteries.
"Hey, I'm recently single, she's single.",You're too nice for her to like you she's not needy enough for you to like her.
Chase got a case in the ER he wants us to take a look.,"Unless Chase broke his neck falling off his polo pony, he had no reason to be in the ER."
Cuddy put him on a 2-week NICU rotation. Patient had an unexplained seizure.,"Seizures are cool to watch, boring to diagnose. What about Foreman? He needs to get his malingering butt back here."
Thanks. I feel great.,"Glad you're back. Cameron makes lousy coffee. Take mine black, the way I take my brain-damaged neurologists."
How are you coming along?,Tell her Everything is great. Neither of us wants to deal with her guilt.
I don't feel guilty.,"Of course not, hell if people felt guilt Every time they accidentally lobotomised a guy..."
I was trying to save his life.,"Yeah, your heart was in the right place."
"It's true. No more left-side right-side rEversals, still some short-term memory loss and spatial processing pRoblems but trying not to be too hard on myself.","Yeah, might pull a muscle."
Seizure that can't be explained by epilepsy. And accompanied by elevated calcium lEvels.,Still bored. Tell her why.
"Because seizure with mildly elevated calcium is diagnostically simple. It's either hyper parathyroid, cancer or calcium-mediated neurotoxicity. he's puzzling over how to get the paper filter into the coffee maParkne","Well done. But until you can remember how to make coffee, hands off the Patients."
"to a nurse Lungs are clear, get an EEG, confirm that brain functions are ok.",Can we focus on the task at hand? Why did mommy twitch so hard she tossed the baby in with the bathwater?
You don't need me for this.,"Of course I need you, we're a team."
"Polyarteritis nodosa. Inflamed arteries in the brain cause seizures, inflamed arteries in the kidneys cause calcium build-up.",You're a moron did you Even look at the file? Kidney functions fine.
Whipple's. she makes it sound like wibbles,What?
What? Whipple's.,Test her. she walks out Cameron thinks it starts with a w I'm thinking v.
"Dad vomited this morning, maybe they've both got strep.",Think you can do a strep throat culture without the swab ending up in the guy's poop chute?
V for vasoconstriction.,Gotta be my guess.
"Excess calcium makes blood vessels in the brain clamp down, best case scenario, seizure worst case, stroke.",Do a digital subtraction angiogram. Foreman can't tell up from down and Cameron's a girl - all that mechanical stuff.
"Sorry, Cuddy says I'm stuck here.",You're late. he's lounging on the sofa next to the door and seems to have been there for quite some time
And you are in my locked office. Again. she hides the box in the handbag,What you got there? Special panties for your date with Wilson?
It's not a date and it's none of your business.,"It's not a date, it is business. And if it was business, you wouldn't say it was none of my business."
What do you want?,I want to talk about your date with Wilson.
It's not a date.,This is fun. Spring Chase from NICU and I'll shut up about your date.
NICU is short-staffed.,Have you suddenly lost the ability to lie?
"If Chase needs a break from you, he should take it.",Absolutely.
I have no idea.,"So what causes seizures, hypercalcemia and the thing where mommy bends like Gumby?"
A little busy here.,"Oh oh, baby's lungs are going to conk out any minute. PRobably want to deal with that."
I'll get right on it as soon as I finish indulging my boss.,Multi-task.
Chemical pneumonitis. Bubble bath got into the baby's lungs when he was underwater. Start him on prednisone keep him on high FIO2 to a nurse.,Let the indulging commence.
And tox screen was negative.,"Lithium doesn't show on a basic tox screen, scarecrow."
Myelogenous meningitis could also cover Everything.,Rare complications of a rare blood cancer.
"I'm not putting that baby on ECMO, the chance of there being bacteria in bathwater--","Why don't you want to work for me? I'm nice, I'm fun at parties."
I'm not working NICU because of you. The baby's x-ray suggests a chemical pneumonitis.,Not to me. X-ray was too consolidated. So why are you down here? Hoping to expand your make out pool to include the preme to nine-year-old demographic?
"I needed a break. From the Patients. They lie to us all the time, Foreman almost died trying to save a drug-dealing cop. I just wanted to get away from that for a while.",What a complete load of crap. What am I a nurse you're trying to prep with this vulnerability thing?
ECMO could kill him.,You don't start him on ECMO and that infection could rampage through his body like pistons fans after a championship.
Absolutely. Cuddy's trash?,Not anymore. Paid good money for it. he finally finds the empty box that Cuddy was trying to hide that morning Look at what she bought.
he finally finds the empty box that Cuddy was trying to hide that morning Look at what she bought. Red clover.,"What is red clover used for, Dr Wilson?"
"Also used to treat asthma, psoriasis, joint pain...","She doesn't wheeze, flake or ache. And she didn't ask a pulmonologist or a dermatologist for dinner. She invited an oncologist. It's not a date, it's a consult."
"Mom's MRI was negative for masses, abscesses, there's no sign that she has myelogenous meningitis--","Fascinating, call me when we have--"
She has a subarachnoid bleed.,So why is our Patient bleeding into her brain?
Her blood workup shows her ProTime's elevated.,"She's bleeding because she's not clotting. So why is she not clotting? Foreman is in the room What'd you bring us, daddy?"
"Hiding booze is classic alcoholic behaviour, that'd explain the bleeding. What bleeding?",You don't remember?
But tox screen was negative for alcohol.,"Hey, it was your idea. Now it's Even better. Mommy quits, she gets the DTs, it Even explains the seizure."
"Also fits conversion disorder. They're deep in Debt, he's working round the clock, they got a new baby - I think the seizure was a physical response to psychological stress.",Boozing mommy covers more symptoms. Put her in a nice Phenobarbital coma before the DTs kill her.
Boozing mommy covers more symptoms. Put her in a nice Phenobarbital coma before the DTs kill her.,Where are you going?
To put her in a phenocoma.,What if I'm wrong? What if daddy's the drunk?
Do you want us to give her the pheno or not?,I want him to argue his point!
I assume you considered the father and ruled him out.,What's that saying where you ASSume you become a pain in the ass to me?
Why should I argue? You'd just overrule me.,Enough! Get a pony or a watermelon farm!
Get a pony or a watermelon farm! House!,"I need him to react I need him to act like a huMan being. I need him to get over this boring, near-death rebirth."
I have changed. It's not something you get over.,"Nearly dying changes Everything forEver. For about 2 months. 2 months is too long, I need the guy I hired back now."
"No matter how much your misery loves company, it's not getting mine. I'll talk to the dad, Cameron can take the mom, we'll figure out if mom was a drinker.",Waste of time put her in a coma before the DTs kill her.
"Turns out she and her husband met in AA, obviously she slipped. Good call.",It wasn't hard considering my other choice was your stupid psych theory.
pats House on the back You're addicted to conflict.,Did they change the name?
"You could have handled this Patient without dragging Chase in but the fact that he didn't want in killed you. House looks into Kara's room, she's on her side facing away from the glass wall doing something Just like the fact that you can't get a rise out of me.",notices the empty baby crib at the end of Kara's bed Where's the baby?
"notices the empty baby crib at the end of Kara's bed Where's the baby? he throws his cane away and quickly runs as well as a crippled Man can at any rate into Kara's room, Foreman hot on his heels","No breath sounds, crash cart and epi, stat! he starts giving the baby mouth-to-mouth I told you your psych theory wasn't stupid."
She just happened to seize right in the middle of drowning her Parkld? Lucky break for the kid.,"Hey, take it easy on Foreman. He's playing with one lobe tied behind his back."
"Postpartum psychosis makes her want to drown her kid, the internal conflict triggers a seizure.",You know what else might be a trigger?
"I'll draw some blood, test for--",Ahhhh!!
We already tested for--,Exactly! It's an insane idea!
Ok. What do you want me to do?,"Have an original thought. In the meantime, stress her into having another seizure."
"We can't, she's on Haloperidol.","You also can't because it's dangerous and highly unethical, therefore, if you get caught, pretend you can't make coffee, mental defectives get tons of slack."
Stop pushing him.,Stop protecting him.
He needs it.,Not if he wants to get better.
He might not be able to get better.,Well then I need a new neurologist.
He got sick doing his job.,Well if he got killed doing his job I wouldn't keep him on the payroll.
I'm not touched.,Then you're guilt-ridden.
I'm not guilt-ridden!,Then you're pathetic!
"Right now I'm annoyed! Keeping him up all night in a seizure lab is not the way to advance his recovery, it's too much!","You're right, should stick around, make sure he doesn't screw up."
"Oh, give it a rest.",How was dinner?
Cuddy did not mention cancer.,She lost her nerve.
It was a date.,What are you doing?
What are you doing? PCR test.,"You're doing it yourself, in the middle of the night? On a spoon. Cuddy's spoon?"
I'm checking her saliva for cancer markers.,Yeah. I do that after all my dates too. People think you're the nice one.
Why are you so worried about Cuddy?,You go first. You desperately want this to be a date.
Because the alternative is cancer.,"Just admit that you like her. She's smart, funny, got a zesty bod. I think it's great you can look beyond the fact she's the devil."
"I stole her spoon, you stole her garbage.","She's my boss. She gets sick, the hospital might replace her, especially if she dies. I'd have to learn how to Manipulate someone new."
Woah. I think I'm going to cry.,Find me when the results come in.
"Muscle rigidity, involuntary grasping and sucking motions, she's in an encephalopathic delirium.",Hmm... a genuine physiological illness that rules out a few things. Like what I wonder?
Postpartum psychosis and conversion disorder.,"Thing about being a good loser, you're still a loser."
"The delirium means her brain is shutting down, rEverting to its most instinctual functions.","Since it's progressing, we can assume it's progressive. Which means it won't be long before the brain closes shop altogether. Ideas?"
hands the paddles back to her Another amp of epi!,Chase shouldn't be wasting his time in the NICU.
Could be Wernicke's.,"No, treatment for Wernicke's is thiamine we gave her that together with the vino."
"Delirium points to lithium, I know we didn't find any but--",She had to be smuggling it in to be getting sicker.
The test could have been wrong.,"Ideas are not soda cans, recycling sucks. Give me something new and shiny. Or go retro, take an old idea, shine it up, add a new symptom... encephalopathic delirium. Pellagra."
She drinks. Alcoholics get pellagra. They eat lousy diets so no niacin.,"He agrees with me, what a shock."
Pellagra doesn't cause bloody vomit. She's still sick and getting worse.,So...
I should have given him more polystyrene.,"You killed him, if you don't get over it, you're going to kill momma too."
"You remove the drinking from the equation, internal bleeding, hypercalcemia, seizure and pellagra are all back in.","looks at Chase who is still despondent Chase, would you get your head out of the dead baby's butt and focus on the barely alive-- he suddenly realises something How"
One gram. His potassium just kept rising.,I need your son.
Who are you?,Your wife's doctor. Your son may have had the same condition she does.
"My son didn't have a condition, she killed him.","If I biopsy her intestines, she'll bleed out. He obviously won't."
You're not using my son's body to help her.,Ok.
So I drink. You're acting like this is my fault.,People are going to feel sorry for you they'll tell you that you can't anticipate the unthinkable well the fact is you can. It's just not all that pleasant.
"Look, you don't know anything about how--",I know that people don't get crazy enough to kill someone without first being crazy enough for someone to notice.
What is wrong with you? What kind of a person says those things now?,Let me do the test. It'll be one less thing for you to feel crappy about.
Let me do the test. It'll be one less thing for you to feel crappy about.,Got a dead baby for you to autopsy.
Let Cameron do it.,Love working NICU? I can get you transferred.
"I told you, I just wanted to trust Patients.",You don't give a crap about Patients.
he tries to grab it from House but House pulls it out of his reach I'm not rich.,But your dad was now he's dead. If you're not rich that means that daddy cut you out. he gives Chase the envelope
I'm not rich.,Don't let it change you. And do the test.
How would a baby have flattened villi?,He was being treated with polystyrene.
He was being treated with polystyrene. Polystyrene shouldn't--,It didn't. Question is what do they use in the NICU to bind it together?
Question is what do they use in the NICU to bind it together? Wheat gluten.,It's great stuff. Unless your body can't tolerate it.
The baby didn't have colic he had celiac disease?,Just like mom.
"No, celiac causes nutritional deprivation. Our Patient has excess calcium.",to Wilson Tell them what causes excess calcium. With a Chaser of bloody vomit.
Celiac Patients are susceptible to cancer of the stomach lining. She has MALT lymphoma.,"Well, she's your Patient now. he looks back at the sheet Wilson gave him with the results of Cuddy's PCR test And it wasn't a date."
"Well, she's your Patient now. he looks back at the sheet Wilson gave him with the results of Cuddy's PCR test And it wasn't a date.",You don't have cancer.
You don't have dwarfism.,"You have no proof of that. I on the other hand, have this. he hands her the results sheet"
You ran a PCR on me without my consent?,"Hey, it's good news."
Really? It's just hard to access because of this overwhelming sense of personal violation.,"Deal with it on your own time. Bad news, oestrogen is too high."
"No matter how Many people you tell otherwise, I am and always have been a Woman. Oestrogen is normal.","Not this much, not for at least for another week. That's when you ovulate."
You monitor my periods? Based on when I get bitchy or...?,"Once a month, when you leave the kids cancer ward, your eyes glisten."
"I was considering a donation, not a party.",So... when's our dinner? with accompanying hand gestures
So... when's our dinner? with accompanying hand gestures,Oh he's going to be so disappointed.
I killed my son.,"Is it my turn to say something obvious now? Oh I know, you were insane."
I did it. I chose to do it.,"Yeah, like diabetics choose to not produce insulin. Listen, someone got sick, someone died. Happens Every day. The only difference in this case is it wasn't the same someone."
I could have stopped. I didn't have to listen to those voices.,Spoken like a true sane person. This is not your fault. You're healthy now... except for the cancer.
Those voices felt as real to me as Michael's hand. Right here when he nursed. And... the smell of his hair...,You do not deserve to die.
Maybe. I don't want to live.,She said no.
"So we get her declared unstable, appoint a medical proxy.","She was unstable, now she's sane. She's entitled to refuse treatment."
"We have to change her mind, you can't just walk away.","Fine, go on in there and tell her that Every day is a blessing!"
Why are you doing this to me? I was happy!,You were aspiring to be content.
Don't give me a seMantic argument. I was content with the way things were! That's what happiness is!,"Yeah, if we're all just satisfied with what we have, what a beautiful world it would be."
I can live with that.,No you can't. Not anymore.
If you got treatment then maybe we could... long silent pause When you see Mikey... tell him his dad says he's sorry.,Hi.
Hi. Bye.,Bye.
Did you tell Cuddy that we tested her for cancer?,Yeah.
Yeah. And?,"It wasn't a date. Wilson narrows his eyes Turned out she had some skin lesions, guess there was no genetic predisposition. Wilson looks a little suspicious but lets it pass"
"Her heart looks fine. ER did a full cardiac workup. Tox screen's clean, blood work shows no infection",All on the top page. I'm a real good reader. Personal chart handoff means there's something else. I'm hoping it's not personal.
"The guy who brought the girl in says he knows you. I thought I'd met all your friend. I was also wondering if you could take a look at these, when you have a chance. gives him an envelope No hurry, it's just a couple of medical histories, one with a minor cancer concern",No pRoblem.
"G-Man! He runs toward House as though he's going to hug him, but stops. You thought I was going to do it, didn't you?",Do I know you?
"Come on, it's me, Crandall!",Doesn't ring a bell.
"Man, I can't beliEve you didn't","Unless you mean Dylan Crandall, the Man who'll beliEve anything. See, I just made you beliEve that I!."
You haven't changed. Heard about your leg.,"Yeah, pulled a hamstring playing Twister. Just gonna walk it off. So, who's the girl?"
Jesse Baker's granddaughter. You always said you'd give your right hand to play like him.,"No, I said I'd give my right hand to have his left. Why is she with you?"
"She lost her mom in Katrina, her home, Everything.",Wow.
And I'm her father.,Hmmm! yeah. She looks just like you. Best to point out now that Crandall is white and Leona is black. Got the same 'fro.
"I wrote a book about Baker, hung out with him his daughter.","Yeah, that's how babies are made."
"I nEver knew, she nEver knew. Her mom lied for sixteen years.",That's unbelievable.
That's unbelievable. Yeah.,"Seriously, I don't beliEve it."
"Her mom was pissed at me about my book I trashed her and her dad. She wouldn't talk to me obviously, she's not going to tell Leona that",You're a sucker. You always were.
Does that mean you're not going to help her?,Why wouldn't I? She's not scamming me.
Acute myocardial infarction?,ER said no. Retest.
Retest. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome?,"ER said no. Retest, and read the damn file."
Delta wave on the EKG looks like,It's all a 'no.' Everything about her heart is healthy.
She's a Katrina victim!,It's better than Crandall. He's a Katrina victim victim.
"I don't think she was expecting your sympathy. I think her point was New Orleans was a third-world country toxins, mold, sewage in the streets!","What if her heart is like my bike? Runs like crap when I'm by myself, but take it to the mechanic and it runs great?"
"What are we going to do, keep her in a room on a cardiac monitor until she has another arrhythmia? That could be weeks, months! While she says this, we see House clutParkng his leg.","Relax, I happen to know she's going to have one right after lunch. We are golden."
You can't induce an arrhythmia in someone whose heart gave out nearly 48 hours ago.,"Sure you can, but it's kinda technical you stick all these cool little wires inside her somehow, and"
I mean you shouldn't.,"Oh, right, because it would be much more ethical to let it happen in an uncontrolled setting."
I'll go talk to him.,"Oh, that's an excellent plan! You'll give him the form and tell him it's wrong and dangerous."
I can handle a simple consent form.,"Okay, I'll be Crandall. Dr. Cameron"
"House, from what you say, this guy will trust us",Are you in this scene? Go.
I'd like to talk to you about a procedure we'd like to do on Leona.,Like to do? Is this fun for you?
He's not you! He's not going to mock me.,Stay in character! I'm so scared. Hold me.
"In order to figure out which circuit is misfiring, we need to map all the electrical activity in her heart.",Swear to me on the Bible you'd do this if it was your kid. Good-bye.
Swear to me on the Bible you'd do this if it was your kid. Good-bye.,"It's a map of the electrical pathways of the heart. We send electricity to each, one at a time, until one fails."
It sounds dangerous.,It's a risk I am prepared to take.
"If she's got an electrical pRoblem, couldn't more electricity blow her whole system?","Well, who's been watParkng Bill Nye the Science Guy? The test is perfectly safe. We do it Every day. as Crandall prepares to sign And you beliEve me."
I shouldn't do the test?,It's crazy dangerous. Just sign the damn form. hands Crandall a tissue
"I'm not crying, I can handle this.",Blow your nose. I need DNA from somewhere.
You're not running a paternity test.,"She's going to stay around just long enough to get your bank account, your credit card numbers and then she's going to be off with her next daddy."
What she's been through! why would you assume,Because of what she's been through.
"Because that's your default position, always has been!","Because she's still alive! Raised by a junkie, living off the streets, that tends to kick the sweetness out of you."
Figured you'd have mellowed.,That's because you're an idiot.
"If I let you do the test, it means I don't trust her.","No, it means I don't trust her."
Sinoatrial node is normal,"Next! Leona fidgets, and the monitors beep."
Stop the current.,Is she hallucinating?
She's crashing. BP's plummeting.,"Foreman, is she hallucinating?"
"No, normal waves.",Then the AV node is not the bad pathway. All that was was a heart attack. Reset her so we can find the real pRoblem.
They shock her. Normal rhythm.,"Chase, high right atrium, please."
Her heart's fragile after that last attack. The chances of tachycardia,You have my permission to blame Foreman at any negligence trial.
It's near the coronary sinus.,"Freeze it. Chase presses a button, and CG graphics show the catheter freezing the damaged heart muscle."
EEG's back to normal. No hallucinations.,She'll be fine by breakfast.
She'll be fine by breakfast.,Interesting reading.
Those are my top two choices for sperm donors. I wanted your medical opinion on genetics.,They're losers.

Why are you so bent on her not having a hallucination?,"If she did have a hallucination, then the heart pRoblem that we predicted, found, and fixed was just a gigantic coincidence. He leaves again."
It's getting worse.,yelling through the wall What if the heart isn't a coincidence and isn't what caused the hallucination?
"She has an autoimmune disease. She needs a CRP, a rheumatoid factor, a",I can prove an autoimmune disease in five minutes. She needs a PET scan.
You can't test for autoimmune in a PET scan,"I'm proving that her hallucinations are a consistent response to pain, which proves that she has an autoimmune disease."
How do you test someone's response to pain?,Easy. Hurt them.
Easy. Hurt them.,It's not going to hurt at all. We just need to make sure you don't move.
We just need to make sure you don't move. I won't.,"Okay, give me your arm. Let's check your muscle responses. Okay, turn it over, arm upward. Everything okay?"
"Diagnostic test. Cerebral cortex responding normally, she's not hallucinating.","You know he's not your father, don't you?"
He's my dad. Mama told me.,I'm sorry I didn't mean to hurt you. He sticks her again in the leg.
"House, leave her alone!","Come on, we both know it's a hustle. Are the walls closing in?"
"No, why are you doing this?",Spiders coming out of my nose?
"House, the test is over. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is fine.",Give me your hand.
Give me your hand. No!,Give me your hand!
"She's lost Everything, and you're breaking fingers. A new low.","Diagnostically, she needed to be hurt."
"We don't Even know what autoimmune disease she has. Could be LAmbert-Eaton, could be something.",Good point. Let's kill them all at once.
The only way to do that is to replace her entire immune system.,Good point. Let's do that.
Bone marrow transplant requires an exact match. Leona has no siblings.,"Good point. She's all alone, poor thing, no one in the whole, wide world."
"If my daughter needs bone marrow, why are you looking at a bone marrow registry?",Because that's where they keep the bone marrow.

Just my marrow I'm not authorizing a paternity test.,You're not afraid of the truth?
I know the truth!,"Easy lay feigns truth, and says she needs a bus ticket home to visit her sick grandma."
If our friendship means anything to you,"Come on, do you know me at all?"
You didn't tell me about the spiders!,Did you get a new couch?
Do you think there might be some sort of toxin?,What color is it?
What color is it? Red.,Is that where you watch your cartoons after you take your bath?
"Mm hmm! He wipes the kid's chest with a wet washcloth, which turns red.",Fall asleep sometimes?
Fall asleep sometimes? sneezes Yes.,Bless you. Cuddy enters.
Need you. Now.,"Yes, mistress. I'll write you a prescription for one of these. Just wet and apply."
You didn't tell anyone else what I'm doing?,Not a soul.
"Wilson? Cameron, maybe you mentioned it to her?","No, I'm a really good secret keeper. I nEver told anyone that Wilson wets his bed."
Part of the protocol for in vitro fertilization is twice-daily injections of menotropins. I can't do it myself.,Turn around.

MicRobes can be sneaky. Ow! Thanks.,Twice a day. This is going to be fun.
I got it. Radiation tech leaves. So why were you friends with this guy?,"We were 20 years old, he had a car. If he had been a Woman, I would have married him."
Is he a match?,No. Lying girl lucked out and found one in the registry.
Is he the dad?,I don't think so.
You didn't run the test?,Said I wouldn't.
"Okay, so either you lied or he has pictures of you! being nice?",Stop the radiation. House rushes in to find black sludge trickling out of Leona's mouth.
What the hell is that?,I have no idea.
Lab results from the black ooze. You're not going to beliEve it.,She pooped out of her mouth.
"The sample contained stool and digested blood, how did you guess?","'Cause it oozed if it was in her stomach it would have sprayed, if it was in her lungs she would have coughed."
Liver failure. There'd be no proteins to clot the blood so it would clot the blood and mess up her intestines.,"Means oops, we were wrong, because no autoimmune disease shuts down an organ in two hours. We need to do a liver biopsy, find out what the real pRoblem is."
"Means oops, we were wrong, because no autoimmune disease shuts down an organ in two hours. We need to do a liver biopsy, find out what the real pRoblem is.","Hey, need to talk to you."

"You telling me I shouldn't care? Prep me to handle it, in case she dies?","It's brown, it's lumpy! I'm going to heave all over my desk."

"Here's my theory you're jealous. He's maturing, he's accepting responsibility, you're emotionally stuck at sEventeen.","He's Manufacturing responsibility, he's not maturing. He hasn't changed at all."
"So then, why do you care?",That black ooze we saw? That was a bowel movement. Out of her mouth.
You're trying to end this conversation by grossing me out? I'm an oncologist. Half of my Patients have their skin sloughing off. Why are you so worried about this guy?,He was having a rough time with his girlfriend.
"So, you gave him advice and she dumped him.","No, I told him that I would talk to her."
And you blew it?,Technically!
It's House. He says stop.,Check it out.
Please tell me you didn't have us stop the biopsy to check out some tunes!,"His left hand is very subtle, very deliCate."
This girl is dying.,Be dying a lot faster if I let you do that obviously unnecessary biopsy. Now listen.
"My God! Grandpa was an angry drunk, if only we'd known!",Here's how to become a great artist.
You're saying he didn't do drugs?,Not when he played this. Something was screwing with his personality.
"Yeah, drugs and alcohol don't do that.","And that note that he says is out of tune, it's not, which means that something is screwing with his aural perception, too."
Unless you can tell me Miles Davis couldn't play stoned,"Played better when he wasn't. I think, I mean, no one knows for sure."
I'll get Leona a TIBC and serum ferritin.,We can test this in three minutes.
We can test this in three minutes.,"So, what is she, Foreman? Light-skinned black Parkck or dark-skinned white Parkck?"
It's too early to see jaundice from the liver.,True. This is a photograph of Leona when she was 13 years old. She's darker now.
She's been living on the streets for eight months.,"No tan line, so unless those streets she's been living on are indoor streets, I'm thinking she's got iron deposits in her melanin, both byproducts of hemochromatosis, just like Granddad used to make."
"I'm not going to get this job, am I?",It's a done deal. I knew it the moment I saw you. Interview's just a formality.
"House, what are you","Cuddy, this is Patrick Glidahan. Patrick's going to be the new intern rotating in my department."
Sorry. I laugh when I'm nervous.,"Bet you've been doing that your whole life, huh?"
"Cancer, infectious disease, the big devils. I think that medicine has become too institutionalized. We need to send a message to our Patients that we're just like them. I mean, we're all people.","We're all people. I like that. She's all hard science, facts. I like to know a person's hopes and dreams. What kind of music do you like, Patrick?"

It's a chelating agent.,What does the chelating do?
Removes excess iron from the liver.,How?
"Iron is heavy, it gets stuck. Deferoxamine is like a lubricant. It makes the iron slick so it can move around again.",Moves around where?
It's supposed to be discharged through waste.,"Her waste system is a little screwy right now, means the waste can't go where it wants to go. What if it went to the lungs?"
"WhatEver's in the lungs likes iron, bound with it, started poking holes.",What likes iron?
Fungus likes iron.,No objections to that one?
"If a fungus is doing all this, she's dead. There are 25 anti-fungals, if we don't know which","When in doubt, go broad."
Most common is Aspergillus.,"Continue to ventilate her lungs, get her on a voriconazole drip, hope she has Aspergillus."
The process is confidential. You violated his privacy! How did you Even,"I looked up 'loser' in the cryo bank. You wouldn't look within a hundred miles of that idiot, and yet you're willing to have his baby."

Crandall says she was living in the Parkldren's shelter in Ridgeland.,"Okay, the one thing we know for sure is she was not living in the Parkldren's shelter in Ridgeland."
Why would he lie about that?,"He wouldn't, if he beliEved her story about the sweet little girl trying to do the right thing."
"We can't ask Leona where she was, she's intubated.","Don't try to talk, you've got a big medical thing in your mouth."
"Don't try to talk, you've got a big medical thing in your mouth. Just blink if you understand. Blink. Fantastic. Blink if you lied to Crandall about Everything. You picked up a fungus somewhere. If you were living in the shelter like you told your new daddy I got nothing to go on, and you will die. So, did you lie to Crandall? You're a lousy con artist. First rule of the game is know your mark. Once you got Crandall to bite on the poppet thing you had him. You could have told him that you were servicing Al Qaeda's suicide bombers for crack, this guy would still let you pick out the colors in your new room. Did you lie to Crandall? Blink. House puts a pen and paper in her hands. Where were you?","And the winner is! oh, you read it, I just get so nervous at these things."
"oh, you read it, I just get so nervous at these things. Recording studio.","She read the book. She knew how much Crandall hated that place, what went on there. She overplayed her hand."
"Recording studio doesn't help us, medically.",Recording studios. Why are these buildings different from all other buildings?
"Soundproofing. Absorbs sound, also absorbs moisture.","Where there's moisture, a lot of it, let's say, Katrina moist, there's"

Thank you for the injections.,You're welcome. You came all the way up here just to tell me that?
No. She leaves.,Pretty much normal. Liver function tests are good.
"Liver function tests are good. Thanks, G-Man.",What makes you think you'd be a good father?
I don't know. Feels right. It feels good.,"Well, at least you've got a good reason."
It feels good is a good enough reason. Leona begins to choke. What's happening?,"She's choking, she can't breathe."
This episode was not big on giving names of secondary characters. All names used were found on the official Fox.com summary.,He's got a temperature of 103.
And why do we care?,Because we're huMan beings. It's what we do. Said he was at a luncheon meeting.
You took his history?!,Guy looks like Harpo. You should see him.
You asked him what book he's currently reading.,It's hilarious to watch him try and talk. I asked him anything I could think of. Favorite color? Bwuu.

You're an ass.,I know. Where're you going?
Which one of you is House?,Skinny brunette.
"No, that's Dr. Cameron.",I'm skinny. How do you know her name?
I was a Patient of yours.,"Oh, well, if you want to leave the chocolates downstairs Jack pulls out a gun and shoots House in the side."
"Stay! Stay away from him. Shocking, isn't it? Who'd want to hurt you? Another shot is heard as the opening scene ends.","You're pathetic. Cameron puts down her book. Judging by the growth, I'd say I've been unconscious for two days. You've been sitting there the whole time."
You've been sitting there the whole time. No.,"Judging by the oily buildup in your hair, I'd say you're lying."
I was scared. Pardon me for caring.,Did I lose any organs?
"The bullet to your abdomen pierced your stomach, nicked the bowel, and lodged in the posterior rib. She pours him some water.","Well, I always say, if you're going to get shot, do it in a hospital."
The one in your neck,I don't remember that one.
"-- went right through, sEvered your jugular. The shooter turns out to be a guy who",Don't care.
You don't care why a guy walked into a hospital and shot a doctor? Shot you?,I assume his reasoning was faulty. So what was it? Infection?
The surgery went fine. You've had no post-op,Not me. Patient. Harpo.
"You just got shot, House. You should rest.","I got shot. Diagnostically boring. Big fat tongue, on the other hand, endlessly entertaining."
We biopsied his tongue. Shot of said biopsy.,And it was negative. And the blood tests were negative.
I didn't say we did blood tests.,You don't biopsy a tongue unless you have to biopsy a tongue and you don't have to biopsy a tongue unless you've already come up with nothing on a routine battery of tests which don't involve torturing the Patient.
"You knew the next step would be a lumbar puncture. A lumbar puncture would almost certainly give us a definitive answer. Since we don't have a definitive answer, we must not have done an LP, and the most common reason not to do an LP is increased intracranial pressure. While Cameron is speaking, someone is wheeled into the spot next to House's bed because in a hospital where Every Patient gets their own room, House certainly can't!. The Patient is Jack. He was shot by Security trying to House. House takes off the wires attaParkng him to the monitor. Will you House!",I'm talking to Cuddy.
"Lie down, you've got to be in pain!","as he's walking out with his IV Not today, today I'm on morphine."
following him out You're gonna rip your stitches out.,Check Harpo's trash.
Forget about the Patient!,"Come on, you're curious. Trash. You don't know what I'm talking about, but you know it's good."
You can't just be walking around.,"Well, then, stop me."
You've lost blood,"Physically, stop me."
You could damage,"You can't, because that would involve touParkng me and then things would get so sexually charged Cameron physically stops him."
"Everything that lives, eats Everything that eats, poops that's why Every organ has a sanitation department, a lymph system. WhatEver's doing the damage is dumping its waste in there. That's what you meant by trash.",Biopsy the lymph node under the jaw.
"Sorry, I know it's crazy, but there's no other place. The ICU stands for intensive care, he needs intensive care, so do you.",He needs to be shot again.
"He is handcuffed to his bed, he is sedated, he is not gonna hurt you.",If your security was any good I wouldn't have been shot in the first place. He fiddles with the morphine drip.
He is where he's supposed to be. Where you're supposed to be.,Who did my surgery?
"Gillick. Why, you're going to send him a fruit basket?",He screwed up.
It's annoying enough dealing with your Vicodin habit. Quit upping your morphine.,I'm not. I'm reducing it.
And you're not in pain?,I'm feeling better.
Gillick is very good. Your recovery time,"My stomach kills me, my neck is thRobbing, my leg feels better."
"My stomach kills me, my neck is thRobbing, my leg feels better. That's amazing.","It's unbelievable. Since getting shot is not an FDA-approved treatment for anything, it means something must have gone wrong in the surgery."
"Yes. Terribly, tragically wrong. Enjoy the mistake.","He must have nicked something in my peripheral nervous system. If it's alleviating pain, who knows what else it's doing."
Get back to the ICU before you rip out your stitches and I have to chain you to your bed.,Why did you try to kill me?
Why did you try to kill me? I didn't.,Then the gun thing might have been a mistake.
Are you sure you want to be doing this?,"I'm fine, I think. Cameron, you got my records?"
They don't like to release Patients' operative notes.,And yet you're holding them. And whispering.
And whispering. He's sleeping.,Yeah. Killer needs his rest. Otherwise he's grumpy all day. House bangs on Jack's bed with his cane. Hey! Wake up! Watch me save a life!
"Almost for sure it's some sort of infection. We've got him on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but it's not Even slowing the thing down. Unless we find out what type of infection, we can't treat, and we can't figure out what type because we can't do an LP.",Do an LP. to Jack See what I did there? Couldn't have done that if you killed me.
We would have done an LP two days ago if the risks hadn't so obviously outweighed the benefits. We just cut a hole in his throat. The equation has changed.,"Couldn't have put it better myself. They leave, and House is left to his notes."
You wanna hear a story?,I have a rule. People who shoot me forfeit the right to
My wife was sick. None of the doctors could figure out why.,"Oh, I know this story. She died, so you selected one of her doctors to kill because that would make Everything right again."
"No, she lived. You cured her.",I'm truly sorry I did that.
"In the course of investigating her illness, you convinced me that Everything was relevant. You needed the truth. I confessed to you that I had had an affair. But it turns out it had nothing to do with why she was sick. Genetic predisposition to brain aneurysms. You told her that. You also told her about my affair.",You caught crap. She left you. Now I've gotta pay because you couldn't keep your little Killer in you pants.
She killed herself. A long pause.,What sort of hospital has glass walls?
It's my husband.,Really?
You thought I just liked watParkng people get needles poked in their back?,"No, I just figured a co-worker or sister, not wife."
"No, I just figured a co-worker or sister, not wife. Why?","Don't worry, it's not insulting. At least, not to you. You're satisfied with that answer?"
"You're Dr. House, aren't you?","You're not going to shoot me, are you?"
"You treated a friend of mine. She told me you only talk to people if you have to, and then you insult them while showing off how insightful you are.","SEvens marry sEvens, nines marry nines, fours marry fours."
So you figure my marriage is a mathematical error.,Numbers don't lie. We're having trouble finding out what infection your husband has. The most likely culprit is an STD.
You want to know if I've had an affair with someone closer to my integer and I have to tell you the truth or my husband will die.,Is your friend single?
What's going on? What are they doing?,"I should go. His hand is bloody, and there is blood on his Robe. I seem to have torn my stitches. He collapses on the floor."
You collapsed in the hall. Tore your stitches.,I remember. I was there.
How's your gut? It's hurting?,You shoot the guy who sold her the gun?
She locked herself in the garage and she started the car.,You shoot the guy who sold her the garage door opener? Jack smirks. You're an ass.
Now that is a bold position to take given that I shot you.,The shooting just makes you an idiot. You're an ass because you're trying to wrap it in a flag like you did a good thing.
"You're an ass and a hypocrite. You don't beliEve in rules, you do whatEver you think is right! it's all I did. You were my role model.","Watch out, you're getting crumbs on the flag. I didn't commit to honor her, I didn't commit to nEver lie to her."

"It's my fault she's dead! I know it. But why can't you admit it's maybe just a little bit yours, too? That maybe it's not just medical mistakes that screw things up?","Here's how life works. You either get to ask for an apology, or you get to shoot people. Not both."
"Here's how life works. You either get to ask for an apology, or you get to shoot people. Not both.",Infections don't make your eyes pop out.
We should get back. You're supposed to be chained to your bed.,Not done eating. Got to be some sort of bleeding disorder.
This is really stupid.,"Look, my stitches pop out again, I got three doctors to save me."
You think the surgeon would have noticed a giant growth while sticking the eyeball back in.,"Tongue and eyes are sick. What about the nose? It's right in between, why isn't it sick?"
"So it's not spreading, it's got a common source.",Which can only be what?
"The brain, except the CT was clean.","Check the brain's trash, see what it's hiding."
The brain doesn't have a lymph system.,"I know, all its garbage just gets caught in the snow fence by the side of the road."
You're referring to the blood-brain barrier.,What else? Biopsy the barrier.
Wouldn't it be safer to make a few eduCated guesses first? Try some relatively safe treatments?,"Biopsy the barrier, first start him on mebendazole in case it's a worm."
And azithromycin for STDs.,I really don't think the wife is the kind to be messing around. If I was married to her I certainly wouldn't
"Really, it's more helpful if you do the prescribed rehab yourself.","My body is fine. He's looking over the operation notes again. My mind, on the other hand"
Maybe she was a girlfriend. Maybe she was just trying to jerk you around.,"Spoke to Every nurse on that floor, the Patient only had six visitors. Two females, no babes. His mother and his aunt."
So they missed someone. They're not Security.,My posse nEver saw her or me talking on the other side of the glass.
They were a little busy trying to save the guy's life.,"There's only one possible conclusion. It was a hallucination. What does that look like to you, a .6? He holds the chart up to Wilson."
"Anesthesia? No, it's gotta be 6 smudge. Let's say you're right. It wouldn't be that uncommon after trauma, after that much blood loss.",My perceptions are compromised and my judgment is compromised. What if his wife told me that the Patient just got bit by a rabid Vietnamese leopard?
So pull yourself off the case.,And the next case?
You take two weeks. You recover.,And what if I don't? What if it wasn't the shooting?
The guy who sees connections between Everything sees no connection between being shot and minor brain disruption?,What if it was the surgery?
What if it was the fact that you tore out your stitches and lost two pints of blood?,Why did Gillick give me ketamine during my surgery?
Why did Gillick give me ketamine during my surgery? Working.,We need to talk.
Get back to the ICU. Who uncuffed you?,Why would a surgeon administer ketamine?
Who showed you your surgical file?,How do you know it's mine?
Because your Patient hasn't had surgery and you don't care about anyone else.,"My anesthesia was almost non-existent, and yet I wasn't awake. For some reason, someone decided to put me in a dissociative coma instead of just putting me out."
There are plenty of reasons to use,"Fine, I'll go beat the truth out of my surgeon."
"It worked! House turns. There's a clinic in GerMany, they've been treating chronic pain by inducing comas and letting the mind basically reboot itself. There's about a fifty percent chance your pain will come back, which, of course, means there's a fifty percent chance that it won't.",You had no right!
To heal you?!,You messed with my brain!
"Why are you so upset? Are you experiencing any neurological symptoms? Dizziness, tremors, hallucinations?",No. It's a point of principle.
No trash against the fence. Is your leg really better?,"Don't worry, I'm sure something else is wrong."
We did find blood.,On which side?
The wrong side.,The first thing that makes sense.
"It could mess with his brain, it wouldn't cause fEver. looking at Jack He's been sleeping a lot lately.","You worried? I marked a change of meds on his chart. and back to Vince Foreign object, body wants to get rid of it, causes the fEver."
"In the brain lining, it is. Blood dyscrasia means cancer.",Find it.
All the tests,Have been negative.
We'll check the lymphatic system in the chest.,You got that from trash cans in the alley?
The saliva glands in the tongue are connected to the lymphatic system in the lungs. It's the next lymphatic system over.,Yeah. Go get lung lymph. The team leaves.
How did he know that?,I wouldn't have hired him if he wasn't smart.
"House, we need to talk to you.",How the hell did you know I was awake?
Your nostrils flare when you sleep.,No they do not.
"Fine, I'm lying.",Test was negative.
Test was negative. You knew?,Force of habit.
Surgeons found no evidence of a burst artery.,The blood had to come from somewhere. You took a shower in it.
You took a shower in it. Trauma?,You think someone snuck in here just to kick him in the jewels and poke out his eye and swell up his tongue?
"Kidneys drain into the bladder which drains into the ureter, there's no way it would mess with the scrotum.","Yeah, basic huMan anatomy."
Maybe he's not huMan.,"An anatomical defect would seem more likely, but let's not rule that one out."
"You may have been lucky. You don't catch testicular cancer early, it kills. PRobably eroded some vessel","Yeah, yeah, I know. Question is why I didn't think of it."
Eyes popping out is a rather odd presentation.,"Sac blowing up, on the other hand!"
If you could think of Everything yourself you wouldn't need a team to annoy.,I screwed up some basic anatomy and I'm misconnecting a testicular explosion with a testicular pRoblem.
She was trying to help you and it worked.,"Yeah, I can run like the wind, but I can't think."
You don't want a healthy leg.,"Oh, here we go."
"If you've got a good life, you're healthy, you've got no reason to bitch, no reason to hate life.","Well, here's the flaw in your argument if I enjoy hating life, I don't hate life, I enjoy it."
"I didn't say it was rational. They stop walking. HIV testing is ninety-nine percent accurate, which means there are some people who test positive, who live with their own impending doom for months or years before finding out Everything's okay. Weirdly, most of them don't react with happiness, or Even anger. They get depressed, not because they wanted to die, but because they've defined themselves by their disease. Suddenly, what made them 'them' isn't real.",I don't define myself by my leg.
"No, you have taken it one step further. The only way you could come to terms with your disability was to some way make it mean nothing. So you had to redefine Everything. You have dismissed anything physical, anything not coldly, calculatingly intellectual.",Why are you protecting her?
Because she's done nothing wrong?,You're completely comfortable with what she did to me?
"Yeah, I am. Yeah.",You agonize over moral choices.
You agonize over moral choices. You aren't completely comfortable with anything until you've taken days to get your head around Every possible side. I've known what she did for six hours. How come you're acting like you've known for days?,What do I have?!
You're not sick,What do I have?!?
You need to calm down,I have my brain. That's it!
We were trying to help you!,"Yeah, nobody tries to screw up, they just do!"
"You were out of control, you were shooting morphine",I can make people better! And you decide to trade that for jogging shoes!
If you're suffering from side effects then we can look at that and,"You value the physical so much, let me put this in terms you understand! He punches Wilson in the jaw."
"You're unbelievable. Even when you're out of your mind with anger and fear, you still couch it in logical terms. Are you hallucinating?","Yeah, I'm hallucinating!"
"No, I mean right now. His voice starts to morph into Jack's. Are you hallucinating?",How did you know I was
You were yelling at me. You were calling me Wilson.,No.
"You're losing it, House.",I nEver called Wilson by his name.
"Oh, yeah, right. The hallucinator is going to tell the hallucinatee what happened.","You're not the hallucinatee, Wilson was the hallucinatee."
You think maybe you're focusing on the wrong thing here?,"Cuddy's office was the hallucinatee, the bathroom was the hallucinatee."
Ah. Bathroom. It figures.,What figures?
You wet your bed.,Damn it. He tries to hide it as the team enters. They don't notice it at all.
Test was negative.,No.
Efp and beta HGG say no testicular cancer.,"So, let's recap. We've just ruled out Everything, which doesn't make sense, and the answer has to be something that does make sense. Do a cystoscopy, make sure he's huMan."
Test was negative.,For him being huMan?
"Most likely scenario is some kind of bacterial prostatitis. House looks up the stairs, walks up them.",Hmm.
He doesn't clearly have anything.,How did I get here?
What are you talking about?,"I was in the ICU, and then I was coming down these stairs with you guys. What happened in between? I don't remember how I got here."
"I was in the ICU, and then I was coming down these stairs with you guys. What happened in between? I don't remember how I got here.",I'm taking myself off my case.
"Your Patient's in critical care, he's had a fEver unabated for two",I think I'm losing my mind. I'm having blackouts.
You said you weren't having any,I lied.
"If you are doing this to scare me, you made your point. Next time you get shot, I promise to only treat the bullet wounds.",I'm off the case. as he turns to leave Why did you jump up when I came in?
I thought you were going to attack me again.,Again?
"Yeah, you were in my face. You were","No, I wasn't."
You came in here with Wilson and,That was a hallucination
"That was a hallucination No, you",-- which means this is a hallucination.
-- which means this is a hallucination.,"How can I tell what's real and what's not? Everything looks the same, sounds the same, tastes the same."
Seems like I'd be the last person you'd want to ask.,"Why not? You're obviously not here. I'm obviously not here, which means this is a creation of my mind, which means I'm really just asking my mind."
"You're talking to yourself, there's a lot of unnecessary explanation.","Hey, I'm trying to work this out. That requires give and take, Even in my own mind."
"All right, what was the question?",How can I tell what's real?
Does it matter?,That doesn't sound like something I'd ask.
"All right, your concern is that if you act in the real world based on information that's not real, the results are impossible to foresee.",With you so far.
"But information is incapable of harm in and of itself. Ideas are neither good nor bad, but merely as useful as what we do with it. Only actions can cause harm.",That sounds like me.
"So you do nothing, you refrain from taking any actions. Continue to throw out your ideas as you always would, but if they're based on faulty assumptions your team will point that out. They won't do anything that could hurt him.",So I trust my team.
No structural abnormalities.,"Something doesn't make sense. What does that mean? It's not rhetorical. I need your input on Everything I ask, no matter how obvious it might seem."
It means you're wrong.,"It means one of your assumptions is wrong, because if something doesn't make sense it can't be real. So what are our assumptions?"
"We've already redone them, twice.",Let's go more basic.
What's more basic than the test results?,Tests themselves. What does a biopsy consist of?
You take a sample,Define sample.
"It's a small, representative piece of whatEver you think is the pRoblem.","You go down the shore, you fill a cup with water. It's got no fish in it. Does that mean no fish in the ocean?"
We can do another biopsy?,"We can fill another cup of water, but we've gotta dive in. We've gotta see what's actually in there."
"Yeah, because he bled from where he wasn't supposed to bleed, causing parts of his body to blow up! Assuming that crazy assumption is correct, we operate on him, we'll kill him.",What if we could find a way of doing the surgery without giving him more than a papercut?
A person will be controlling the,People suck.
"If all you care about is that something's done right, pick the guy with the metal head. No way.",No way no way. You've gotta see this thing in action before you say no way. Come on. He helps Vince to sit up.
"House, what are you doing?",Nothing.
"Nothing. I'm not doing anything. Just throwing out ideas. I think you should put him in a wheelchair and take him down to the OR, but I may be out of my mind.","Relax, Cameron."
"And then he cuts off a button on her blouse, peeling part of the shirt away to rEveal her bra. House.",Does that hurt. Cameron shakes her head. Seen enough?
Seen enough? No.,"That wasn't a question. You either do this, or you die."
You've wasted your life.,Yeah. If only I'd dediCated my life to finding someone worthy to shoot.
"If I'd've killed you, would it have mattered?",Not to me. House is searParkng for a pen to write on the board with.
You don't care whether you live or die?,"I care because I live. I can't care if I'm dead. He moves to the wall, dragging the bed with him because he's still chained to it."
I don't want to hear seMantics.,You anti-seMantic bastard.
"Would anybody care that the world lost that wit? As Jack speaks, House writes on the glass board with a white marker.","Working, here."
"That's all right, you don't have to say anything. Just let me soak into your subconscious. You think that the only truth that matters is the truth that can be measured. Good intentions don't count, what's in your heart doesn't count, caring doesn't count, that a Man's life can't be measured by how Many tears are shed when he dies. It's because you can't measure them. It's because you don't want to measure them. Doesn't mean it's not real.",looking at his makeshift whiteboard That does not make sense.
"And Even if I'm wrong, you're still miserable. Did you really think that your life's purpose was to sacrifice yourself and get nothing in return? No. As Jack speaks, we see House in a car with the Woman he was speaking to earlier. The car is in a smoke-filled garage. You beliEve there is no purpose to anything. Even the lives you save you dismiss. You turn the one decent thing in your life and you taint it, strip it of all meaning. You're miserable for nothing. I don't know why you'd want to live.",I'm sorry. I know what's wrong.
"House, get out of here! You're not sterile!",He'll be fine.
Great. What's he got?,"How come you guys have nEver tried to yank me off this case? I'm having hallucinations, blackouts."
"But you're always insane, and you're always right.",I'm almost always Eventually right.
We've worked with you long enough to know,I know the test results Even before you enter the room. We have identical knowledge. How is that possible?
How is that possible? You're wrong.,Something doesn't make sense.
"House, you're losing it.",I've lost it. He starts to move his hand toward the Robot controls Chase grabs it. Why did you stop me?
Because I think you're going to kill him.,You don't think that.
"Hey, hey! This is a nightmare, you're gonna wake up. It's real, you're killing a Man!","It's also possible I may already be dead, but I don't beliEve in the afterlife."
"House, go back to your room. If this is a hallucination, it's a good one you're pain free, you can walk","This is not real, therefore it's meaningless."
"Once in the abdomen, once in the neck.",Hello.
It's going to be okay. You're going to be okay.,You don't know that. Tell Cuddy I want ketamine.
You ran here?,It's just... 8 miles.
Why did you...? Holding the bottle of water.,Why does a dog lick its He takes the water from her hand and starts to drink it. Yes he's just drinking her water. workplace acceptable euphemism for testicles?
Because he can.,What have you got for me boss?
I thought you said you needed 8 weeks of rehab. You should have been back here,He puts down the water and picks up a file.
You're completely pain free? The ketamine treatment can wear off.,It's been 2 months. It's not wearing off. What have you got for me? He picks up one of the files and starts looking through it himself.
It can take as long as--,Why are we having this discussion?
Middle-aged Man had hair transplant about 2 months ago--,"Infection throwing clots, you're an idiot."
"Girl was doing an inverted yoga pose, neck snapped, paralyzed from the neck down except the x-rays show no evidence of spinal injury. And she's cute.","Oh, well played sir! He grabs the file off Cuddy but continues to read the one in his hands. What about Stephen Hawking trying to do the 500 butterfly?"
"Forget it - brain cancer, brain surgery - there's nothing left to diagnose. I would take the other one.",Hmm... I'll take them both.
You don't think he had brain cancer?,Of course he had brain cancer Even oncologists don't screw up for 8 years.
So if there's no diagnostic issue why are you taking the case?,Treatment can be interesting.
Not to you.,I've changed.
"No, you haven't.","No, I haven't."
Then why are you taking the case?,Guy tried to kill himself.
"The guy had cancer, he's a lump he hasn't been able to touch his wife, speak to his kids.","He's been in that chair for 8 years, his muscles have atrophied. Maybe I can help him with the pain. Isn't that enough of a reason to want to help?"
Not for you.,I've changed.
No you haven't.,Then why am I taking this case? He suddenly sprints ahead of Wilson and runs off.
Then why am I taking this case? He suddenly sprints ahead of Wilson and runs off.,Let's start with the cute paraplegic.
You look... Healthy.,"Quad with no broken neck, struck me as odd."
Uhh... you could take a whole 2 minutes to ease into being back.,"Taken a whole month to ease back, 8 weeks is the maximum rehab time for a gunshot wound to the stomach and neck."
We heard they nEver found the guy. There's no new leads?,What? You think he might have shot this Patient too? Would explain her symptoms!
Could be MS.,See? It's not so difficult.
See? It's not so difficult.,"It's not MS. She had no symptoms before she climbed on to her head. Unless she's been upside-down for the last 10 years, MS ain't it."
The leg looks fine. You totally pain free?,When did this turn into 'what did you do over your summer vacation'?
I asked Cuddy to replace the carpet.,"No, I like the carpet. What did you do over the summer?"
What did you do over the summer? Enthusiastically. I--,Re-do the tests.
You don't think that's from the pool he drank?,"Give him an O2 mask. His leg muscles have atrophied, tendons have shortened from disuse causing intense pain. Tendon surgery will make him more comfortable."
Comfortable? Raised eyebrows from the Ducklings.,Scoot.
Thanks for being here.,Not a pRoblem.
My dad wouldn't kill himself.,You haven't spoken to him in over 6 years.
He wouldn't kill himself.,Fine. I'm wrong. You obviously have a better understanding of this Man who drools in front of your TV set 24 hours a day.
"Look, he must have been confused. It must have been an accident.",Hope it was a suicide attempt.
We were doing the EMG but we nEver got past the insertion of the conduction pin. Did she just say thank you?,I loaned her some money. What went wrong?
Nothing went wrong.,Nothing went wrong then something went right.
You're not going to tell me why she thanked you?,You're not going to tell me what went right?
You did something for which she is grateful and you're... embarrassed?,"For you. Saw you coming up, thought you were a 14-yr-old boy, I set her straight."
"I'm not telling you what went wrong - or right, until you tell me why she said thank you. She stands with hands on hips.","Ohhh, you got me."
It's either that or a reflex response.,What happened?
"Ok, this is Dr. House. House, this is Caren--","Pleasure's all mine, what happened?"
"When we inserted the conduction pin, she flinched.",To Cameron as she walks in. She flinched! Did you hear?
Does that mean I'm getting better?,How big is a flinch? Bigger than a twitch? Smaller than a spasm? Chase inserts the pin again so House can see the flinch. You smoke?
"Socially, a lot.",You do yoga and you smoke?
I know it's hypocritical but--,"Not at all, the world sees your legs, no one's checking out your lungs. He goes and checks out Caren's handbag."
How would smoking cause--,"It wouldn't, just needed a lighter."
House! My god!,Gives the puppy dog eyes. The case was looking so promising.
"Hey, I'm not faking.","You moved, therefore you can move. Get this lunatic out of here before she bores again."
"I heard you were watParkng surgery with a Patient's family. Talking to a Patient's family. It's because of your hallucination, isn't it? After you were shot? You chose life you decided you wanted meaning, so you took a case with no mystery. Something any doctor could do. A case with no upside except the satisfaction of helping another huMan being.",She thanked me.
And... you felt nothing.,Wasn't Even sure what I was supposed to feel.
"Sorry, need you, again.",Told you to get rid of her.
"It's a good thing we didn't. Tightness in her chest, she can't breathe, it could be pleural effusion.",Right. Either that or she's holding her breath like a 4-yr-old.
Right. Either that or she's holding her breath like a 4-yr-old.,Relax.
We should give her a local.,That would defeat the point of me being nasty.
But she can't breathe if she's down.,Down!
She can't breathe--,Down!
PRoblem's in her heart.,Can't fake that.
Or vasculitis would also explain the effusion.,But not the paralysis. Let's assume that she wasn't faking it.
"She moved, therefore she could move. She wasn't paralyzed.",Ehh...
"And she's been scanned up and down, it's all clean.","So, open her up, and find it. He bounces the ball he normally plays with on Chase's head - to Chase's annoyance."
So what do you want us to do? Start at her neck and just keep cutting down her spine until we stumble on something?,That should work. He tosses the ball back to Chase before walking out the door.
That should work. He tosses the ball back to Chase before walking out the door.,His heart rate's a little high.
Should I be worried?,PRobably just means he's still in discomfort from the surgery. I'm going to up his morphine a little.
You've been so nice to us.,That's the job.
"No, I mean all the other doctors, all they did was obsess on the... the cancer, the treatment, the damage... just trying to fix him. You're the first doctor that's Ever given a damn about the quality of his life.","His heart rate's come down, the morphine worked I was right."
What a touParkng moment. That's why we become doctors. For those rare moments when our hearts are warm--,Would you like to get a drink?
Are you serious or are you just trying to change the subject?,"No, I'm serious."
"No, I... it's just... you're just coming off the surgery and you're not yourself yet and I work for you and Even though last year's... Frustrated sigh as House starts smiling smugly. you're smiling! I'm saying no and you're smiling!","Oh, don't take it personally."
You've been back at work 24 hours and you're already playing hide and seek in a Woman's spine.,Who won the pool?
"There's no tumor. Her platelets are normal, scans--",What's the worst that can happen? I paralyze her. She won't Even notice.
Her Lawyers might. You're not doing the surgery. And lower the morphine on your other Patient.,"Sits down in the chair opposite Cuddy. Fine, I'll lower it. If you'll let me do the surgery."
What? You want a trade? We're not swapping a couple of goats for your help putting up a barn.,"You want something, I want something. We compromise. It's the grown-up way to resolve our differences."
You tried to swap?,"Ran a few more tests, came back negative, surgery's on."
"You really don't give a crap, do you?",Does that make me evil?
Does that make me evil? Yeah.,"The girl's life is at stake, what we're talking about with the guy--"
What we're talking about is the reason you took the case to help someone.,Too bad for them.
The fifth lEvel of happiness involves creation. Changing lives.,Sixth lEvel is heroin sEventh lEvel is you going away.
"House, you're not--",I'm not an idiot. To nurse. Move.
"House, leave her alone.","Close her up, you wanna know why?"
The room's no longer sterile.,"True, it's not the most interesting reason."
What the hell has that got to do with--,Told you it was interesting it gets Even better.
"The uh... nurse changed his morphine, I thought you were worried about--",It's just post-op discomfort. He's ready to go home.
So he won't have any pain?,Eventually.
Eventually. Thank you.,Everything else will be the same.
"Well, you took away his pain and that, that changes a lot.",Why don't you put him in some sort of... facility? Some place without a pool.
"Yeah. I could dump him there, except he's my husband. He's my son's father.",Right. Kids need a dad someone to play catch with. Talk about girls.
Mark's learned that you don't have to abandon someone just because--,Get a dog.
I'm taking care of him for the same reason you helped us.,Some guy shot you and you hallucinated?
I have a responsibility.,"So he's just an anchor weighing you and your family down, sapping your energy, wasting your life - that's the meaning you take from this?"
I want to take care of him.,You enjoy this?
I can't abandon him.,"So you don't want to take care of him. Taking care of him doesn't fulfill you, make you happy. But not taking care of him would make you miserable."
"I don't need your help, I've done this a million times.","Here, let me..."
"Here, let me...","Do that again, make that sound."
What was that?,That... was talking.
That... was talking.,You guys are lousy doctors. You're in such a rush to make the Patient feel better you forgot to check what was wrong.
"Yoga girl walked out of here 2 hours ago, you fixed her.","Not her, the other guy."
He had brain cancer they removed it 8 years ago. His condition's been the same Ever since.,"Until last night, he spoke."
What'd he say?,Guhhhhhhh.
You want us to dissect 8 years of medical history with grunting in the differential?,Sounds good. Call me when you're done.
You're fabricating a mystery because you're bored.,I am not bored.
You didn't tell the wife it was only a grunt?,"Of course not, because then she would nEver have consented to a bunch of dangerous tests. I don't remember you being this bitchy."
"The Vicodin dulled it, in the sober light of day I'm a buzz kill. You're giving false hope to a family that's been wrecked. Don't torture them, let it go, tell the wife it was only a grunt, tell her to go home.","Can't let her down like that, pumped her up with too much false hope."
"In 8 years the Patient experienced 214 symptoms, Many of them repeating.",Any patterns?
"If you add pain into the mix, fEver, frequent urination could indiCate a kidney pRoblem.",I like it.
"No, creatinine and BUN were both normal.","Not the kidney part, the pain part. Abdominal pain plus all that stuff could equal a pancreatic cyst."
"Perfect, you Managed to pick the one symptom he nEver had. Abdominal pain.",It's the first symptom on the board. Grunt.
Grunting isn't pathognomonic for abdominal pain.,"No, traditional diagnostic marker is compression of the diaphragm, vibration of the larynx leading to the audible sound 'I have a pain in my abdomen'."
Richard's symptoms are culled from 8 years of medical history. They're not patterned. These are random individual Events over time.,Illnesses have incubation periods. Do an upper endoscopic ultrasound.
"His throat will collapse, muscle degeneration in his neck won't tolerate the scope, it's an automatic trach!",You're talking about him like he's an invalid.
"Yeah, we're insensitive.","Does he drool? Can he hold his neck straight? Does he choke on his food? His neck's fine, his throat's not going to collapse. Cameron, get consent from the wife."
"We trached him, endoscopically removed the pRobe and he's breathing again. So, all in all, great idea.",Get a look at the pancreas before the world ended?
"Which means barring anything else, meaning you, he can go home tomorrow.",This Man nearly died. How can you discharge him?
"You stick something down someone's throat, they gag, spasm, which he did. It took us a half an hour to get that thing out.",Except that our Patient's throat was sedated.
Stop it. She stands up and stands in his way so he can't skateboard past her. You're enjoying this.,I find it interesting.
It's interesting only if you're right if you're wrong we're torturing this guy to amuse you.,Turns to Foreman. Half hour to remove the pRobe? Foreman nods.
Foreman nods. House.,It's not a spasm.
"There are no lesions on his brain, nothing to interrupt the new orders.",All it takes is one wire down.
You have no evidence of any wires down.,"A few micro-tumors on the meninges, suddenly you're choking to death."
He will bleed into his brain!,"No, he won't."
Because that wouldn't be interesting. You can get permission this time.,The brain is enclosed in a sac called the meninges--
Does this mean that the cancer's back?,"No, no, no, no."
"No, no, no, no.","If we found cancer, it wouldn't be the original cancer. It'd be new."
"So what, more surgery? More radiation?",Might not be the worst thing. If this isn't just ancient history then maybe it's something we can correct. Might Even get some brain function back.
He could get better? No!,But understanding what you're saying would be nice. Maybe you can figure out ways to communiCate.
You're lucky he didn't die.,I'm lucky? He's the one who didn't die.
We told you he'd hemorrhage.,"Told me he'd bleed into his brain, not out of his ear."
You've got to drop this.,We're missing something.
"We did a dangerous test and something bad happened, that's all this is.","Gets off the stool and starts looking at the scans up close. Give me a tour of the brain, Foreman. Walk me through the scans. 1998, what happened?"
5 cm grade 4 astrocytoma between the parietal--,"Nothing. Next, a speck on the superior temporal region."
"It's a regrowth, benign.",Star thingy next to the Rathke cleft.
"House Every speck is not a suspect, its years of surgeons digging around in his head. Let him go.",Re-do Every blood test he's Ever had. Re-scan his head.
"No. House turns around to look at her. He's been sick and suffering for 8 years, I'm not going to help you make it worse I'm not going to help you make it interesting.","That's ok, Foreman's better at that stuff than you are. We need 5mm cuts through the occipital and hypothalamic regions."
"How Many millimeters? House looks at Cameron like, 'this is why he's bee around longer than anyone else.'",I can help him.
That's it? That's your argument?,Seems like a good one.
"If I thought for a second you wanted to help him, you'd have carte blanche. You're doing this because it's fun.",Does nobody in this hospital have anything better to talk about than my motives? My motives have nothing to do with the case.
Your motives have Everything to do with your judgment.,"For the first time in years I've got no opiates in my body, now you question my judgment."
"24 times a year you come storming into my office spouting that you can help someone. Only you nEver say those words, you say something like his pancreas is going to explode because his brain is on fire! You come here with medicine, not with platitudes.",I didn't want to bore you with the details.
The answer's no. Cuddy called 30 seconds after you left and said you'd try an end around.,My leg hurt.
Looks up suddenly. How bad?,Enough that I'm telling you.
Did it go away?,Ached for a while. First time I felt anything there since the surgery.
But it went away?,"It was muscular, it was some cramping. Wilson smiles. What are you smiling about?"
"You're 40 something years old, you've been running God knows how Many miles a day, fallen a hundred times off that skateboard and you're shocked to have some soreness?",Just give me a prescription.
"For Vicodin? House, people get aParkng joints, cramps, they put on an ice pack, they take some ibuprofen.",I know what the pangs of middle age feel like.
"No, you don't, because you've been stuffing vicodin Every 5 minutes since you turned middle age.",The surgery didn't work.
Don't play me.,You think this is a scam?
"I think you want me to feel sorry for you and either do the end around on Cuddy or give you the drugs. He takes his pad of prescription slips and puts it away in a drawer under his desk deliberately to make his point. Either way, you get the high you think you need. House resignedly is about to leave the room. House, your surgery worked, you're fine. It's just going to take time for it to feel good.",Whispered. Come on. He gestures for her to open her window so he can talk to her.
Whispered. Come on. He gestures for her to open her window so he can talk to her.,"Circumventricular system sends his cytokines, releasing the early stages of the immune response but CDOS releases prostaglandins that reset the hypothalamic set point upward, unless it's countered by antipyretic therapy."
And you discovered this when you stepped into the university pool? She fetches him a towel and hands it through the window.,Fountain. I can cure him.
"Cure him? Even if the fountain proved anything, fixing hypothalamic dysregulation isn't going to regenerate brain.","No, but if the scar tissue on his hypothalamus is resting against the pituitary, the adrenals would shut down. Addison's disease."
"You didn't see any scar tissue on his MRI, his CT scan--",His brain is functional.
His temperature's normal. There is nothing wrong with his hypothalamus or his pituitary!,I can make him walk! I can make him talk!
This is a wild guess! That came to you because you were! sweating.,Inject him with cortisol.
She nods. You're high.,"I told you, I haven't had anything in 3 months."
This is as high as you get. A theory that ties your case up in a neat little bow but you don't have a lick of substantiating proof.,Sighs.
He's on his way out of here. Figure you'd be on your scooter racing down the halls to stab the Patient in the neck with cortisol.,She was right to say no. I had no objective reason to think that I was right. Just needed the puzzle.
Ah. Where's the sweat and the B.O? You've taken such pride bathing us in your personal musk.,Showered at home.
And yet you're earlier than usual.,"Is this an intervention? It's a little late, since I'm not using drugs anymore. I am, howEver, still hooked on phonics."
If you still did your morning run and showered at home you'd be later than usual.,Thought of you in the shower.
How's your leg? You seem to be favoring your left side.,I was hanging down my right pant leg yesterday. Makes all the difference in the world. Gets into the elevator.
You've taken the stairs Every day.,Do I need a restraining order?
"Kid is a product of an in vitro fertilization pregnancy. Had all his vaccinations, fractured his right ulna at age three, Parkcken pox at age five","He Ever get his feelings hurt? I'll need to know that, too."
Maybe we should talk to the kid.,"Why, in case he's telling the truth? You're a beliEver, aren't you?"
"Well, I'm just not arrogant enough to think that of the 50 billion galaxies, 100 billion stars per galaxy, and 10 million billion planets in the universe that we're the only ones with life.",No. But I'm guessing we're the only ones who like shoving things through our back doors.
There is new research indicating a link between neurological pRoblems and bleeding disorders.,Perfect. Especially if there were neurological pRoblems.
What part of hallucinating an alien abduction isn't neurological?,"Well, why is that a hallucination?"
What? You think the kid,He's having nightmares.
"His alien abduction story! the lEvel of detail is... I don't know where he gets it from. The parents say he doesn't watch sci-fi, he doesn't read comic books",Great! You do any of that medical stuff we talked about?
Upper and lower endoscopies were clean.,So it's a simple bleeding disorder.
"No, blood tests were all normal. And he clotted in six minutes.",So it's a simple bleeding disorder and you screwed up the test.
I didn't screw up the test!,"So it's a UFO, unidentified flowing orifice."
Kid's got a bleeding disorder.,You sure?
Had to stop the bleeding myself after 25 minutes.,So you're saying Chase did screw up.
Big hand points to minutes. Maybe you got them mixed up?,"Oh, snap! Foreman's playing the dozens you're at a cultural disadvantage here. Take a few minutes to think up a witty retort."
So we have contradicting bleeding time tests. If we run labs to check his clotting factors we can confirm which one's right.,"Yeah, testing, nice idea. Way better than trying to guess which doctor's incompetent. Much better than the paperwork, too."
House! Clancy's gone missing.,"Oh, no!"
"Clancy, stop! There is no Parkp! We're going to clean you up, and we're going to go back to your room. You can't do things like this. Your parents! Chase stops, because he sees something shiny through the blood.",Results came back. The lab cannot identify the metal. They said it might not Even be terrestrial.
They said it might not Even be terrestrial. Really?,"No, you idiot! It's titanium. Like from a surgical pin, like the kind the kid had inserted into his broken arm four years ago, nice medical history."
That pin was removed six months after,"So what, a little piece broke off during removal."
"Titanium is used to build nuclear subs, pieces don't just break off.",Tell that to the guys on the Kursk.
"To his lungs, maybe. Not his neck.",Yeah. An alien Parkp makes more sense. The real mystery is you didn't actually screw up. He stumbles.
He stumbles. You okay?,"Fine. I tripped. Kid carved a hole in the back of his neck, apparently didn't bleed to death. Now that's weird."
He clotted on his own?,"Sure did. So first there was no bleeding disorder, then there was, now there's not again."
Or Foreman screwed up. Two out of three tests agree with my findings.,"Lucky for us, the fourth test will be the charm."
"He's in ICU, systolic is hovering around 170, I left instructions to lower it slowly so we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.","Tradeoff being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke, MI, and blindness."
I'm open to suggestions.,Solve the case. Kidneys could
Kidneys are clean. They enter the lab.,Fingers crossed. Tell me he's a mutant huMan hybrid.
Right. Kids always cheat on their bleeding time tests.,"She was being metaphorical. Trying to sound like me. I have no idea what you meant, but I could smell what the Rock was cooking."
"I meant, he's clotting right now and he's in hypertensive crisis. Maybe the two are related. What if he was hypertensive the other two times that he clotted?",Hypertensive crisis can activate clotting factors. Even someone low on von Willenbrand's could theoretically clot.
And the first time Clancy clotted he was all worked up recounting his alien abduction he could have easily have been hypertensive.,I know I get worked up when I cut microParkp tracking implants out of my neck.
Sounds like a cheat to me.,"Yeah, we get it. Okay, what's the differential for a sEven-year-old boy suffering multiple hypertensive crises?"
"It's clean, his heart isn't the pRoblem.",Why don't I have hi-def in my office? I'm a department head!
Valves are intact.,Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.
Tissue characterization is impossible when the pixels are the size of Legos.,"See, this is what I'm talking about. Foreman, you've got to steal this thing for me."
"The clearer the image, the clearer it is that there are no masses, no clots, no tears. The pRoblem's got to be somewhere else.",We're gonna need a bigger boat.
Think he'll make us break into the IMAX before he admits it?,There.
There. Where?,Right there.
We don't have a laser pointer.,"Well, why not?"
So you found an arrhythmia.,"That's not an arrhythmia, that's a no-rhythmia. Myocytes contract, these aren't moving at all. Go get me those myocytes I want to talk to them in my office."
How's the kid doing?,Heart nearly exploded.
What's going on with the leg?,"First, tell me what's going on with the boobs."
If you're feeling pain,They're firmer.
It's called an underwire. I want to get a PET scan of your brain.,I think it's hormones.
As long as there's no increased activity in the thalamus,Looks to me like those puppies are going into the dairy business.
"-- Then the pain can be good. It could be muscle regenerating. After you work out, you get sore. Pain doesn't mean the ketamine failed.",Guess I should be saying 'mazel tov.' Who gets to pass out the cigars?
I'm not pregnant. I need to get a PET scan of your brain.,Boy or girl? You got a name picked out?
I'm not pregnant!,My leg doesn't hurt.
You're in denial!,"No, I'm not! Oh, you got me. If I thought my leg was deteriorating, don't you think I'd want to take steps to prEvent that?"
Sighs. Okay. House's beeper beeps.,"Gotta go. As he leaves, he fake stumbles. Cuddy helps him up He gives her a look with a ha."
"Here's Clancy's DNA, and here's the DNA from the piece of that heart we just biopsied. They don't match.",That is impossible. Run it again.
The genes from Clancy's myocytes don't match the genes from the rest of his body. Alien DNA.,Anybody watch any X-Files that inspired an explanation?
There are ways DNA could become mutated. Extreme UV radiation.,"That much sun, he'd be dying with a healthy bronze glow."
Nitrous acid or ethidium bromide exposure.,"So first Daddy was a rapist, now he's a chemist."
Various species of fungus have been proven mutagenic.,"Not unless the kid's been eating barrels of celery or living in Indonesia, or both."
Is your leg hurting?,Is that question helping?
Is that question helping? You're leaning.,You're sitting.
You're sitting. You're evading.,"My head's hurting. Please, someone give me a plausible, terrestrial explanation for this kid's alien DNA."
What if we find the heart cells with the bad DNA and we tag them?,Can you phrase that in the form of a metaphor?
"It's the same way we search for cancer. The bad DNA creates a unique protein on the surface of the affected cells. We create an antibody that recognizes only that protein and we flush it throughout his system, and the similar cells light up like light bulbs.","Okay, let's do that."
You want to go for a run?,What do you want?
I want you to run. He throws House a bottle of Vicodin.,When did you become an enabler?
"I'm enabling you to exercise. Vicodin blocks the pain, you get through your rehab, muscle strength increases, and pain decreases.",I'd rather not become dependant on pain pills to get through my day. He throws them back.
You're just like any other Patient running away from knowledge that won't make you happy.,I'm as happy as a pig in poop.
You're scared the ketamine treatment's wearing off. That it was just a tortuous window of the good life.,What part of poop didn't you understand?
How can you be so sure it isn't just a sore muscle?,It's my leg. We've known each other a long time.
We didn't miss anything. Brain scan was completely clean.,Our tag must not have penetrated the blood-brain barrier. Don't use an IV this time get it right into the brain.
"His scan was clean, twice! It's not there! House sits making them pause.",What if it is there but didn't show up on the scan?
Where are we going?,I am going to think.
I am going to think.,Send the kid home.
What do you mean?,Make sure his blood pressure's stabilized and send him home.
Like nothing Ever happened?,"We cured his bleeding disorder, removed all the damaged cells we could find."
"We don't know that we fixed anything, it's only been a day. Maybe these symptoms come and go like the blood disorder.",It's more pRobable that his remaining symptoms are just a nightmare.
He had a convulsion.,"May be epilepsy, may be psychological, may be nothing."
House! You're just giving up on this kid?,You've got to know when to stop.
"You don't stop, you nEver stop, you just keep on going until you come up with something so insane that it's usually right.",Except on my last case.
Don't be pathetic. Just forget the last case. This kid obviously has something wrong with him.,"When did you dEvelop such strong opinions about my Patients? Last week you were convinced that my Patient wasn't sick, now you're convinced this one is."
"This one is a young boy. His parents are desperate. Just get together with your team, spend a few extra hours","Well, I guess we could amputate his left leg. That's where we found most of it. Maybe we could just remove his affected eye completely."
If you have reason to beliEve that that might help,"I'm not going to start lopping off body parts, but it's interesting that you'd give me the green light."
I just want you to do something.,You've been overly supportive this entire week. Either you're hormonal or you're guilt-ridden. And it's too early in the pregnancy for this to be hormonal.
I'm not pregnant.,Then what did you do wrong?
"He had Addison's, your last Patient. You were right. I gave him one shot of cortisol and he woke up like Rip van Winkle.","To Cuddy's belly. Oh, your mommy's in such trouble. She's such a liar! That's why you don't have a daddy. That's why she had to And! epiphany."
"To Cuddy's belly. Oh, your mommy's in such trouble. She's such a liar! That's why you don't have a daddy. That's why she had to And! epiphany.",How does one person end up with two different sets of DNA?
We've been through this.,Our assumptions are faulty.
"We've confirmed two different sets of DNA, we re-ran the sequence.","I didn't say the lab work was faulty, I said our assumptions were faulty. We assumed he's a person."
"Of course, the aliens didn't just visit him, they replaced him.","Well, you're being silly. What if he's not a person, what if he's two persons?"
I'm not getting the metaphor.,"No metaphor. Chase, you said the mom used in vitro fertilization, right?"
"Yeah, they had trouble conceiving.","The kid was right all along, he was implanted with something."
But he doesn't have a twin.,Not walking around.
"Not walking around. But in vitro fertilization costs about 25 grand a pop. CGI of! well, cells merging. So doctors implant about two to six embryos to make sure you get your money's worth. PRoblem is, there's not always enough bedrooms for all of the kiddies. Two brothers get stuck sharing, there's no bunk beds, so they cuddle up to keep warm. They nEver untangle. He's two people in one. It's called Parkmerism.","Unfortunately, his brother's like a bad doubles partner."
"So does that mean you can find the bad cells in his brain, or not?","Sure, abandon the metaphor. Fine. Clancy thinks differently than his brother because he thinks. If we induce an alien abduction"
"Wait, what the hell are you talking about?",The foreign DNA has got to be in a portion of your son's brain that makes him beliEve that he's being abducted.
You're talking about brain surgery.,"I'm talking about really cool brain surgery. One of your sons will die, but the taller one won't be so annoying any more."
What's on the card? Light bulb.,"Start us out at ten. House is doing the brain surgery. Wait, what? Clancy's arm twitches."
I'm not doing that.,"That was all me, kid. Sorry."
Brain waves indiCate mild hallucination. Neurons lighting up.,Any dark spots?
Area's too fuzzy. Hallucination isn't strong enough.,"Well, turn up the juice."
His blood pressure's already 160/110. Any higher and,Riding the short bus is better than not breathing. Take us to 100.
Area's still too fuzzy to make any kind of distinction.,Crank it up higher!
You've already exceeded the preset maximum. Next step's brain damage.,In front of Clancy's face.
"Yep, we got them all.",Close him up.
Everything's going to be normal again.,You beliEve what Cuddy tried to pull?
You beliEve what Cuddy tried to pull? What now?,"She lied to me. She cured my Patient with my diagnosis, then lied to me about it."
That doesn't sound like her.,"You're right. It does sound like you, though."
What exactly did Cuddy tell you?,Nothing that your body language isn't telling me right now.
"Something like that. More that if we told you the truth that you'd solved the case based on absolutely no medical proof, that you'd think you were God. And I was worried your wings would melt.","God doesn't limp. House leaves and Wilson looks very, very tired."
"You're not gonna make this easy, are you? He picks up a syringe. Unfortunately as much as I admire your spirit, je ne sais rien.",71 year old cancer research specialist.
You! have your cane.,"No, why the lacerations are creepy."
So the! the pain's returned.,"There was no pain, he was unconscious. I'm guessing, because he wasn't able to breathe."
We're talking about you.,"Obviously. I'm obviously not. What is it with you people? I don't use the cane, you're shocked. I use the cane!"
We're just concerned.,"About the wrong person. I can breathe. Ezra Powell on the other hand, is gonna die."
The researcher? The guy who wrote that textbook?,"That textbook, THE textbook."
Wait - there's actually another doctor you admire?,"I! admire lots of doctors. 'Course most of them look a lot better in knee socks than Ezra Powell, but seeing as they can all breathe."
"So's his EKG, it's not his heart.",You're being too nice.
"At 71, we get his heart or lungs to give out we might not get 'em to give in again.",That's why we're gonna do it in a hospital.
"Stop, this isn't working.",His heart rate barely got above 90.
"He can't run, he can hardly walk.","It's 'cause he's not trying hard enough. If he was, his heart rate would go up."
Exercising with a lung full of your own bodily fluids tends to hurt.,They don't call it a stress test for nothing. Do it again.
You don't need a $400 handbag.,It's kinda hard to check your throat when you're flapping your gums around.
He starts filling out a prescription. What's that?,"Cold. He hands him the slip of paper. Take this 4 times a day, and stay off airplanes. Flying cesspools."
This isn't working. Dr. House!,Please don't get up. I'm sure you're very busy. He gets a syringe from a cart. I'm just gonna try and speed things up a little.
"No, he's right, let him -- let him do it.",See? That's why he doesn't have to wear knee socks.
He can't breathe.,"130. Powell looks scared, and like he can't breathe. The magic number. Nothing here. Foreman?"
Still no sign of blockage.,Which means it's not the heart.
He's thought this through it's not an impulsive decision.,Neither is mine. He's depressed. He'll feel much better after we cure him.
"He's seen all the tests we've seen. Even if we figure out what was causing the lung damage, it's too late to rEverse it.",You can't know that without knowing what's wrong.
"Whose side are you on, senator? First respect his wishes, then invade Iraq, then get the troops home. Make up your mind.",Wow.
Coming up with a new treatment isn't gonna do us any good unless we convince him it's worth trying.,"Oh, come on. He's old, and sick, and tiny. We can do whatEver we want to him."
You're wasting your time. There must be other Patients you could actually help.,"No, all services rendered on a first-come, first-served basis."
"House, you're hurting him.",You're hurting me.
"We don't choose our birth, and we don't choose our death.",What if you could?
House! Foreman shakes his head.,"24 hours. Come on, it's not gonna kill you."
You canNOT help him kill himself.,Of course I can. Chase says we do it all the time. Chase rolls his eyes.
Cuddy's not gonna let you!,Enough!
I'll draw cultures. Pneumonia should be bacteria in his blood.,It's gonna take longer than 24 hours.
"Not if I spin down the sample. Separate off the buffy coat, then gram stain for bacteria.",Nods.
All of that in 24 hours?,Nah. WhatEver you don't get done you can finish at the autopsy.
Purple dye on my fingers.,What'd the bone marrow biopsy show?
Don't have the results.,What? What've you been doing all night?
He hangs up. Who's that?,Your protg. What are these?
Dictation tapes. He records Everything.,Why?
Because he's a diligent researcher?,Or he's losing his memory.
A lot of people dictate their notes.,"Yes, we could assume that, and we'd have nothing."
I'll go get an MRI of his head.,Keep testing 'til you find something. I'm going to my office to rest for awhile. They all glare after him.
No abnormal nuclei means no leukemia he a drinker?,Not according to the history.
"Which means yes, he drinks, which gives us a nice mundane explanation for the acellularity.",Or he's telling the truth. Which means fungus is still on the table.
"But your entire view of huMan nature gets destroyed. He shrugs. Six of one, half a dozen of the other.",Bad news fast. Good news you can take your time.
"Head is clean. You were wrong, his faculties are intact.","Too bad. If his brain was addled, we wouldn't have to listen to anything he says."
It's 4 o'clock we have nothing to tell him.,Then we have no reason to talk to him. We still haven't ruled out fungus.
"Yup, we have. No buds, no hyphae.","Sighs. Okay. Next procedure we sneak in, turn back the clock. Wilson smiles, Cameron looks forlorn."
Whole team. Must Coughs. be bad news.,Nope.
What about my breathing?,Associated hyperviscosity syndrome gummed up the blood vessels in your lungs.
Dr. Chase said my calcium is normal.,"Mm. We call him Dr. Idiot. Chase rolls his eyes, Foreman crosses his arms."
There's no M-protein in my urine.,Odd presentation.
So odd that Dr. Cameron doesn't beliEve it either. House turns and glares at her.,Just give me 12 more hours.
We had a deal. No more tests.,Fair enough. Give me six more hours. Powell purses his lips. Listen there is no evidence that you are terminal.
You a Man of your word or not?,"No, as a matter of fact, I'm not."
Where you going? Nowhere.,Everybody who can walk should get outta here. House takes morphine and a syringe out of the kit.
You can't do that.,Can't do what? Administer a prescription painkiller to a Patient who's in pain? Go. Make sure somebody sees you downstairs in the cafeteria.
No it's about whether you die or we murder you.,"Holding up syringe, while talking to Foreman."
"Quietly, to House. Thank you. House gives a quick nod. I've always wondered exactly what was on the other side.",Nothing.
What are you doing?,"Getting a laryngoscope. House grabs a laryngoscope. Don't just stand there, help."
But you told him,Interrupting.
"Interrupting. Yeah. A little something I like to call a lie. Bad I know, but it's way further down the list than murder. He intubates Ezra and starts to pump the ambu bag. He's unconscious. No more whining. I'm gonna keep testing him. Chase looks confused and indignant. Go get a ventilator, not gonna do this all night.",We can legally assume that he'd consent to whatEver a reasonable person would consent to. Cut to House's office.
And a reasonable person would obviously consent to being put in a coma against their will just to satisfy your curiosity.,"Fake exasperation with a hint of real exasperation. I try to kill him, you're mad. I don't kill him you're mad."
All he wanted was some dignity.,Were you in that room with him?
"I wanted to get his brain-stem and his C-spine, make sure his diaphragm wasn't paralyzed.",You also caught the top of his lungs. There's scarring. Cameron is staring at him. You do know that you can't really pierce me with your stares.
Could be pulmonary fibrosis. Or Lupus.,"He can kill himself after we get him better. Start him on an IVIG for the Lupus, and get a colonoscopy. Lupus could be hiding there."
I can't do this. She leaves.,Drama queen.
I don't think she's gonna have a pRoblem deciding what to tell Cuddy. Ezra's heart monitor starts beeping. O2 sats 89 and dropping.,Thought you were only supposed to put on a pound a week during your last trimester.
Sighs. I'm not pregnant. I heard about your little stunt with Dr. Powell.,"Makes a drawn out whining sound. Not really a stunt. More of a trick, a ruse, a hoodwink."
"More of a trick, a ruse, a hoodwink. A lie.",Ok.
He's not gonna learn anything I just thought the same principle might apply. It does.,I coulda just let him die.
Not gonna get sued for keeping him alive.,"Well, we could we completely disregarded his wishes."
"Do you want me to disagree with you? Turns to House, they stop walking. Sarcastically. Want me to yell at you?",It is comforting.
"We're doctors We treat Patients, we don't kill them.","Raises voice, speaking into her lapel pin as though it is a microphone."
I'm sorry about your leg.,Yeah. Walks away. We really should spend some time talking about that. Cuddy sighs.
The IVIG made him worse. O2 stats plummeted.,Sighs. So we know it's not Lupus. What else could it be?
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,Gonna need an open lung biopsy to confirm. House goes into a lounge Chase and Foreman follow.
"So, now we're going to operate on the guy?",Unless you've invented a new way of doing an open lung biopsy.
Unless you've invented a new way of doing an open lung biopsy.,"When you searched Dr. Powell's office, did you find a copy of the January, 1967 Massachusetts Medical Journal?"
"Powell's office, did you find a copy of the January, 1967 Massachusetts Medical Journal? Why?","I just figured, if you're not doing any work, you might like something to pass the time. Centerfold's a killer. House walks away, leaving Cameron curious."
"I just figured, if you're not doing any work, you might like something to pass the time. Centerfold's a killer. House walks away, leaving Cameron curious.",Fake cheering of an audience. Wilson enters.
How's your leg?,It hurts. Sighs. It's gonna keep on hurting. You gonna keep on asking?
How's Ezra Powell?,Resting comfortably.
"Hmm, that's not what Cameron says.",I hate practicing medicine in high school.
He's not asking you to help him kill himself he's just asking for help. The disease will kill him.,I know what he was asking for I just said 'no'.
You've done it before. Plenty of times.,To Patients that I knew were terminal.
"Annoyed. Oh, give me a break. This has nothing to do with saving a life you just can't bear the thought of a Patient dying before you've been able to figure out why.",If we're gonna keep refusing to cure Patients just to rein in my ego then we might start having a little pRoblem with Patient recruitment. House's pager goes off.
Snidely. Worried about meeting your one Patient a week quota?,"Leaving. I'm a cripple, remember. Accommodations must be made."
Why'd you have me look up that article?,Didn't you find it interesting?
He injected newborn babies with radioactive agents just to see if they had urethral reflux.,He was curious.
He didn't Even tell their parents he was doing an experiment.,He wasn't doing anything his peers weren't doing.
His peers at Tuskegee and Willowbrook?!,He ignored the rights of the few to save Many.
So you're okay with what he did.,Doesn't matter what I think. It's what you think that's relevant.
"Because, if I think less of him, I'll help you more? You're wrong. The fact that a Patient did bad things doesn't change anything. He still deserves to have some control over his own body.","If he had control of his own body, he'd be dead."
Some control. We can withhold treatment without killing him.,No you can't!
"No you can't! You either help him live, or you help him die you can't have it both ways. Chase looks up at House from the operating room and shakes his head.",Well I guess it's not IPF. Ezra's heart monitor starts beeping.
Well I guess it's not IPF. Ezra's heart monitor starts beeping.,"Well, maybe he'll die right now. Make Everything easy for all of us. He leaves and Cameron is alone in the observation room."
"BP's low. House takes stethoscope from random surgeon, then checks Ezra with it.",No breath sounds on the right side he's dropped his right lung.
"What are you doing? House prods Ezra's left foot, and it twitches.","Withdraws from pain stimuli on the left side, but not the right."
Those are just reflex arcs he's under anesthesia.,Or he's lost sensation in some places.
Or the hypoxia from the arrest stunned his CNS.,Only one way to tell. Do some ATA sensory evoked potentials.
We can't do that while he's in a coma.,Only two ways to tell. Get a hammer and check his deep tendon reflexes.
Won't work. He needs muscle relaxants to be on the ventilator.,"Long blink, thinking. Only one more way to tell. Pupillary reflexes."
All that tests is the brainstem.,"See, I was right only one way to tell. Do some ATA sensory evoked potentials."
I just said we can't do that while he's in a coma.,So wake him up. House leaves.
So wake him up. House leaves.,Don't go towards the light. You'll fall and break your hip.
What's happening? I --,You took a little nap.
"No, I! I told you I didn't want --","Interrupting. Sorry, little deaf in one ear. Your bone marrow was hypocellular we ruled out lupus and pulmonary fibrosis, but it looks like it could be attacking your nerves."
"So, this is all a waste, a huge fail! Gasps. failure. Impossible, you're Gregory House.",We need to attach some sensors to your skin.
We need to attach some sensors to your skin. No.,"Look, we can't do what you want we've assigned a nurse to watch you so you can't do it either."
Then take them out!,"Oh, get over yourself."
"Oh, get over yourself. The ventilator puffed up your lungs you'll be fine for a few hours. Just let us run the tests. Ezra rips off some leads that were attached to him.","Ok. But first, let's clean you up a little. He grabs a glass of water and splashes a few drops of it on Ezra's chest. That feel nice?"
Curious. What are you trying to prove?,Just cleaning him up.
"He does the same to his left, and this time the foot twitches. Get out!","Okay, I'm going already. Can't you see I'm a cripple? House leaves."
"Ok, so you got me curious.",I was right whatEver is attacking his lungs is attacking his nerves.
You got that by splashing ice water on him?,"No sensation in the left leg, abdomen, right arm. Technology's overrated."
That means the clean MRI of his brain means it's just affecting the peripheral nerves.,And bone marrow.
Or lymphoma. Or sarcoidosis.,All potentially treatable. Question is which. We need to catch the little bastards in the act. What's the largest organ?
What's the largest organ? Skin.,We need to get a piece. House leaves them standing there.
"Sure, we'll just wait until he leaves his room without his skin, sneak in, and take a piece. Chase snickers.",I want you to get a skin sample for a biopsy.
And I wanna get a foot massage from Johnny Damon.,"Walking towards the desk. Kawasaki's disease, lymphoma, and sarcoidosis are all treatable."
And it could be a hundred other things that aren't treatable. You have no idea.,But you do you know Everything.
I didn't say that I -,Slams cane down on desk.
I'm not gonna lie to him.,"Fine, tell the truth. Just get me a pound of flesh."
"Dr. House? House looks over in surprise. Hi, how are you?",Not as good as you think I am.
"Don't worry, I'm not stalking you. My dad just lost his medicine he had to come back for another prescription.","Yeah, right. He's moving it on the street, isn't he?"
Why haven't you returned any of my calls?,He stops and thinks. I plan to. In a couple of years.
I was just calling to say 'thank you.' And to tell you how impressed I was you diagnosed my dad by just looking at him.,"Felt his glands, too. Ali gives a slight laugh."
"Oh, there's my dad I gotta go.",Yeah. Me too.
"At a microscope as House enters. It's not Kawasaki's, either. What's next?",Congo red.
Congo red. Amyloidosis?,What the hell else would I mean by 'Congo red?'
There's no reason for it to be on the list.,An abnormal protein is building up inside the cells of his body shutting down his organs one by one.
"We rejected Amyloidosis, because it didn't fit the first symptom we found. It would affect his heart.",It did.
It wasn't on the stress test.,We didn't push him hard enough. To Chase. Add the stain let's find out.
Congo red added.,"Change the polarization of the light, already. Results confirm that it is Amyloidosis."
How the hell you pull that out of --,Interrupting. Not outta mine. I had a muse.
Everyone looks disheartened -- And House hands Cameron a candy bar. Dr. House.,"You have Amyloidosis it's in your lungs, kidneys, bone marrow, and brain."
Why should I beliEve you now?,"If I was lying, I wouldn't tell you the subtype is AA. It's terminal."
Ezra Powell passed away last night. I'm sure you already knew about that.,Shakes his head a little. No. I just got in.
"The nurse charted at 2 AM he was stable. Breathing labored, but regular. And at 230 he suddenly stopped. House is thinking. You know anything about that?","If I did, would you really wanna know? Cuddy nods and then leaves."
"If I did, would you really wanna know? Cuddy nods and then leaves.",Puts his hand on her shoulder. I'm proud of you.
"That's impossible, it's mac and cheese.",10-yr-old boy screams for his life for no reason.
"He's autistic, sEverely autistic. Can't talk, can't make eye contact. Screaming's pRobably his way of communicating.",And he went to 3 different doctors who all said just that.
"Wow, so clearly that can't be the answer. His brain can't filter information, it's a constant assault on his senses I'd scream too.",Or it's something medical sounding like dysesthesia.
Since when do we start believing parents? Or anyone? Where are we going?,Elevator.
"So they're overprotective and scared, that's all the more reason to--","They've studied this kid, heard him scream a million times. Did 10 years of caring for him, this is the first time they've brought him to a hospital."
ER said the heart was fine.,Don't be so quick to dismiss pain.
Where are we going?,"Down. Stool sample to check for parasites, blood culture to rule out infection and ANA for lupus."
"Could also be an environmental reaction an allergy, dust, wheat, pollen, a toxin.","Check the House. Run a lung ventilation scan. Lungs are in the chest too, right?"
"I had a date last night, she screamed. Should we spend a 100,000 dollars testing her?","Of course not, this isn't a veterinary hospital. Zing! He pushes the door open into the clinic. Look, if you don't think this kid is worth saving--"
That's not what I'm saying!,"Well that's too bad, it's a good point."
"Well that's too bad, it's a good point. Kid's just a lump with tonsils. You know what it's going to be like trying to put an autistic kid into a nuclear scanner? I don't envy you guys. He opens the door to Cuddy's office and leaves them to their job.","I want my old carpet back. He bangs his cane on to her desk, she's on the phone."
Err we're going to have to do this later. A kid in the clinic had an accident. She puts the phone down. Generally when people are on the phone--,I want my old carpet back.
"It was stained, with blood.","Yeah, my blood. Which makes the carpet part of me, I want it back. I want to be buried with it."
You think you can get me to do anything you want regardless of how stupid it is?,"It's my office it's where I work, where I think, where I save lives, allowing you to brag to rich people so they'll give you more money to spend on MRIs and low-cut tops."
"It's identical to the old carpet, except without the hazardous biological waste.",I shall not return to my office until Every patented durable microfibre has been restored to its rightful place.
"Inspiring. She puts up her feet on the desk. If you don't want to work in your office, work in the clinic. You don't want to work in the clinic, go home and don't get paid.",Banging on the floor with his cane. Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Stops banging the cane and looks at her. Attica?
Hey doctor House.,Hello girl whose name I don't remember but whose dad I treated so I don't really know why she's here.
Ali. Umm... I think I caught what my dad has. The rhino thing.,Right. He presses two fingers into two spots on her forehead. Does that hurt?
A little. It's in my chest too.,Of course it is.
That feels good.,Exactly when did New Jersey run out of horny 17-yr-old boys?
"The ventilation scan was normal, time to send him home.","Can't leave right now. Turns back to Ali. Well congratulations, you are the proud owner of your very own rhino thing."
A rhinovirus? You can't leave because she has a cold?,Can't leave because Cuddy says I can't leave.
"Hey, don't start with me. We're backed up.",I know this is hard for all of us but thanks to doctor Cuddy I don't have an office so I have to work here.
What'd she do to your office?,"It's unusable. So, whatEver's bothering him it wasn't his lungs. What about the kid's House?"
Which means there's nothing physically wrong with this kid.,We already had that discussion. Did we get a fecal smear? He purposely says the last bit louder to ick out the people in the clinic.
Should we do this some place else?,"Nope, Cuddy says I have to work here."
"Walking out of her office. No, I said you can work in your office or you had to work here.",And since I can't work in my office.
Is this your master plan? Disrupt hospital business until I replace your carpet?,"Devious. Saw it in a James Bond movie. Raising the volume. Fecal smear, talk to me!"
Get out of here.,Put back my carpet?
No! Get out of here!,"Fecal matter, is there a sample we can look at?"
"Do what you want, not replacing your carpet. She smiles in victory and struts back into her office.","Go up his rear and get a smear. Which reminds me, I kinda feel like a bagel. He walks out of the clinic."
Adam! Adam!,So what makes fluid fill the lining of a kid's lungs?
Why are we in here? This is some sort of power play?,Yeah.
Or do you really have a pRoblem with the carpeting? Change sets you off--,"I said it was a power play, someone answers yes to option A, you don't move on to option B."
Why now? Why a power play now?,I smelled weakness.
"That's funny it says Wilson, what a strange typo.",The fluid comes back in exudate get him on broad spectrum antibiotics.
Thank you for coming. No pRoblem.,Thought you wouldn't mind sharing offices for a while.
"You share stories, feelings... toys. You don't share offices.",That is so not Zen.
"It was a gift, some doctors get those.",So you want mornings or afternoons?
Hangs up his lab coat. You couldn't make Cuddy miserable so you're going to make me miserable so I can make Cuddy miserable on your behalf?,Yep.
What makes you think I can make her miserable? Starts rolling up his sleEves.,Because you're good at that stuff.
"Ohhh, I'm nothing compared to you.",Picks up a random toy. Is there anything you'll throw out?
"That's a gift from an 11-yr-old Patient of mine, she and I both knew it was a piece of junk and that's what made her laugh.",So you gotta keep it until she! He draws his hand across his neck and makes an execution sound.
What are you doing here? I have this room booked from 2 to 3.,Turns around and feigns surprise.
It's 2 o' clock.,"Oh well, we should go then. Ducklings are about to get up again. That just leaves cancer. Get a lung biopsy."
It took a half an hour to get a mask on the kid for the lung scan!,"Well I'm sorry, was there somewhere you needed to be?"
"House, can we talk?",Carpet?
Carpet? NEver.,Nothing to talk about.
Your girlfriend called the clinic 15 times looking for you today.,"Huh. A lot to discuss, Parkna patterns--"
"House, she's a stalker.","Right, couldn't be that she finds me interesting and attractive. Has to be that she's insane."
She's called you 15 times your mother's not that interested in you.,Well maybe I'd be better adjusted if she was.
I'm notifying security.,Is this about the carpet? Do you think I'll back off if you block all my fun?
You better not be having fun!,I'm having fun. I'm not having sex.
I'm not having sex. She's dangerous!,She's not dangerous.
She's not dangerous. She's pretty.,She's pretty.
Men are stupid.,I'm with you so far.
I'm notifying security.,"Oh, give her a break, she's not dangerous, she's..."
"Still, just to be safe, you mind? Wilson shakes his head.","For the love of god, can't somebody shut that kid up? Got people trying to work around here. To Wilson. Why don't you show him a teddy bear or something?"
Who are you?,Somebody you'll nEver send a gift to.
"This is doctor House, your son's doctor.",He picks up the gas mask.
What are you doing?,Eating the red berries.
He trusted you.,"No, that wasn't trust. That was self-preservation."
"No, that was huge. It was like a conversation.",Tries to get up and unsteadily hangs on to the overhanging lights.
That was sensitive.,You have pretty hair.
Hope is all those parents have going for them.,"No, hope is what's making them miserable."
Is it so wrong for them to want to have a normal Parkld? It's normal to want to be normal.,Spoken like a true circle queen.
So it's wrong to feel sorry for this little boy?,"Why would you feel sorry for someone who gets to opt out of the inane courteous formalities which are utterly meaningless, insincere and therefore degrading?"
Then what are they? Liver cells.,Wow. Liver cells under his arm. I wonder what he's got where his liver's supposed to be.
Wow. Liver cells under his arm. I wonder what he's got where his liver's supposed to be.,Anyone got a clue how liver cells got into the kid's armpit?
Anyone got a clue how liver cells got into the kid's armpit?,"Make yourself at home. So, think maybe Gray's Anatomy got it all wrong?"
But we're not talking about cancer cells.,"So what's the difference between cancer cells and liver cells, why can one pass through walls but the other can't?"
"Cancer cells are damaged lets them go into blood vessels, go wherEver they want.",So if the liver cells are damaged...
Liver isn't damaged. The tests were normal.,"So if the liver cells are damaged -- it's theoretically possible to pass into the lymphatic system. Liver failure could also explain pleural effusion, Even the heart issues."
"Liver cells are fine, he was immunized for Hep A and B and do you really think this kid is having unprotected sex or sharing needles?","Hmm, daddy does seem the type to use a rubber. So it's not viral. He gets up and starts pacing. Just leaves a lot of boozerosis."
"House, when we echoed his heart we got a piece of his liver, there was no scarring.","Cirrhosis explains the symptoms heart pRoblems, lungs."
Parents aren't doing or dosing this kid.,How would you know that? Kid can't talk. Why'd you think I took this case? He's not going to give away the ending.
They quit their jobs for him.,"Yes, they are Everything you'd want in a parent."
So you figure they slipped the kid a mickey so they don't have to deal.,"Do a biopsy to confirm cirrhosis and don't try and pawn it off on Wilson, he's going to be busy with Cuddy."
"Do a biopsy to confirm cirrhosis and don't try and pawn it off on Wilson, he's going to be busy with Cuddy.",My parents love me unconditionally. Get out of here.
Not doing it. She continues walking down leaving a disappointed Wilson.,Liver biopsy?
They're doing it now.,How's it going?
"Like a biopsy needles, cells, screaming.",What'd you find in the stool sample?
"You were too busy bothering Cuddy, as discussed it was negative for parasites. Can we get out of here?",I didn't ask what you didn't find I asked what you did find in the stool sample.
"Stool. And traces of iron, zinc, calcium carbonate, can we leave?",What's the matter? You afraid of the Man?
What's the matter? You afraid of the Man?,"Uh oh, too late."
Leave my stuff alone!,You're meeting with a Guggenheim in 15 minutes wearing that?
"I'm going to count to 3 and then, I'm going to fire you. One.","Calcium carbonate, that's uhh... antidiarrheal, right?"
"antidiarrheal, right? Two.",Think that's significant?
Thank god you don't have Parkldren. Doctor Cuddy.,Take a message.
Your Patient is being rushed to cardiac ICU.,"Wow, that's like the one thing that would get me out of here."
"He's stable for the moment, first degree atrioventricular block.","Okay, what else do we know?"
Biopsy was negative for cirrhosis. Parents didn't poison their son.,"It's not his liver, his heart or his lungs. The calcium carbonate in his stool."
"He's constipated, parents pRobably just overdid it.",Or they didn't do it at all. Calcium carbonate's also what's in chalk.
"So he ate some chalk, it isn't toxic, sure didn't cause the pleural effusion.",Forget the chalk.
You just said it was about the chalk.,"Yes, and then I said forget the chalk, you must be very confused. This kid's got pica. Take him to a buffet he's going to eat the table."
LEvel of lead in the blood was normal. His tox screen was clean.,"We're not looking for typical poisons we're looking for anything that he can put in his mouth matches, spiders, bricks."
Pressure-treated wood used to contain arsenic.,"Even better. To Foreman. Hansel, get samples of the gingerbread House bag Everything."
"Hansel, get samples of the gingerbread House bag Everything. Hey.",You can get into a lot of trouble being here.
I wanted to see you.,"Yeah, I got that. So did Everyone else, they think you're a stalker."
One could argue those people might be jealous of your attention.,Yes I actually made that argument.
You going home?,That's the plan.
In Iceland the age of consent is 14.,I'm surprised that tourism isn't a bigger industry up there.
So today I'm jailbait but in 22 weeks anybody can do anything to me. Will I be so different in 22 weeks?,22 weeks is enough for an embryo to grow arms and legs.
It's just a line an arbitrary line drawn by a bunch of sad old men in Robes.,"Yeah, who cares what Judges think."
Didn't think of you as a guy who followed rules just because they were rules.,You are over 10 years younger than me. Ali makes a face. I said over.
You are over 10 years younger than me. Ali makes a face. I said over.,Gotta go!
Gotta go! House.,"Doctor Cuddy, do you happen to know the way to the Icelandic consulate? This young Woman, a stranger to me, was just asking directions."
Security was going to call the police I don't want to do that to you. Go home.,She needed a ride.
"She got here on her own she can get home on her own. Now! Ali grudgingly gets off House's bike. And if I see you on hospital grounds again, I will call the police.","After that look I'm feeling a little frisky, looks like you're up."
"I'm ovulating, let's go.",The frisky it went away.
"House, this isn't a game.",If I leave her alone can I have my carpet back?
If I leave her alone can I have my carpet back? No.,If I forget about my carpet can I have her?
Meeting here will do nothing to upset Cuddy.,I'm not trying to upset Cuddy I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with the Patient. Continue.
Jimson weed doesn't explain the screaming.,You've obviously nEver had a bad trip.
I would have thought you'd try to accomplish two goals at once.,Why can't you be more like the other age inappropriate girls who have a thing for me? Just accept me for me. Continue.
He won't survive 3 days.,What time does he wake up?
What time does he wake up? 7.35am.,Then what? Walk me through it.
"7.40 - 7.50 he goes to the toilet, washes his face, what does this matter?",I'm trying to prove he ate the plant.
His schedule has nothing to do with Jimson weed.,"There are two possibilities, either the parents saw him eat the plant or the kid has unsupervised time and eats plants instead of playing blocks."
Even if you find 15 minutes of free time outside doesn't mean he spent it eating a bush.,So what do we do? Nothing? Wait for the kid to tell us? What?
Where are you going?,To talk to him.
To talk to him.,Ever see your son eat a bush?
I've only Ever seen him eat leftover--,Adam!
He can't answer you.,Neither can you.
He doesn't know what you want.,"Adam, you have to tell me because if you don't, He picks up the PSP and shows the game over screen on it. it'll be game over, you'll be dead."
What the hell are you doing?,Show me what you ate. Adam! Show me what you ate.
Adam? Honey? Adam!,"At the podium in the front of the room, talking in a spot-on Southern accent. Come on in, brothers and sister. Welcome to the House of the Lord!"
"House, come on, the chapel?",One of the strangers leaves.
"It's consistent with Jimson weed poisoning, ocular paralysis. The other stranger gets up to leave. Sorry.","The wicked shall deceive ye because they have turned from the Lord and are idiots, his ocular muscle didn't paralyze, it pirouetted."
"The wicked shall deceive ye because they have turned from the Lord and are idiots, his ocular muscle didn't paralyze, it pirouetted. MS.",It is easier for a wise Man to gain access to heaven!
"Stroke, bleed in the brain.","Back to his normal American accent. We'd be seeing other symptoms besides a single eye misalignment, like a coma, and you've already testified."
"It's a micro tumor. Started in his lung which caused the pleural effusion, then it metastasized to his liver which made it slough cells. And then went to his brain behind the eye which caused it to roll back into his head.",So he has 3 tumors and we missed all of them. What's the opposite of a miracle?
"I've a better chance of finding it now that I know exactly where to look. So, unless you have a better idea, I'm going to go CT his head and then if I have to, remove his eye.",You remove this kid's eye he's only going to be half as good at not making eye contact.
Hello? Hello? Hello? House finally looks up. I have sad news for you. She doesn't love you.,You're ugly when you're jealous.
"She showed up at my House last night, came on to me.",She's Even more perfect than I thought.
House! She's sick.,"You say sick, I say freestyling."
The girl will have sex with an invertebrate.,"Come on, you're not that bad."
She has a pRoblem. You're not doing her any favors by indulging her!,Why would you lie like this? Do you not have room in your heart for love?
You don't beliEve me.,I didn't beliEve the kids when they said that Suzie was sleeping with Johnny.
She has a mole on her right breast just below the nipple.,Softly. No she doesn't.
You've seen her breasts?!,"It was a medical exam. I was listening to her heart it went Greg House, Greg House, Greg House."
"Fine, I'm lying. But she did come back, she's locked up in my office, I was hoping you could talk to her, put an end to this.",Listen to me do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed with me?
You're only saying that to make me go.,I'm saying it 'coz it's true.
Starting to cry. What about us?,We'll always have Fresno.
Was there an earthquake when you were in Fresno? What?,I ask all my girlfriends that.
Umm... yeah a little one.,Damn.
What? What is it?,"It's not love, you have spore in your brain Coccidioides immitis."
"So loving you, wanting to have sex with you is all just the spores talking?",Hands her a prescription. You'll pRobably live. Damn!
Hands her a prescription. You'll pRobably live. Damn!,Hey! Don't touch his eye!
This is an appendectomy.,"Like I said, don't touch his eye."
"Like I said, don't touch his eye.",Why isn't he in surgery?
Some emergency bumped him we've got another room in 10 minutes.,"Better not take him in, kill the lights. He sits on Adam's bed. He's seeing them all the time."
What are you looking for?,Using a light to peer into Adam's pupil.
What are you talking about? What was he seeing?,Peers into the pupil again and now we can see the squiggly lines Adam was drawing...
Stool samples were negative for parasites.,Raccoon roundworms are not excreted by their huMan host.
Cameron tested the sand.,All of it?
"Wait a minute, that's it? He's going to be ok?","Good news, he's going to be with you for a long, long time."
"You're not autistic you don't Even have Asperger's. You wish you did, it would exempt you from the rules, give you freedom, absolve you of responsibility, let you date 17-yr-olds. But most important it would mean that you're not just a jerk.",At what point does a person endlessly lecturing someone make him a jerk?
You saved his life.,"Yeah I know, see ya."
20-yr-old married African-American female couldn't breathe. Anaphylaxis-like throat-swelling.,Parkldren?
You think pregnancy would explain the--,It explains the marriage. Who the hell gets married at 20?
I'm guessing people in love?,Show me a 20-yr-old who's not in love.
"Not allergies, negative on the skin test - 4 days of antihistamines and steroids.",Who's he talking to?
Who's he talking to? What?,"It's got an ass, technically that makes it a who."
Uhh... new nurse in Peds. Wendy something. Swelling just started to go down.,You seen her here before?
"I tried following her home, but she gave me the slip. Swelling's--","You think that's funny, ask him about the time he sabotaged my cane."
"There was a point to it. Wendy, this is House.",Something about not getting too uppity with normal folks who walk good.
grimaces at House Why so rude?,"You sprinted through 3 bad marriages, into an affair with a dying Patient - now a naughty nurse?"
It's amazing how you can not only know it's a relationship but that it's a bad relationship based on nothing but... nothing.,I know you.
"I'm not with her, not Even trying.","You're lying to me, that's interesting."
"walking towards his office Well, as long as it's interesting. Swelling is--",Why is she hanging out here?
Anyone interesting in what happened with the swelling?,"She's in Peds, it's the next wing over."
"Clearly he did and Wilson denied it, and House doesn't beliEve him. It's gotta hurt, that's why it pays to have more than one friend, House.",If he's not hitting that then why's she here?
"Because I'm hitting that and it's totally hot. House, Chase and Foreman look at her shocked for a moment Swelling took 4 days to resolve, Patient has unexplained intensive abdominal pains.",So explain them. Wake me when they've done an exploratory laparotomy. Anybody know her? Know her story?
"Up an' at 'em. she spreads the case file on the table in front of House They did a laparotomy. Liver, bowel, gall bladder, appendix all clean.",Belly pain plus throat swelling.
"Sorry, take it back, that's a stretch.",Got a better idea? Silence Then stretch away. Start her on floroquinolone for the salmonella.
I was waiting 2 hours out there. He puts a piece of gum in his mouth and House closes the door,Fascinating. Have you considered a career as a memoirist? He sits down on the stool Let's see it.
You don't introduce yourself? He starts unzipping his pants,"Sorry, I thought you were waiting 2 hours, didn't know you wanted to chat."
How can you tell--,You want me to touch you? It's your private place. You're chewing nicotine gum which causes dehydration which causes wear and tear. Try a lubricant or foreplay if you're cheap.
"Just take a swab and get it tested, ok?","Sorry, already met this month's quota of useless tests for stubborn idiots. He pops a vicodin"
He pops a vicodin You're rude.,"Wow, you're like a... detective or something."
"And you're smart, and you're funny but you are bitter. He starts pulling up his pants And you're lonely, so you treat Everyone around like they're idiots and you get away with it because of your cane.","Please stop, it's hard to write through the haze of bitter tears."
"But you're not actually getting away with it. Last nurse you made fun of, she pRobably slipped some crap into your coffee.","Nyeah, I asked for decrappinated coffee."
"Treat people like jerks, you get treated like a jerk. Thank you.",Bend over. Tritter smiles like it's a joke
You're kidding me.,"If you have an infection, you'd have a fEver."
"If you have an infection, you'd have a fEver. You're chewing nicotine gum which messes with the weather in your mouth so I need to he shows the thermometer vacation elsewhere.","And wait 'til I put the thermometer in. Tritter tries to look back to see what House is doing Uh uh, you break it, you bought it."
"And wait 'til I put the thermometer in. Tritter tries to look back to see what House is doing Uh uh, you break it, you bought it.",Leaving early today.
We should switch her to a different antibiotic.,Why?
We can't treat the salmonella unless--,Salmonella? That was a total stretch.
"Man, why does that sound so familiar? You think it's 'coz I said it an hour ago?","Then it was a dumb thing to say, now it's smart."
Stick test was negative for peanuts.,That's because you foolishly tested her while she was lying down.
"Exercise-based anaphylaxis? Think that requires exercise. When her throat closed they'd just got done eating, not Even competitive eating.",And getting Robbed. Always gets my heart rate up. Give her the same food she ate at the diner and stick her on the treadmill.
"Better yet put a gun to her head, threaten to rape her.",You don't think I'm going to get a response?
You don't think I'm going to get a response? No.,"You're on, 50 bucks."
I'm not betting on a Patient's--,A hundred bucks? If you say so. He walks into a room and Chase and Foreman exchange a look before walking off together
"He's as sick as she is, now.",Told you it would work.
It worked on the wrong Patient.,We can spend all day arguing right and wrong. Give me the hundred bucks.
We didn't bet!,We could spend all day arguing whether we bet or not. Give me the hundred bucks.
"pays up as they enter the locker room Husband's test showed no MI. No aortic dissection. It's not his heart, it's just nonspecific chest and abdominal pain.","So, psychosomatic? Panic attack? House takes Cameron's stethoscope and begins to break into a locker."
Pain persisted after he got Lorazepam and morphine. Whose locker is that?,"Mine. Chest, stomach, throat. What does it all mean?"
We're in the nurses' locker room!,"I know that. The locker opens. Oh, that is so annoying! Wilson's girlfriend's left her stuff in my locker again."
"Great, I hadn't committed any felonies yet today.","Relax, you know they're going to blame!"
"House, you wanna mess with Wilson, no pRoblem. But you've got no reason to screw around with",Can we get back to the medicine?
"Okay. Why assume one disease? His chest, her throat.",So it's just a coincidence that they both got crippling stomach pains.
It means you're insane! Wilson's not dating her.,You feeling luckier?
It doesn't matter what I answer?,Two hundred it is.
"If they're married and caught the same disease, then it means they",Aha! Brochure to a jazz festival in the Poconos this weekend.
"Wilson likes jazz. Foreman, pay the Man.","Four, five, six novels, no music. What does that mean?"
What does that mean? She's literate.,"It means she spends her time reading, not listening."
"Married couple. Same disease. They either got it from each other, or in the same place.",Infectious or environmental.
Good. Then I'm sure you'll have no pRoblem convincing House.,That cheating bastard!
He loves her!,"Right, I bet he told you that she's the love of his life."
"People lie, I get it, but they don't go up against two armed gunmen to save someone unless",There's a reason that we don't let kids vote or drink or work in the salt mines.
"Gonorrhea explains all their symptoms. Fitz-Hugh Curtis syndrome for her belly pain, Costochondritis and bladder infection for his chest and abdominal pain.","Good. Now go rub their lying, cheating privates with a cotton swab."
"No scarring, no purulent discharge, and the NATs were negative. They don't have an STD.","What's that, you say? You have a pRoblem with interracial couples?"
"Thank you, Chase.",No! Haven't any of your shorties Ever been whities?
"Not sure I understand your ghetto slang, Dr. House. How Many black women have you dated, by the way?",I don't care about color. As long as they can help me breed a superior race.
"Yeah, my exes have usually been black, so what? It's not a racial thing, it's cultural. I have more in common with them, like I assume you only date emotionally stunted bigots.","Sorry, you're right. That kind of prejudice is totally fine."
The abdominal pain's getting worse. We've had to up their morphine twice.,"Take the wife off the steroids. If she spikes a fEver, we'll know it's an infection. If she doesn't, it's environmental."
"Take the wife off the steroids. If she spikes a fEver, we'll know it's an infection. If she doesn't, it's environmental.",He got off easy. I almost gave him a colonoscopy.
"That was one of the stupidest things you have Ever done, and there is heavy competition for House is rifling around in something. What are you doing?","Hmm, only ate half your breakfast. Feeling a little sick this morning?"
"I'm not pregnant, they burnt my omelet. You need to apologize to this guy.",I'm a Man of principle. I don't care how much time and money it costs you to defend me.
He wants to kill you.,No empty coffee cups. Off the caffeine. Good for baby.
"Cup's in the other wastebasket, baby's in your mind! You can berate Patients all you want. Shoving objects into their rectums is assault. Pay attention to me.","Sorry, that would make it harder to ignore you. Can't ignore that rapidly expanding first trimester ass, though."
Or tumors or anything.,"You add brain involvement to the chest, stomach, throat, what've you got?"
"Didn't spike a fEver when we took her off the steroids, so it's not an infection.",Leaving environmental. What flavor?
"Environmental doesn't make sense, either. If it were toxin, we'd see it in their livers. None of their neighbors are sick, no coworkers","They both got it, meaning it's infection or environmental, and since it's not an infection!"
What if they didn't both get it? Maybe we got our basic assumption wrong and it's two different diseases?,Maybe we didn't and it's sarcoidosis.
Sarcoidosis isn't infectious or environmental.,Tell that to the clusters of sarcoidosis cases.
I did see these two putting out that blaze in the Pine Barrens.,"If sarcoidosis has two environmental causes, it has environmental causes."
It doesn't explain his throat swelling.,That's what 'almost' means.
90% of sarcoidosis cases have lung scarring.,"Oh, 90%?"
"Oh, 90%? Oh, almost.","Fine, I'll consult a specialist. He climbs over the balcony wall and into Wilson's office."
If this is more dating advice!,"Love to gossip, but I've got work to do. Is this sarcoidosis?"
"It's pretty nonspecific. Could be granulomas, could be plaques. What's this? Oh, oh, you stole Wendy's personnel file?!","In a way, aren't we all guilty of bribing the janitor of taking the file and giving it to me?"
"First of all, I am not dating her.","She is so wrong for you. You know, she filed a form so the hospital would take extra withholding. Who does that?"
"She's much too cautious for me. Point taken, I'll start dating her so I can break up with her and start dating a stripper. You're a miserable jerk who can't stand to be alone.",I didn't try to break up your marriages you did that yourself.
My marriages were so crappy I was spending all my time with you. Your real fear is me having a good relationship.,"Yes, that keeps me up at night."
You don't! no. I don't think it's sarcoidosis. House walks back.,He says it's sarcoidosis. Start them both on methotrexate.
And if you're wrong?,If Wilson's wrong. We'll biopsy her just to be sure.
"The brain stem? Brain damage is not only possible, it's likely!","Good point. Let's biopsy something safer, like her shoes."
"The husband, he'd have to give consent. He can't right now.",Why? This guy write with his stomach?
"He has a conflict of interest. It's not his brain we're cutting open, but he's getting all the benefit. He'd do it just to save himself.","Or to save her. She's the love of his life, remember?"
She needs a guardian ad litem. I can't let you do this.,How're you going to stop me? Call Cuddy?
"Cameron's right, there's a conflict.","No, there isn't! Not unless one of them wants to die a horrible, painful death."
I'm sure the guardian will figure that out.,In a couple days! Will the guardian convince the disease to hold off eating her brain until we can get the legalities worked out?
"I just don't want some plaintiff's Lawyer owning my hospital. Legalities help. Speaking of which, did you get your thermometer back yet?","Uh, we had a nice chat. Did you know he's a Rotarian? Listen, she'll die without the biopsy."
"I need to cover the hospital's ass. You're too biased. I send you in there, you'll steamroll over him. Something goes wrong, he'll sue us for not disclosing the risks.","Then have Wilson talk to the husband. Wilson kills people left and right, no one Ever sues him."
"Fine, but only if you apologize to the clinic guy.","Nah, pRobably better to just let that couple die."
Then stop treating me.,Great job. Why don't you just shoot him in the head?
"Hold on, that gives me an idea. You know what could save this couple, lots of misdirected sarcasm.",They're dead. Yelling at you might prEvent you from screwing up like this --
I didn't screw up. I did my job!,Your job was to get me the biopsy.
"No, it was to present the Patient with his options.","Two options biopsy or no biopsy. He chose the third, no treatment. How do you Even do that?"
Remember when you used to just weave elaborate conspiracy theories about my love life? Those were such good times.,How much morphine is the husband on?
"We can't increase it any more, his respirations are depressed.","Decrease it! Drugs cloud people's Judgement. Cold turkey, you sucker."
"Cold turkey, you sucker. Uh, no.",Good point.
"Uh, no. Good point.",Did I ask you guys to follow me?
"No, which made us nervous.",They'll catch on if they notice that he's off the morphine drip. Shoot him up with one of these puppies instead.
Shoot him up with one of these puppies instead. No!,You do understand it's not really a puppy.
"An opiate blocker? It'll feel like he's swallowing a bonfire. That's pretty unethical, Even for you.",How is that unethical? It'll lead to a diagnosis!
It's leading to the torture of the husband on the off chance he'll allow a procedure on another person!,"Which will lead to a diagnosis, didn't I just say that?"
"Give it up. Foreman and Cameron are too ethical, and I'm too scared of getting sued.","Fine. Now I'm just going to find someplace safe to hide this, where I won't be tempted to use it."
"You're not doing it, either. What, you're gonna run for it?","If they die now, they'll nEver be able to grow old and tired of each other. He hands the meds to Foreman and leaves."
That's actually pretty clEver.,"Guess I can't use that trick again, huh? Foreman tries to open the cart, but it's all locked up."
"Oh! Ow, my stomach, ow!","It's a pretty smart plan, Jerry, but I'm on to you."
"You poisoned your wife, and don't want the coppers to get wise. No!",Oh. Then you're just a moron!
Then you're just a moron! Biopsy me!,"Only if this thing hits your brain, you moron! I can't stress that moron thing enough. You're killing your wife!"
She is the love of my life!,Careful.
"No, it won't. The morphine just isn't working right now for some reason. I'm putting you on a tranquilizer in the mean time. It'll work again soon.",Wanna bet?
"I don't care about the pain. I need to be in pain, so I can get worse. That means you can do the biopsy on me!","Dude, she's in a coma. Who're you trying to impress?"
I was just going to call you.,I need a court order to biopsy this Woman's brain.
I don't want to sue you.,Good.
I want to beat the crap out of you.,Less good.
"I'll tell you why. You're a bully. And bullies, they don't back down until they run into someone stronger and meaner.",But you'll accept an apology.
But you'll accept an apology. Yes.,Not really a recipe for sincerity.
I'm not looking for sincerity. I'm looking for humiliation. Something that will make you think twice before you treat the next Patient like crap.,"Here's what's gonna happen you go brag to your friends about how you made the big, nasty doctor go poop in his pants, I get Cuddy off my back by telling her I humiliated myself, here's the catch we're both gonna be lying."
What's wrong? Jeremy's worse.,Then that's what's right. You cut the stubborn jerk's head open and take a slice.
This isn't sarcoidosis.,"He'll get his wish. He's dying, just not in a way that's going to help his wife."
He's got ischemic bowel.,So what?
"Well, let's see. Lack of blood flow's causing his guts to die, which will cause him to die unless we cut out a few feet of small intestine and reattach the ends. I don't know, seems like a match.",Why does he have it? What does it tell us?
Small cell vasculitis?,"Good. Now, let's hear it again, but now with a more environmental or infectious feeling."
"Or, like I said before, it might not be environmental or infectious. He has vasculitis, she has porphyria. Belly pain plus hallucinations, classic symptoms. Can Even cause a coma.",Fine. Start her on hematin for porphyria.
What about him?,"Take out the dead bowel, it's all we can do. And biopsy it. If Foreman's right, it might save him. If Foreman's wrong, it might save both of them."
The bowel's not dead.,"Unless he's been tossing down cans of frosty lactic acid, the bowel is dead. What we're looking for is a reason it's dead."
The bowel's not dead. Just general swelling and edema. The high lactate was pRobably from stress. We just sliced him open from chest to pubic bone for nothing.,Nothing's something. Forget the isochemia. Add the edema and swelling.
PRobably from cutting him open.,"PRobably, not definitely. Okay, back to the beginning. What did we talk about? Anything, I want to hear it all again."
He wasn't cheating on her.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Love of his life. Don't you have to wait 'till he's dead to make that determination?"
She's his only girlfriend Ever. They grew up next door. They ran off together as teenagers. Sarcoidosis. We only ruled it out because we thought he had isochemic,Why did they run off?
What difference does it,"Kids talk about running off, not Many do it. What was the reason?"
"They were trying to escape his evil, pill-popping, racist dad. You would have liked him. We should do another biopsy.",How'd you know the dad was racist?
He beat up his son for dating a black girl. Extrapolated from that,You see racism Everywhere. Maybe he just didn't like this black girl.
It's not sarcoid. We would have seen granulomas in,"She has pretty eyes. Forget infectious. Forget environmental. Defective DNA is keeping them from making a critical protein, hence the fluid build-up. Hits the throat, stomach, chest, and brain."
"Hits the throat, stomach, chest, and brain. Angioedema?",Hereditary Angioedema. Symptoms fit perfectly.
It's an incredibly rare disease. They would both have to have a parent,"Is it a coincidence that your sister has great hair, or that these two have green eyes?"
You're not saying! they're not brother and sister?,"Ew, God, no!"
You won't know for sure,Test them for HAE or paternity. It's going to take a day. She doesn't have a day. Start treating and see what happens.
"Tracy, Tracy, she's awake. Oh God, baby, it's going to be okay.","Awesome, can I tell them?"
"We've obviously got to let them know what's wrong, but the cause, the brother-sister thing!","Good plan. You've just got to keep them away from doctors, the internet, and anyone who's not a total moron."
Yesterday he was willing to die to save her. You've got to give him time to recover,He might be a little vexed that you kept letting him hump his sister in the mean time.
"Unless their dad was also the product of an incestuous union, the chances of serious complications are minimal.","Noble of you to take that risk. Tell them, or I will."
I'm going out of town.,"Where are you going? no answer Foreman, you're not missing a blue shoe, are you? Com you can't bet when you know the answer beforehand!"
We can spend all day arguing whether you can bet when you know the answer beforehand. Give me the two hundred bucks.,"What? Foreman leaves, and meets up with Wendy in the hallway."
She just needs some time alone. You want me to hang out here a bit? Jeremy nods tearfully.,"If you've come to return the thermometer, don't bother. I've moved on."
"If you'd actually read my chart, you'd know that I'm a cop. You were going 40 in a 25 zone.","Oh, come on. This isn't because I was speeding, it's because I'm Latino."
"License, registration, proof of insurance.","Sorry, cool jacket. Only pockets for important stuff."
That's a shame.,"50 buck ticket. Is that your way of beating me up, or is that the price for sticking something in you?"
"You took a pill while examining a Patient, that's serious addictive behavior. I'm betting that you're holding right now.","I wasn't weaving, I'm not drunk, you've got no reason to"
"Pupils dilated, appear to be under the influence of a narcotic. Would you mind turning around, please, and putting your hands behind your head?",Does that polite crap Ever work on people? Tritter grabs him and does the above for him.
Most people realize that there's only one answer. He reaches into a pocket and finds some Vicodin. Got a prescription?,I'm a cripple who works in a hospital. You don't think I've got a valid prescription?
"Have my baby, what a lovely way to say how much you love me...",Excusez-moi garon!
I think you mean Barney Fife.,So Many great idiot icons to choose from.
You need time to think of some more?,Either arraign me or let me go.
"No pRoblem, which do you prefer?",What took you so long?
"Sorry, I didn't have 15 grand in my loose change jar. What the hell did you do? He takes a bottle of vicodin out of his pocket and hands it to House.",Nothing. He takes a vicodin.
"The motorcycle was impounded, that explains the speeding, DUI and driving without a license. The fact that you're you explains the illegal possession of narcotics and resisting arrest.",Where's your car?
Where's your car? What happened?!,Some idiot cop with crotch rot obviously thought that I didn't treat him with the deference due to a Man of his stature.
Does Cuddy know?,I don't think she needs to. Wilson looks at him and he shrugs. I'm innocent!
Til proven guilty.,"The guy wanted to punish me, he did it. It's over."
Better get yourself a Lawyer.,I already got one.
You know what they say about the Lawyer who has himself as a client?,Same thing they say about the doctor who lends 15 grand to a friend he knows can't pay him back.
"But I have seen how Many pills he's been popping lately, I wouldn't be surprised if he's in a coma somewhere himself.","If I am, this is one lame hallucination."
What happened to you?,"If you Ever end up in a bar with a Cambridge Woman's heavyweight eight, do not accept the offer of an upside-down kamikaze shot."
We have a case.,"Fat guy in a coma, I know."
Cuddy found you?,"Nope, but the wall between Wilson's office and this one is thinner than you think which means we need to stop talking about what a pathetic loser he is."
CO2 and oxygen stats are normal.,"For you and me, what's normal for a hippopotamus? Cameron gives him a look, Foreman looks annoyed. Get a detailed medical history."
And I doubt a guy who weighs 600 pounds bothers with annual physicals.,"Talk to the neighbors, search the House."
"It's usually worse in the morning. Especially if I've slept on my arm. He's massaging his shoulder as he talks to House. If I sleep on my back or you know, with my arms out, I'm usually ok.",So your arm only hurts after you lie on top of it all night.
So your arm only hurts after you lie on top of it all night. Yeah.,"Hmm. Well have you thought about, I don't know, not doing that?"
"Yeah, but it's how I sleep. It's how I've always slept.",Well there's always surgery.
To do what? Like clean out some cartilage or something?,You're not sleeping on some cartilage you're sleeping on your arm.
You wanna remove my arm?,"Well it is your left, a guy's gotta sleep."
I see spending a night in jail hasn't humbled you a bit.,"While following my Every move is flattering, a single rose on my doorstep each morning would be more enticing."
Just bringing your boss up to speed which I guess you didn't feel was necessary. He takes out some more gum and puts it in his mouth.,You going to add that to my list of charges? He takes out a vicodin and swallows it.
People who are innocent tend not to try to hide their arrest.,Is that based on your years of experience arresting innocent people?
Foreman and Cameron walk in to find House. Who's that?,Apparently Cuddy's widened her sperm donor search to include Neanderthals.
Cuddy's looking for a sperm donor?,"It's a joke. Like Cuddy would Ever want a kid. Or a kid would Ever want Cuddy. Hello, that's why it's funny! Why are you guys here?"
It's not Pickwick's. Intubation and steroids have had no effect. Except maybe to cause whatEver it is to get worse he's got a fEver now.,He turns to Cameron. What'd you find out?
That you and George have the same taste in home furnishings and women.,Danish modern and Russian gymnasts?
"Pianos and prostitutes. We should do an LP, look for neurosyphilis.",It's not syphilis.
How do you know?,Because you get STDs from people you trust.
Weight limit on the MRI maParkne is 450 pounds.,So do a CT.
So do a CT. Limit's 350.,Then just start treatment.
We give him blood thinners and the coma's caused by a bleed instead of a clot we'd kill him.,Either start treatment or start building a stronger MRI.
Here. She hands him a piece of paper.,What's this?
Shifting House's feet so she can sit down next to them. I made some calls for you. The guy's the best criminal attorney in Princeton.,Thanks but I don't need it. I assume you told Inspector Clouseau that I have a valid prescription for the vicodin?
"Yeah, and I assume you did as well did it make a difference? The guy's pissed, and with the DEA now treating pain doctors like Columbian--","I'm not a pain doctor, I'm a pain Patient."
"It was pRobably just some sort of head trauma and we missed the swelling because, well, his head's already swollen.",Bump on the noggin doesn't explain the fEver.
We just replaced the last MRI you broke.,Referring to the fund-raising funbags by the royal 'We' now?
Let me explain cause and effect to you.,I specifically told them to skip the boring testing part and jump right to the dangerous treatment.
He's telling the truth. Everyone looks up at Cameron.,Shrugs. Kids these days - got no respect for other people's property.
This was your idea? Yeah.,Looks like Cameron is going to be having a lot more ideas in future. Who knew that being bloated and bitchy could actually come in handy?
"We should do nothing. Just keep him a couple of days for observation, if he doesn't get any worse it was pRobably just a hematoma that dissipated on its own.",Or we do all of the above.
"And now that you have, when can I go?","It's pRobably her mom, I bet she's huge. She's from the Midwest. Looks at the salad. Since when did you eat beets?"
"Since I was 5? And who are we talking about? You know, just in case you need me to Parkme in and tell you you're a lunatic at some point.",Picks a cherry tomato from the salad and pops it into his mouth.
Yeah you definitely better get to the bottom of that. I heard Cuddy gave you the name of a Lawyer.,"Or it could just be pity, she feels guilty about being born beautiful so she overcompensates by being nice to ugly people."
"From what I hear the Patient reminds her of you, not me. Call the Lawyer.",Cameron sees a clump of dirt and she thinks of me.
"Or a lump of something else, you're a lunatic, call the Lawyer. Very mature.",You started it.
"Skin exam and ACTH stimulation test were both normal. He has nystagmus, but it's congenital no way it's related to the coma. He hands House a sheet of the results.","You say no way I say! yeah, no way."
"Blood and urine were negative for ChlAmydia, Herpes and Syphilis.",In his Southern accent. Looks like we got ourselves a mystery.
"Not for long, he wants to be discharged.","Oh sure. Places to go, people to eat."
He insisted chance of dying from hospital acquired infection is greater than him dying from whatEver caused his coma.,Did you tell him that statistics also say he's a big fat idiot?
Selectively rational? Stubborn? Uncooperative? Maybe you ought to check his leg.,Bursts out in sudden mocking laughter.
"Bursts out in sudden mocking laughter. You see what he did there? The Patient's like me, the Patient's three me's. If I were him-- House suddenly gets a thoughtful look. Maybe it's not such a mystery after all.",Enjoying your Salisbury steak?
Putting chopped parsley on a hamburger does not a Salisbury steak make. You must be doctor House.,And you must be full of baloney. A lot of it.
"Laughs. Right, fat joke, always fun. Only people you can still make fun of.",And Christians.
"You figure, I'm fat therefore I hate myself.",That's a huge leap of logic.
I don't wanna die I just don't wanna be here.,Then it's a condition you've already had diagnosed or it's something you know you've inherited.
My parents are both alive and well and living in Boca Raton.,Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis?
I have no idea what that is.,Leukoencephalopathy?
"Angrily throws his cutlery onto the tray. Will you stop? If I knew what was wrong, I would tell you. I'm not an imbecile, and I'm not miserable. I'm just overweight.","Mobile rings, he picks up. What? When? He puts it down. To be continued."
"Mobile rings, he picks up. What? When? He puts it down. To be continued.",What are you doing here?
"When you err! when you got bailed out, before we could get a Judge to approve this He holds up a search warrant and takes the evidence bag. I almost didn't bother. I thought for sure you'd come straight home and throw Everything out. Rookie mistake nEver underestimate the stupidity of an addict. There's got to be over 600 vicodin in here which most DA's would say proves intent to traffic. Even if all you'd really intended was simply to be wasted 24/7 while practicing medicine.","In case you hadn't noticed, those are prescription bottles."
Shakes the evidence bag and listens to the pills rattle in the bottles. All these were legally prescribed to a Man who's in constant pain but nEver misses a day at work?,Ever occurred to you that's why I don't miss a day?
"Now maybe just a few of these are in someone else's name. Forged prescription. Just swiped from the pharmacy when nobody's looking. He steps closer to House with a smug expression on his face. You wouldn't do that, right?",Send him home.
"Why, you think he's healthy?","Either I'm right and he knows what's wrong, he's just too stubborn to admit it or I was right and it's Pickwick's. Treatment just had a delayed effect."
You don't have delayed effects to oxygen. And Pickwick's doesn't explain the fEver.,Being engulfed in an electric blanket of blubber could explain the fEver.
"Yesterday you insisted on keeping him here because of the fEver, we have no idea what's wrong with the guy. For all we know he could be dead in 12 hours.","He does not want our help, which means he doesn't want your help."
He's obviously just rationalizing and so are you! You would nEver give up this easy if you weren't so busy dealing with your own personal pRoblems.,Finally spots Wilson at the vending maParknes. Send him home. Turns away and approaches Wilson. What'd you tell that cop?
What'd you tell that cop? Nothing.,Nothing as in nothing or as in nothing to cause him to think that I have a stash in my apartment?
"He called to see if I prescribed the pills, I said yes, that's all.",Obviously not.
Obviously not. What happened?,"He searched my House, found a butt load of pills. Wilson sighs. A guy's gotta be prepared for a rainy day."
Last I checked pharmacies are still open when it rained.,And because I nEver know when you're going to be in one of your moods and cut me off.
"Oh, it's my fault.",I'm not the one who talked to the cop.
Disorientation and loss of balance could mean a neurofibromatosis.,Where's Chase?
Dunno. Haven't seen him since you told him to sit on his ass yesterday.,Interesting. NF-2 is also inherited which means I was right.
Kept saying it was Pickwick's.,"Between the first Pickwick's and the second Pickwick's, I said it was inherited. Brenda is coming out of George's room and House rather abruptly grabs the Patient file from her."
"No, he's not.",We have a rather large piece of tempered glass that begs to differ.
I tried to keep him in the wheelchair but he's tough to stop.,"Nice audible, Peyton."
So what do we do now?,Discharge report says he didn't eat his breakfast.
It can't be Chagas' he's nEver been outside the country.,"But his stomach has, the food we eat no longer comes from America's heartland, it comes from South America's deforested jungle land where lettuce now grows and lettuce pickers now poop."
How are we going to do that? He's too big to do an LP.,So go straight to the source.
And not surprisingly there was no sign of Chagas or any other parasites in his CSF.,"So we've ruled out his parents, prostitutes, the arugula - means either--"
"I took the sample from the pre-frontal, I was nEver anywhere near his visual cortex.",Or you missed a tumor on the MRI.
"Not a chance, the MRI was clean.",House finally seems to have found his wallet. Mind? Foreman steps out of his way.
Where are you going?,To get a 400 dollar butt plug.
What about George?,He's going to have to get his own. Come on let's see if we can get this thing figured out by the time we get to the elevator.
It could also explain his lack of concern for his health. MS can cause excessive cheerfulness.,"Yeah, he's a delight."
"No, blood sugar and urine dipstick and hemoglobin A1C are normal.",Were normal when you tested it.
We already have a CSF sample we might as well check it for proteins and rule out MS first.,Steps in and pushes the button for the floor he wants. Agreed except for the part about doing it first.
Stopping the doors from closing. Where are you going?,The butt plug was my way of saying mind your own business apparently too subtle.
"Speeding. House taps a gavel on a spot below his knee to induce a reflex knee jerk. DUI. House continues tapping after Every charge is read out. Reckless driving, resisting arrest, possession of a class 3 narcotic and now it looks like they've added another possession with intent to traffic charge as well. They found some pills at your House.",All of which I had a prescription for.
That's a lot of pills.,"I'm in a lot of pain. This is all because some cop came into the clinic, I was rude to him. This is his way of getting back at me."
You've made it pretty easy.,"His insane reaction to a simple rectal thermometer reading, He gets a chuckle out of the Lawyer. pRobably says a lot more about his mother than it says about me."
I'm inclined to think your particular charm may not be immediately appreciated by a jury.,I'm not interested in a plea bargain.
It's your best bet to make this go away.,"There is no this, there's a him the only thing I'm guilty of is humiliating a bully."
"What did your Lawyer say? House looks surprised. I looked up butt plug in a legal dictionary, what'd he say?",That a smile like mine can't lose. He then pulls a funny face and flashes it at both of them. What did the test say?
"You're right about MS, no myelin basic proteins in his CSF.",What about diabetes?
"Don't know, says we think only think it's diabetes because of his weight, won't let us test him.","So, you would rather be a blind invalid than admit the fact that maybe you might have a little pRoblem with overeating?"
And you would rather let me die than consider the fact that whatEver is wrong with me has nothing to do with my weight.,I go where the symptoms tell me to go.
I am not diabetic!,Grocery stores giving away medical degrees with the free turkeys now?
Pushes House away. Get the hell off of me!,No dessert 'til you've finished your dinner.
What the hell is going on? She rushes in but is stopped by Foreman from interfering.,Just trying to force a horse to-- He suddenly notices something about George's grip and lets go.
What's going on?,"Get x-rays of his hands, then bronc him do a sputum cytology and check his CSF for anti-Hu antibodies."
How are we going to get him to do all that when we can't Even get him to drink a bottle of sugar water?,Tell him that lung cancer is in no way connected to obesity.
Err... you don't think he'll realize we're lying?,We're not lung cancer's got nothing to do with--
I meant about him having lung cancer.,You didn't notice his fingers?
Shrugs. I noticed they were fat?,"Should have pissed him off. He would have grabbed you and you would have felt the bones, they're not just fat, they're clubbed."
You were right.,So was he.
"He said, c'est la vie. She walks into the room and starts playing with the BOUO ball of unknown origins - the oversized tennis ball.",He's a compliCated Man.
What about you? What are you going to do about your pRoblem?,Nothing.
I guess that's good.,You guess?
"No, it's good. You get to keep going like you always have.","Alright, I give up, who was it? Who in your family had the weight pRoblem?"
You think I can only care about a Patient if I know someone else who's been through the same thing?,You care for Everybody. You only lie and stand up to Cuddy for a few.
You lie for Everybody and only care about a few.,You're avoiding the question.
"I like damaged people, remember? Explains Everything I do.","Almost Everything. Cameron grins. Wasn't you, was it?"
Does it matter?,"Nope, but it'd be interesting."
What're you doing down here? Thought you usually have lunch with Coma Guy.,"Mouth full, wiping his hands. This is Vegetative-state Guy. Better company. To Gabe. Hey, hey, tell him about those Sherpa's you dropped acid with in St. Patrick's Cathedral."
"Upset, loud. You stole my prescription pad and you forged my name!","Beat, then serious. What'd you tell the cop?"
I lied! He'd have put you away for ten years after they took your license to practice medicine.,"Shrugs. So, Everything's good then."
Gesturing wildly. I lied! To the cops!,There is no case unless they can prove that either I got the drugs illegally or I sold them illegally.
"Yeah, Tritter's just playing. He's gonna see how clEver you are and then just walk away.",Important thing is you keep prescribing the same amount of drugs to me. Or it'll look suspicious.
What're you doing?,Nothing. What're you doing?
Nothing. What're you doing?,Parkps?
What're you doing? Parkps?,Wanna see something really cool?
Wanna see something really cool?,I saw you leaving last Tuesday practically tripped over two guys on your way out.
"I saw you leaving last Tuesday practically tripped over two guys on your way out. But you had no pRoblem opening doors. It's called Akinetopsia. You can't see things when they move. And since you haven't been hit by a bus, I assume it's intermittent. PRobably accompanied by seizures, which made me think that I can set one off by flashing a...","God, I love this family!"
He didn't report being an alcoholic either. Drinking equals falling down equals trauma equals...,Maybe it's inherited.
How did you jump to genetics? Coming over to look at the papers. From his EEG? All you got are some vaguely epileptiform waves.,"It's not his EEG. It's his father's. When it comes to cortical seizures, like father, like son."
Small seizures aren't unheard of in a Patient in a vegetative state.,Similarities are interesting though.
What caused the vegetative state?,"His House burned down went back in to get his wife. Firefighters found him unconscious three feet from the bedroom, asphyxiated."
Not an inherited condition.,Test his DNA. Start with adrenomyeloneuropathy.
Test his DNA. Start with adrenomyeloneuropathy.,Over his shoulder. Check out the home.
MRI and LP are both inconclusive. Infection's still possible. Tumor's less likely than...,DNA?
Adrenomyeloneuropathy test was negative.,DNA test again. Try Unverricht-Lundborg and late-onset Lafora's.
Protesting. Genetic tests take forEver. You can't just keep testing him for Every inherited condition you think it might be.,"Well, not me. I'll be leaving early. But you guys can."
He's unconscious and heading for a coma. He's at a four on the RLAS scale.,Stop all treatment.
To see if this is a reaction to our meds?,"Well, they obviously aren't helping."
"We take him off those meds, what do we put him on?",I was hoping you'd know.
Or neurological or...,Genetic.
Or neurological or... Genetic.,We need a better history.
You're not waking Kyle. You're waking his father.,I commend your observational skills.
You have no reason to think any Manner of drugs will wake a Man from a coma.,Correcting.
The amount of amphetamines alone will be dangerous. Besides whatEver the hell else you got in there.,There are reports out of South Africa about a pill that'd temporarily revive someone in a vegetative state. We've all seen Awakenings. It made me cry. I wanna cry.
"Voice-only, pissed off. Put the syringe down.","drawling I can out draw you, mysterious stranger."
Mad as heck. We don't experiment on helpless Patients!,Be reasonable. There's no way this is gonna work.
"Even if you woke him, it would only be for a few hours! A day! Two at the most! You're risking his life!",I'm risking getting sued. That's the only objection here.
You'll be torturing him and his family.,Good news for Legal. Only family he's got is upstairs dying.
Good news for Legal. Only family he's got is upstairs dying.,Whooaaaaaii!
"I had a paramedic ask me something similar after getting knocked out during a sporting Event, my response was numbers.",Smiling. Coolest thing Ever. Any history of seizure in your family?
Any history of seizure in your family? No.,Liver disease?
"No. To Cuddy. How long have I been here? Got the feeling it's uh, been a long time.",Interesting.
"Interesting. Your internal clock kept ticking. How deep does that awareness go? Pick up scraps of conversations, do you have a vague sense that the hospital administrator dresses like a trollop?",Or that the new Star Wars movies were a disappointment?
I knew I didn't make it. Sorry.,How 'bout your wife's side of the family? Any history of seizures there?
Ahh! Rumor in the cafeteria was Caustic Guy was waking up Coma Guy.,"Technically, Vegetative State Guy was woken by... yeah, Caustic Guy."
"So, what happened?","Gotta get him a steak, before I can ask him anymore questions."
He doesn't wanna talk about his son?,Didn't seem to emotionally register that his son is sick.
Brain issue? He was asphyxiated. Spent ten years as asparagus. Who knows what damage is in there?,It's possible. 'Course always the simple explanation. Maybe he just doesn't like his son.
Only in your world would that be simple.,The delusion that fathering a Parkld installs a perManent geyser of unconditional love--
"Maybe your father's feelings were conditional, not Everyone's--","Yes. Well, of course. That would play into your roMantic vision of huMan..."
"Terms you would understand. We have an evolutionary incentive to sacrifice for our offspring, our tribe, our friends. Keep them safe.","Agrees, but... Except for all the people who don't. Everything is conditional. You just can't always anticipate the conditions."
Then no it is. Cops have a thousand ways to make life difficult for you.,Quick! What's the kid's status? Gotta get back to our sleeper before he goes looking for the Orgasmatron.
House is a Woody Allen fan! That makes me smile.,"See, if that were rhetorical, it would mean I could just turn around and leave now, which I'm not doing. From which you should deduce..."

My daughter and I both have cartilage hair hypoplasia think you can make a pun out of that?,"Yes, but I don't want to be insensitive. Turns to Cuddy and indiCates at Maddy She's got a bit of a short fuse hasn't she?"
"It's a bleb, wait in my office.","Bleb's not a diagnosis, it's an evasion."
"We'll schedule an MRI to make sure, but a certain number of these cases are idiopathic.",Let me translate that into Tolkien for you guys - means Doctor Cuddy's got no idea why your daughter's lung suddenly popped like a balloon.
You think you do?,"Give me her chart, and my pills."
"Give me her chart, and my pills.",Santa needs us.
He throws the chart at Chase who looks up and we see a dark bruise on his jaw where House punched him Did you get that looked at? I'm fine.,"Great. I just admitted a cartilage hair hypoplasia dwarf, 15-yrs-old--"
What are you going to do?,"I thought I'd get your theories, mock them, then embrace my own. The usual."
Wilson told us he ratted.,Your choice of verb I take it?
"It's appropriate, he betrayed you. And you should take the deal.",Unexplained lung collapse and anaemia. Cuddy thinks it's idiopathic - Cuddy and idiop being the relevant parts of that sentence.
Can't be TB since Cuddy already ruled it out. He hands the case down to Foreman,Then you'd be just as big an idiop as her. Don't you people know your dwarfs?
"There are over 200 varieties of dwarfism, each with different medical complications you can't expect us to be intimately familiar with all of them.",The sick dwarfs sure expect you to.
Cartilage hair hypoplasia - they have compromised immune systems.,"Gold star for Cameron, for extra credit explain to the special needs section of the class why our Patient's negative TB test is irrelevant."
"A PPD involves planting a fragment of TB under the skin to see if the immune system recognises it, because of her compromised immune system, our Patient could have TB but not recognise it.",The little people love you. Gets up Let's go see a dwarf about a gallium scan.

I saw in the file that her dad was normal size. It's average-sized.,Compared to you I'm sure he was huge. Did he have a fetish or did he just fall in love with your long-legged soul?
"He grew up in the circus, said I reminded him of home. Seems like you're the one with the fetish.",Certainly curious about the logistics. Did you stand on a table?
I'm just trying to be helpful. She does slide over a stool and Abigail climbs on to the table,She also hates Jews.
"I've dealt with worse. Being different, you get used to people's idiocy. She throws that word behind her shoulder and Cameron glances over for a moment insulted Still beats the hell out of actually being an idiot. House breaks into a smile again at her words What?",Care to go for a spin?
"Gallium scan shows no bright spots of any kind, means it's not TB or any other infection.",There are no bright spots because the whole thing is too bright. Except for the liver.
"Could be lung cancer. Tumour causes structural damage, lung caves in on itself, also explains the anaemia.",Doesn't explain the liver pRoblem though.
"Her lung collapsed, there is no liver pRoblem.",Did you guys look at the liver on this thing?
There's no liver pRoblem.,"Seriously, look at the liver."
There's nothing there.,Why not?
Because there's nothing wrong?,Every organ in the scan is lit up like a hundred watt bulb except for her liver which is hovering around 60 watts.
You saying her liver's shutting down because the lighting is off? You just don't want a cancer diagnosis because then you'd have to deal with Wilson.,Lung cancer is a lame diagnosis. Avoiding Wilson is an added bonus.
"House, we need to talk.",Not taking the deal. Glad we talked. Ultrasound her liver. The ducklings make to take off
The ducklings make to take off Sit down.,Stand up. Looks to Cuddy Your turn.
"House, you're off the case. Your treatment privileges are suspended until you accept Tritter's deal.",Well I'm obviously not going to take the deal just so I can have the fun of treating a dwarf so I assume there's more to this threat.
I'm also cutting off your vicodin.,That could work.
I'm taking over as attending. Get an MRI of her lungs.,This is not lung cancer.
We'll find out as soon as we MRI her lungs. The ducklings file out,You're going to come begging me to save this girl long before I come begging you for pills.
You pretending your motives are pure is why I have a pRoblem. Where's Cuddy?,"In this drawer, it's a rescue mission. I got it under control, you can leave. He goes back to jimmying the drawer"
"checks outside in the clinic before walking in You were right about the liver failure, Patient had variceal bleeding which suggested cirrhosis.",I'm off the clock.
"You predicted this, you obviously saw something.",Obviously.
"Liver biopsy was negative for cirrhosis but it shows sclerosing cholangitis. He puts the sheet of paper of the results down on the table in front of House. House takes a glance, then ignores it Even weirder, there's no increase in alkaline phosphotates.",Hmm...
I take it that's where Cuddy's been keeping your pills.,"One theory, one drawer."
"One theory, one drawer.",Really?
"If that were true, more than her lungs and liver would be affected. He notices House looking at drawer and jerks his head to indiCate House should be helping him to keep a watch out for Cuddy",It will be.
I get why you don't want to go to rehab but only an idiot goes to prison for being stubborn.,Only an idiot stands between Ahab and his whale. Move. He opens the drawer and quickly searches but doesn't find any vicodin.
"He'd have made up any story for a pill, you didn't give him anything did you? No.",Ow. There's no bruise or nothing but it really hurts.
Unfortunately that pain and lack of bruising is typical of a zygomatic break.,"Wow, sounds bad."
"Hmm, bones are aligned properly. Which ER did you go to after the car accident?",Princeton-Plainsborough. He reaches inside his jacket to get a piece of paper Here's my discharge slip.
"Okay, going to get you some acetaminophen with codeine.","I err... I tried that, it makes me nauseous."
Err... there's a drug called gabapentin which is good for certain kinds of pain.,"Great, I haven't slept in days."
Gabapentin's not really going to help with the sleep.,Oh. Is there something else you could give me?
Vicodin's your best bet with sleep issues.,Thanks so much.
holds up a finger Unfortunately our policy forbids prescribing opiates to new Patients.,How can a clinic have a rule against relieving pain?
"Just for the opiates, we find that it helps weed out drug-seekers.",You think I'm a drug-seeker?
I'm not saying that.,Well then give me the vicodin.
Well then give me the vicodin. I can't.,Because you think I'm a drug-seeker?
I just said I didn't.,"No, you said that the policy was to stop drug-seeking. Then you said I'm not a drug-seeker, policy doesn't apply."
"I'm sorry, that's the policy.",Gabapentin works on nerve damage you're prescribing it for a broken face! Might as well hand out band aids for a sEvered carotid!
You're a doctor.,Not by this clinic's definition since I'm neither a moron nor a mindless drone! The doctor quickly picks up a phone and starts dialling
The doctor quickly picks up a phone and starts dialling Security--,"Forget it, I'll throw myself out."
You were right the Patient's pancreas is failing.,Told you you'd come begging me for help. His voice is very rough and husky
Her insulin production is almost non-existent. House is about to close the door in her face when Cuddy blocks the door,"Give me my pills, or lose an arm."
The girl is dying!,So give me my pills.
Take the deal and I will.,You'd rather kill this girl than give me my pills?
I would rather lose one Patient now than the dozens we will lose while you're in prison.,Well have fun explaining that to her itsy bitsy grieving mother. he slams the door at Cuddy
He is. She signs the consent form,"He says through the door without opening it Unless you've got vicodin, go away."
Oh god. I don't have--,"No pills, no eggnog."
notices House's arm through the gap in the door where he's poked his head out to talk to her What happened to your arm?,Cut myself.
"Wilson was wrong about lymphoma, kid's not losing any weight, no night sweats.",Cuddy send you?
No. She doesn't trust me not to give you pills.,She right?
"House, these cuts are straight in a row. You did this on purpose.","Cutting releases endorphins, endorphins reliEve pain. Can you get me some pills?"
Can you get me some pills? No.,Well then you can leave.
No constitutional symptoms means--,"Soon as the kid gets cured, Cuddy's got no pressure to fold."
You really think she's going to fold?,"Autoimmune fits better than cancer but lupus floods kidneys, usually attacks them first. Kidneys are fine, right?"
"Yeah. House, take the deal. You can survive without vicodin. After you were shot you stayed clean for months.","Yeah, only it had something to do with the absence of pain."
Then you can rip off the bandage. She proceeds to bandage the cut up,Kid been sick lately?
Got a history of ear infections.,You see Abigail's immune system is like a shy guy in a bar.
"Nerd gets drunk, thrashes the bar. One of the autoimmunes triggered by a minor infection.","Factor in her age, elevated sed rate, anaemia... it's Still's disease. Start her on prednisone, methotrexates, cyclosporin."
I'll order the treatment.,"Your plan isn't working. Two days down, one to go. Figured I'd show you how much it isn't working."
"Yeah, clearly the drugs have no hold on you.","We both know that my pride far surpasses my instinct for self-preservation. You want to redeem yourself, give up now."
And you'll go to jail.,I've done nothing wrong.
And you'll go to jail.,Which makes this your last chance to do me a kindness before ruining my life forEver.
"You know, it's little solace but he went without pain. House?","Well, look on the bright side at least you don't have to go by Mrs. Zebalusky anymore. That's gotta be a relief."
"I'm sorry, he's sick--",You hear my diagnosis on the dwarf?
gets up and faces House Trying to embarrass me in front of a grieving widow crosses lines that Even--,"Right, I'm pathetic. I'm strung out, I haven't slept, puking Every hour and I still out-diagnosed you. But I'm supposed to let you decide what's best--"
Please! Please leave.,subsides Sorry. I'm done. he starts to leave but is halted before reaParkng the door
"It's not her heart, she's bleeding.",Picking up a script for Zebalusky.
This is err... doctor Wilson's Patient.,"Yeah, Wilson's busy right now what with Mr Zebalusky dying in agony on account of his metastatic lung cancer and not having the pills to reliEve that agony because of"
Can I have a french fry?,Get your own.
You took the last ones.,What's wrong with you?
I've got spinal muscular atrophy.,sighs At least it's not contagious. he sets the plate of Parkps in front of the little girl Nice bear.
"House, it's not Still's. Steroids helped until the Patient started bleeding from the ears and mouth.",looks at Cuddy then back at the little girl It's a bear.
"You win, you can have vicodin. she shakes the bottle she's got in her hand and gives a rather funny grin","Words have set meanings for a reason, you see an animal like Bill and you try to play fetch, Bill's going to eat you because Bill's a bear."
It's between cancer and autoimmune.,See that's what we call a faulty syllogism.
Her leg looks fine.,Weird huh?
Why aren't you detoxing?,Willpower. He pops a pill
He pops a pill What--,Normal's not normal if you're not normal.
Did you just take a pill?,"No. Wilson looks at Cuddy, Cuddy looks annoyed So how does a dwarf have completely normal growth plates?"
with his rather one-track mind How Many pills have you taken?,Not nearly as Many as I'm gonna take. Forgotten how delicious they were.
I didn't give them to him.,Can we forget my vices and get back to my virtues?
"So what connects a long-term pituitary issue with pRoblems in the lungs, liver and pancreas?",Oh you guys and your bickering. Cancer versus autoimmune.
Obviously you think it's something else.,"Nope, I think it's both."
We dismissed this earlier because there were no neurological symptoms.,"Yeah... it's not your fault, the only neurological symptom was her height. Who could have noticed?"
"Yeah... it's not your fault, the only neurological symptom was her height. Who could have noticed?",This is your pituitary gland and this is the granuloma that's been crushing it.
She's not a dwarf?,Just hormonally challenged.

"If my daughter doesn't want to choose the easy path, I won't force her to.",Then you're a lousy mom. You want your daughter to be a freak.
We're not freaks.,sighs You want her to overcome adversity.

Abigail agreed-- he waits for House to pull down his headphones Abigail agreed to take growth hormone.,Who's Abigail?
Your non-dwarf dwarf Patient.,"Oh, good. Then the growth hormone makes sense. He stands up and starts picking up stuff."
He stands up and starts picking up stuff. Christmas Eve.,"Yeah, I know. Deal expires tomorrow."
You've plans for tonight?,You worried I'm going to be popping more pills? he puts on his coat
Thought you might prefer people over pills.,"Hey mom, I guess you guys are already up at Aunt Sarah's."
House? more knocking Are you okay? I called 3 times.,I'm ready to take the deal.
That's off the table.,The clock doesn't expire until--
Thinks about it Speaking engagement.,Not guilty.
And on the charge of gaining control of said medication by fraud how do you plead?,Not guilty.
You're going to go talk to him?,I was just going to ask him where he gets his haircut.
"Except that he wasn't the Patient or the doctor, he was the guy who stole from the Patient and the doctor. To House This was the 3rd time he's been disorientated in the last 2 weeks.","Running into smoke filled burning buildings can be a bit disorienting. Fortunately I have the cure, stop doing it."

"I'm not asking you to dance, I'm asking you to do your job.","EKG showed arrhythmia, pRobably just a mild heart attack."
"He was in the burn unit for six months and had multiple surgeries, could be a hospital acquired infection maybe MRSA.","Works for me, draw blood cultures start him on antibiotics, Vancomycin plus broad gram-negative coverage."

"Your Lawyer isn't going to be able to get the DA to drop the case, Tritter can.","Yeah, you know what else Tritter can do?"
You're not impressing anyone. You may call yourself principled but what you really are is a stubborn adolescent idiot! This isn't his fault.,I'm not the one who--
"Walking towards House YOU used the rectal thermometer on him, YOU insulted him instead of apologising, YOU flaunted your drug use in his face and you REFUSED to accept a deal...",I accepted the deal!
Not until after you stole a dead guy's pills.,Allegedly.
He's seeing blue House still in elevator pops a pill where'd you get the script from?,Cuddy. Wanna know what I gave her?
If it was thallium he'd be losing his hair.,walking into his office So maybe it's menopause.
"Yes, his age is the reason it's weird that a Man has menopause.","Male menopause, high oestrogen, low testosterone, explains temperature swings, disorientation, endocrinologically similar to female menopause but without the vaginas and mah-jong tiles."
"Following House, cue another walk and talk Male menopause doesn't explain the vision.","Blue vision isn't a symptom, it's a side effect of Viagra, it's right there on the label, which I have no reason to have read except that I'm a doctor,"
Interrupts House He's not taking Viagra.,"You mean he didn't tell YOU he was taking Viagra, and I don't care how sick he is, trust me, he still thinks he's got a shot."
He's presenting no other signs of premature aging.,"Aging's not the only cause, you said he's got burns to 54% of his body, sure it's not 55%?"
Burns to his genitals could cause testicular trauma.,Which could in turn cause...

Thank you. I know that couldn't have been easy for you to say. Even if you don't mean a word of it. Tritter starts to walk away but House follows him,I'm sorry! You can hook me up to a damn polygraph.
"Aggression comes on that fast, it's gotta have a neurologic basis. We should do a CT for frontal lobe tumour and an LP for meningitis.","Great, have at it. Walks out"
"Follows That's it, no challenging our theory, no tearing us down.","No need, you got it under control."
Where you going?,Upstairs this time.
To do what?,Check myself into rehab. Elevator closes
Did Tritter offer you another deal?,"Nope, this is all me. So no slaps on the back? Encouraging words..."
We are just trying to understand what this is.,"I hope this is me detoxing, otherwise I soiled a perfectly good pair of underwear last night for nothing."
"So this is for real, this is not just a show for Tritter?","Absolutely it's a show for Tritter, and the Judge, unfortunately unless it's real, there is no show."
Going to need to check that stuff.,"When I lead the big Patient rebellion, Voldemort here is the first to go."
"He may nEver be ready, you're doing the only thing you can do, keep trying. How about you Greg? You thought about how to fix things with people in your life?","No need, people in my life have no expectations of me, makes all our lives easier."
Apparently not. The first step in recovery...,"cuts him off Is admitting I have a pRoblem, I've obviously already done that or I wouldn't be here."
Kinda like your pills. If you could do this on your own I assume you wouldn't be here.,thinks about it True.
looking at the monitor It's not his lungs! He's got marked ST elevation he's having a heart attack Chase injects him with a syringe,Pick a colour.

We don't have an answer yet.,"I'm fine by the way, thanks for asking!"
The heart shows no sign of inflammation or...,"The cause of the heart attacks isn't internal it must be external, something environmental."
None of the attacks happened in the same place.,Still must be something in common.
His clothes were all different he'd been cleaned.,"That's the what's, how bout the who's?"
His partner Amy was at all three attacks but...,Anyone else?
People don't cause heart attacks.,Well then you should be worried about proving me wrong.
"We were clearing rooms in an office building fire, the ceiling collapsed and it cut me off from the rest of the group. I kept yelling that I was fine but Derek refused to wait for the team to clear the Debris so he took off looking for another access point. He got caught in a back draft. He almost died because of me once. And now it's happening again.","You're not my mom, you don't have to keep checking up on me."
How you doing?,"Not bad, considering I just learned that I'm completely powerless."
See this big fancy wing? It was built because this program works,Faulty logic.
I don't Even know what that means.,None of this means anything. It's just nonsensical slogans and platitudes.
Getting annoyed Meaning takes time. It takes work.,What do you think I've been doing?
"You've been here for two days! Talk about wallowing in it. We all get it, we know how much pain you have. You're here to deal with that and get on with your life.",Right! I should have an affair with a dying Patient and move into a hotel.
You're a coward House. You find fault in Everybody because you're afraid to look at yourself.,"Thanks, I was running short on platitudes, you can leave now. Takes a drag of his cigarette and blows it in Wilson's face. Wilson walks out shaking his head"
"But if you're too worried about losing your job to get it treated they can dEvelop into full on heart attacks, you think it's a coincidence this started when Amy got engaged?","No I don't, but now that you know the why what are you going to do to stop the how?"
We need to put him on antidepressants.,"Not if you're right. Antidepressants would inhibit his autonomic nervous system, which would only speed up the heart attacks."
"We could try propylthiouracil, slow down his metabolic rate.",Thyroid effect would only weaken the heart.
Only other option is blood thinners.,"This is not a fat guy with plaque-filled arteries and a swollen heart, he's a guy who's brain is trying to kill his heart."
"Chase's idea is as good as any, I mean short of frying his brain and wiping Amy out, we're screwed.",Epiphany We need Cuddy.
Epiphany We need Cuddy. Why?,So you can tell her why you need to fry a guy's brain.
The guy's heart isn't working and you want to shock his brain?,Electroshock therapy is the only way to erase his memories of Amy and stop the brain's chemical attack on the heart.
"This isn't 1940, the pRoblem can be controlled with antidepressants.",Cameron. House goes to the fridge
"Antidepressants would inhibit his autonomic nervous system, speed up the attacks.","Starts pouring himself a glass of milk LMNO, PTU, blood thinners, none of them would solve this pRoblem."
Thinks about it Go ahead.,"To the ducklings You heard the lady, go plug him in They leave, Cuddy goes to leave as well Am I really that pathetic? Cuddy stops and looks at him"
What are you talking about?,"If I'd pitched electroshock therapy as a cure for broken heart syndrome any other time, you'd have dug in and maybe tried another 100 useless things first."
Looking at what House has made Caterpillar?,Lower intestine with ulcerative colitis. Tritter smiles You crash art therapy classes just for the adrenalin rush?
"Cuddy wouldn't get off the phone until I promised I'd come see for myself. I gotta admit, this move I did not expect.","Well don't tell anyone but the photos of smiling people in the brochures, it's just marketing."
Well you're obviously making an effort. So I suppose the next step is for me to talk to the DA.,Which you have no intention of doing.
Shakes head No.,"So words mean nothing, actions mean nothing, what the hell is left?"
"So words mean nothing, actions mean nothing, what the hell is left?",Yelling from across the room You son of a bitch!
You Ever trust an addict? You Ever give one the benefit of the doubt? How Many times did it work out for you?,"Yeah yeah yeah, I get it, so you were screwed over by your mother, your wife, your partner, but you keep sending them Christmas cards while you take it out"
"We've given him four rounds of electroshock, the charge made his voice a little higher but the EKG and BP are good.",Good.
"Going to give him his last round in the morning, then be at court for your hearing.",Thanks.
"I'm going to stay here, monitor Derek.","Thanks for the update. House sees Wilson walking in My next condolence call is arriving, I'll see you guys tomorrow"
I got you something.,Reaches into the bag and pulls out a red tie Nice.
I figured it might help make a good impression on the Judge.,"It's not that nice... I had no business blaming you for any of this. I know you were just trying to help me, protect me, that's what friends do."
Surprised Is this.... an apology?,"Part of the program, if you don't like it I can stop."

It's a simple question. Has your life sucked? Tell her the truth. Tell her you were shot. Tell her...,She doesn't wanna hear the truth. She's looking for something. Looking to extrapolate something...
"She's looking to connect with you, and that's what's scaring the hell out of you. Tell her the truth.",There is no truth.

They're not in this room.,loudly No!

You only tested her for STDs?,"I had sEven morons who forgot their raincoats. 'S all they asked for, so I didn't waste the lab's time. Why?"
I wasted their time. softly She's pregnant.,You understand? beat You okay? I know you're not okay. Are you more or less not okay than you were five minutes ago.

Then nothing matters. There's no ultimate consequences. I couldn't live with that.,So you need to think that the guy that did this to you is gonna be punished.
I need to know that it all means something. I need that comfort.,Yeah. You feeling comfortable? Feeling good right now? Feeling warm inside?
"sighs, looks at House Do you think the guy who did this to me feels bad?",That'll help you? Make you feel better?
"Why do you always do that? Ask why I'm asking a question, instead of just answering the question.",The answer doesn't interest me. I don't care what he's feeling. I'm interested in what you're feeling.

Yeah. That occurred to me.,What took you so long to mention it?
"Just means he wasn't on drugs, not that he hasn't been using drugs.",Looking at scan on light board Looks like a plumbing pRoblem to me. Leaky pipes.
"If he popped an aneurysm he'd be in the morgue, not the ER.","That's why you're going to do a venogram instead of an arteriogram. This isn't a high pressure burst, it's a low pressure leak."

You must be Dr. House.,"Yeah. So, looks like there's been some sort of mix-up at the Parking office."
They had to move me closer to the door.,Had to? You don't look like the type to pull a weapon.
You don't look like the type to pull a weapon. Wheelchair.,Cane. I think you should do the honorable thing. Let me have my space back.
"Oh, well, uh. Since you ask so nicely!wheelchair.",Cane. Walking long distances makes my leg hurt.
And it's easy for me.,Course not. Pushing that little lEver. Thumb muscles must burn. I'm sure the last ten yards are pure torture.
Crossing the Parking lot is dangerous. Cars can't see me.,You Ever hit a patch of black ice with a cane?
"No. Gosh, on account of the fact that I can't walk. Maybe you should ask the Parking office for some crampons.",This is about who can most easily cross the Parking lot. You're the winner.
laughs You can't be serious.,Actually I can. Makes serious face See. It's my space and I want it back.
It's not your space. It's the hospital's space. And the hospital thinks the person who's worse off should get the better space. Your application for a handicapped space says you can walk 50 yards.,And Whitner's says she can roll 50 miles between oil changes. I can't change my leg.
The space I moved you to is only 46 yards away from the front door. I measured. You'll be fine.,Great. So I can collapse four yards into the lobby instead of outside in the cold.
As long as it's not in my office.,You know who won the New York City marathon six years in a row? Guy in a wheelchair!
Then go get yourself one and leave me alone.,"Give me my space, I'll be happy to roll around in one all day."
You couldn't last a week in a wheelchair.,Wanna bet?
What's wrong with you?,Nothing that a week off my feet won't solve.
Venogram's negative. No leak.,You mean you couldn't find the leak.
Is your leg worse?,No. My Parking spot is. Blood is only made inside the circulatory system. Which means when you find outside!
You're going to spend a week in a wheelchair just to get a Parking closer to the front door.,Easier than chopping off my legs.
Kind of. He's RoMany. Apparently they feel the need to keep secrets so it's hard to know anything for sure.,Yeah. He's also a huMan being. Which means you shouldn't be trusting him to begin with. Stop relying on his answers and find some on your own.
It's a deep vein thrombosis. The kid spent 16 hours in the back seat of an old pickup. Causes a clot and makes its way to his lungs. We should do an arteriogram and find the clot and bust it with tPA.,Or we should find the leak.
There's no leak.,"Hey. You can't yell at a guy in a wheelchair. This is a slow leak. You gotta speed it up. Thin his blood, redo the venogram."
That could cause a massive bleed.,backing onto elevator Excellent. Massive will be Even easier to find. Pardon me. I guess you guys are going to have to get the next one.
Ow. The kid's liver's failing because of massive clots blocking his hepatic vein. How can he have both a bleed and a clot?,flipping open charts the clinic desk is just above his armpit lEvel. It's not a clot. You must have blocked the vein with a catheter wire.
There's no heart failure or cirrhosis. Means it has to be a clot.,"Massive clots block veins, they don't Even leak. Since he clearly has some kind of! puts the charts together, can't reach the box they go in."

"Look, I think he's just faking so he doesn't have to go to school.",How did you know I was a truant Officer?
I told him he had a choice go to school or the doctor.,Right.
peering in Does it look like it hurts?,Nope. he crashes into table and pulls out a huge syringe
he crashes into table and pulls out a huge syringe What's that?,Syringe. I'm with you. Make him hate the doctor's office more than he hates school.
That's okay. I don't! I don't think that!,"It's just saline. It hurts like hell when it's injected directly into the muscle. Jack hides behind mom So, what do you think? Arm or ass?"

"No. Clotting, bleeding and a granuloma equals Wegener's.",I know. That's why I said fantastic. I was being sincere. Now give me a hand.

Liver's actually improving. We plug one hole and end up poking another.,We talking about the Patient or how to get a raise from Cuddy?
The Wegener's treatment gave him a massive hemorrhage in his bladder.,Which means! it's Wegener's.
We were treating him for Wegener's when Everything went wrong.,Not Everything.
"Yeah. It was a very lovely day outside. On the other hand, the treatment made him worse!","The treatment made his bladder worse, not his liver."

FT-28 is still experimental. It's not FDA approved.,It's worked for Crohn's Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis.

What's your name? Hannah Morgenthal.,"You have CIPA, Hannah Morgenthal."
"No, I don't.",We have to do x-rays to make sure you don't have internal injuries. Blood test to make sure no infections. An EEG for neurological anomalies and biopsy a spinal nerve.

Is this a real case or one of those imaginary cases that happen when you're bored?,CIPA.
CIPA is a diagnosis. Diagnoses happen at the end of cases.,She's got no idea what's going on in her body. There's gotta be something wrong.

"Do your tests, except for the!","So, while Everyone else was just worrying about getting in, you were concerned with about hat head."
Do your tests. Except for the nerve biopsy.,I need the nerve biopsy.
You'd risk paralyzing her.,But it's neurological.
You have no evidence of that.,She tripped.
"Do you have any evidence other than the fact that a typically clumsy CIPA Patient tripped on an icy day? House shakes his head If the EEG rEveals a pRoblem, we can talk then.",leaving You could have left the scarf at home and just told him you'd be wearing a look of desperation.

She won't consent.,She's a teenager.
"No dad, mom's still in surgery. What do you want us to do? Hold her down?","Well, only until you inject her with a sedative. Then you can let her go."
Then you can let her go. We tried.,Seriously?
She's strong and doesn't care. We'd have broken something before we could get her to sit still enough to inject her.,"So, break her arm. She won't mind."
She won't mind. You're cranky.,I'm in pain. Let's go break her arm.
I'm in pain. Let's go break her arm.,"Nurse Shortie, your biz-nitch, how long are you gonna waste her time."
I'm so glad we're walking somewhere. Another sixty feet and this conversation is over.,"When you guys are out of this program, Cameron will find somebody. Chase will find eight somebodies. And you'll be alone."
And you'll be alone. Thirty feet.,You'll date and you'll date. But you're the ultimate Darwinian. You've got to fight for Everything. Anybody else would just slow you down.
"I'm still with her, aren't I?",Yeah.
I want to see my mother.,Hi again.
I'm not scared. I'm nEver scared.,See? How juvenile was that? You can't feel pain. Nothing left but pleasure. Why don't you tell me how wonderful that is?
Why don't you tell me how wonderful that is? It sucks.,Better than being in pain all the time. Get in the chair.
Every morning I have to check my eyes to make sure I didn't scratch a cornea in my sleep.,"Oh God, stop. I'm in a pool of tears here."
I can't cry.,Neither can I. Every morning I check my eyes for jaundice in case the Vicodin's finally shot my liver.
I can't run anywhere without examining all my toes for swelling.,I can't run.

"You weren't shot because of leg pain, you were shot because you're a jerk.",Some think the two are connected.
She has a temperature of 105. pours pitcher of water over Hannah. She and nurse place cold packs.,Wow. She's actually sick.
We've got her temperature down below boiling. Could be infection.,No. LP showed normal proteins and no white blood cells.
High billirubin. Could be a liver pRoblem.,Nope. Transaminases were normal.
Could be drugs. She's smoked pot since she was elEven.,No again. Tox screen was clean.
Maybe we did something to her. Maybe she got sick after the tests. We should rerun them.,And biopsy a spinal nerve.
You want to risk paralysis because she's got a fEver?,I want to risk paralysis because I don't know what's causing the fEver. If it's neurological!
It's a fEver.,In a CIPA Patient. Obviously things are a little different in her upstairs wiring.
And have been since the day she was born.,Yah. It's much more likely that whatEver it is was clEverly waiting and hiding until you guys were done testing. Takes coat and starts out door
Where are you going?,"You're all against this, right? And, you're all going to stand on principle and refuse to do it, right? I'm going to get Cuddy's approval."
"Smiles. Then she sees House through the window. Her face falls WhatEver happens, I need you to understand that there are certain aspects to my life, I'm not happy about.",enters I need the nerve biopsy.
And you had to come here personally to tell me that. And how did you Even know I was here?,I had to bring the file.
"Uh, Don Herrick. Yeah, we connected through singleballroomdancelovers.com.",Why would he volunteer that information?
Why would I hide it?,"You didn't tell him that anything he said will be held against you? to Don So, what line of work are you in?"
"Uh, auto maintenance. Changing oil and filters.","Great, my place overcharges. You can't trust anything you guys say. So, where are you loCated?"
Most CIPA complications are infection and she's got a fEver. LP? Urine?,Clean. Normal. Same with the white blood cell count.
Same with the white blood cell count. Cancer?,"Nothing on the scan. I think it's her nerves messing with the temperature control. Amyloid, sarcoid, there's a lot of candidates. I want a biopsy."
"Fine. If that's what you need, go get it.",leans close to Cuddy's ear and announces loudly He seems a lot nicer than that one from Wicca needs a daddy figure dot com.
I am so tired of this. Did you know that the new nurse from cardiology is sleeping with that weird Lawyer from the board?,eating The guy with elEven fingers?
He has elEven fingers?,How do you not notice that?
The nurse used to be a Man.,She's not anymore?
But we can't talk about that.,I thought we were.
"We were supposed to talk about that. I came here to talk about that. But on the way up, I ran into Cameron. You've got a CIPA Patient.",Mmmm. Tranny nurse is more interesting.
"Oh it's way more interesting. But instead, I've got to be your damn conscience. I'm tired of being your conscience. I don't enjoy being your conscience.",No one enjoys
You're studying her....,She's actually sick.
Which you found out after you took her on.,"I was curious. Since I'm not a cat, that's not dangerous."
"I don't think that metaphor was designed to actually warn cats. You don't care about her illness, you care about CIPA. Which means your focus is going to be on getting your answer, not hers.",Thank you. Forewarned is forearmed.
What do you think you're going to figure out? You think her lack of pain is somehow the answer to your pain.,I think if you'd stop talking to Cameron then right now we could be ranking nurses in order of doability.
enters Need you.,What did the nerve biopsy show?
NEver did it.,"Well then, do it."
"Well then, do it. Can't.",Why?
She's going to jump off the lobby balcony.,And you think I can catch her? Foreman dashes out.
Is my mother out of surgery yet? Not yet.,This is excellent.
The paranoia seems to have dissipated but her vitals keep getting worse. She could be dead in hours.,"But if you're going to die a miserable, lingering death, pain free is the way to do it. Are we sure the fall didn't cause the paralysis?"
The paralysis caused the fall. Spine's clean. No veritable fractures or spinal cord compression.,Even better. The nuttiness and paralysis means there's definitely a neurological component.
Could be a nerve disease.,Which is why we need to look at the nerve that you didn't biopsy.
There are other tests!,"HIV? Syphilis? She was negative for all STDs. Vascular? No, ANA was negative. Cerebral clot? No, MRI was!"
Makes sense given her glucose reation was slow and her potassium is down.,Yeah. I'll check with an endocrinologist.
Bennett's on call.,Perfect.
Perfect. Nooooo.,Need a consult.
I already okayed your nerve biopsy.,I need an endocrinologist.
Bennett's on call.,Won't pick up. His cell phone must be broken.
His cell phone must be broken. Mine's working.,Had to give you the file.
reading I assume you're thinking thyroid storm. You done a hormone panel?,Normal. TSH was on the low side. Is that a cheery fire I hear crackling nearby?
No. What about CPK enzymes?,"Elevated. 275. Of course, people light fires for themselves. But then they don't deny it. He's here."
CPK isn't high enough. Potassium's what you'd expect because of the bronchodilators.,looks at her then looks skyward in exaggerated Manner Oh my God. You're not wearing a bra.
It's not thyroid storm.,You just met him.
I like him. And I like sex. Do I need to stitch a letter on my tops?,No. But it might be worth taking out an ad in the local papers.
"taking a couple of steps forward Do you like me, House? I was on the phone with Bennett 15 minutes ago. His cell phone's working. You're M.O is to avoid me at all costs. And suddenly you need my input on Every move you make. I can only assume it's because I'm on a date.","When we met, I noticed!"
"You noticed he was a Shriner because of the way he parted his hair. You noticed he was a momma's boy because of the way he blinked his left eye. I'm not interested. I'm not impressed. There are only two reasons anyone would want to screw with me tonight. Either they're an altruistic, decent person who's worried about my well being. Or, they want me for themself.",You left out the third option. Evil bastard who just wants to mess with other people's happiness.
Where did you go? She's getting worse.,It's not thyroid storm. Get me a spinal nerve.
There are still other tests.,"She just said the girl's getting worse. You really want to wait? Drops file on his desk. Looks around, confused."
"as House heads into the hall, followed by fellows We'll be risking infection. Maybe make the paralysis worse.",leaving office It is worse. We're making it worse than worse? Do the biopsy.
You could paralyze her and get no useful information.,Do the biopsy.
You're thinking peripheral neuropathy. We should take a nerve a little further away from the spine.,A little further from the truth.
"Give us a minute? Fellows leave, closing door Did you know they recently found a protein that speeds up nerve growth? Fascinating stuff. If you put that protein with the insulation from a spinal nerve, you could grow your own little garden. If that spinal nerve!","Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. If it happened to come from a person with CIPA I could grow pain-free nerves and graft them into my own leg. What an evil plan."
You'd have to be on immunosupressors for life. Risk of infection. Shorter life span!,"Shorter, but normal."
Usually jealousy expresses itself by trying to destroy what someone has. You're more ambitious. You actually want to change medical fact to get this thing you!,Medical fact changes all the time.
You're risking your Patient's life.,That's how medical fact changes. A doctor risks!
"To serve their Patient health, not their own.",This is medically justified.
Are you sure? Are you sure that you're the right one to be making this call.,"Biopsy whatEver nerve you figure you can safely get at. God, Wilson's annoying."
Means damage must be coming from the outside in.,Which means it's secondary demyelination.
Kid's mom is finally out of surgery,I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.,So what?
Hannah should see her.,"Yes, immediately after we're done chatting about saving her life. Most likely causes are metabolic."
They found brain swelling. They're prepping her mother for another surgery.,"Again, so what?"
There are only three of you guys. She's scared.,She should be. She'll die if we don't diagnose her.
I can't cry. Oh. My head's killing me.,"So, what does the pain tell us?"
"It tells us nothing. It wasn't physical pain, it was emotional.",Exactly. What were they doing when she got the headache?
What were they doing when she got the headache? Saying goodbye.,You said they were arguing.
They weren't really arguing. She was just frustrated.,What were they arguing about?
Whose fault it was.,"Peripheral neuropathy, fEver and intermittent paranoia. Lots of metabolic conditions can explain those things. But what if we add guilt?"
Guilt as a symptom?,Alzheimer's can cause euphoria. Pain causes depression. And B12 deficiency causes guilt along with all that other stuff.
"This is pointless. If the headache was caused by the illness, it means she has a B12 deficiency. If it's just because she was sad, it's meaningless. How the hell do we test for that?","We don't. Give her a shot of B12. If she gets better, I was right."
"We already did. holding chart The E.R. gave her B12 when she was admitted, part of a multivitamin supplement. Apparently she's just sad.",entering Why are you still here?
Trying to get a couple of Patients into a drug trial. Paperwork's due tomorrow. Why are you here?,I still haven't figured out why.
"No, I meant here. In my office.",Just dumped a cool B12 theory. Moved on to leukemia. drops file on Wilson's desk.
drops file on Wilson's desk. Very pedestrian.,I'm not happy. Her white blood cell count was low. But the ones she's got! Just a whole lot of eosinophils.
"The immunoglobulin E lEvel's borderline. If you want to be one hundred percent sure, check the bone marrow.","Team's doing a biopsy right now. sits So it turns out, the weird Lawyer knew that she used to be a Man."
And he's cool with that?,Turns out that his previous girlfriend also used to be a Man.
"Turns out that his previous girlfriend also used to be a Man. Ho, ho.",Yeah. reaches over and grabs half of Wilson's sandwich.
It's so you don't move during the procedure.,"Is that nitrous? What are you, trying to kill her? You gave her nitrous during the EEG. That's what made this thing rear it's ugly head."
That's what made this thing rear it's ugly head. What thing?,B12 deficiency.
Are you having dj vu? We've had this conversation. She was given B12. She didn't get better.,Because someone else ate it. Get an abdominal MRI.
"What? What are you doing? pulling away from them on the gurney, hysterical Don't touch me. Don't touch me.",See. There she goes. Another paranoid delusion. She's going downhill. Forget the MRI. We need an O.R.
Leave me alone. Occupied.,Her hernia can wait. he is pulling on gown as he talks. No mask.
Help. They're trying to kill me.,Okay.
"Bev, help them.","I'm going to need iodine, scalpel numbers 10 and 15, forceps and a largish salad bowl."
You're not going to anesthetize her?,Relax.
I could have a tapeworm in me?,"Not likely. You'd be in a lot of pain. As he continues to pull the tapeworm out, a nurse snaps a picture with her cell phone."
It's gotta be twenty five feet long.,Damn. World record's over sixty.
in doorway with House You could ask her for the spinal nerve.,She's got no reason to give it.
She owes you.,The hospital will send her a bill.
"I'm just saying, if you wanna do it, do it while her B12 is still low. Guilt can be your friend. they walk down the hall Breakfast?",Yeah.
blows raspberry in disinterest I'm going back to bed.,Where you going?
"There is no case, House. Even if dystonia was some big medical mystery, it's not this time.","You're not intrigued as to how a perfectly healthy ten-year-old boy, with no prior musical training, gets into an accident on his way to school..."

Why would you want us to think you...?,exasperated I didn't!!
in disbelief You faked cancer to get high?,I'm going to bed.
You're right! I don't like you! leaves,Sure. Now that I'm not dying.
Heard Patrick's hemispherectomy went well.,"He survived the surgery. He's unconscious, but..."
How depressed are you?!,I'm not depressed.
You faked... cancer.,It was an outPatient procedure. I was curious.
Are you curious about heroin?,"Not since last year's Christmas party. Whoof! beat I know this goes against your nature, but can we not make too much of this?"
You made people think that you were going to die!,protesting I didn't make them! I tried to hide it! You idiots needed to get into my business.
protesting I didn't make them! I tried to hide it! You idiots needed to get into my business.,"I'm sure I'll regret asking, but why are you laughing?"
"I'm sure I'll regret asking, but why are you laughing? It's ironic.","I'm sure I'll regret asking, but why...?"
"Depression in cancer Patients. 'S not as common as you think. It's not the dying that gets to people. It's the dying alone. The Patients with family, with friends... they tend to do okay. You don't have cancer. You do have people who give a damn. So what do you do? laughs again You fake the cancer, then push the people who care away.",Because... they're boring. looks at Wilson Go home to your hotel room and laugh at that irony.
"smiles wrily Start small, House. Take a chance. Maybe something that doesn't involve sticking stuff in your brain. Pizza with a friend. points to himself with a bow A movie. Something.",switParkng off the penlight Follow my finger.
switParkng off the penlight Follow my finger.,You know your name?
You know your name?,Speech centre was on the right side. It'll be a while before he's talking.
He hasn't really done anything except that... stare off into the distance.,nods It'll take some time to...
overjoyed You buttoned your shirt?,Looks happy.
"Up and at em, you're supposed to be in clinic duty.","Yeah, like I could sleep down there with all the crying and coughing."
Hands House a file. Here. Ex-Marine. Thinks he has gulf war syndrome.,Rolls his eyes. There's no such thing.
"So he's been told, it hasn't stopped the unexplained fatigue, rashes and joint pain. And just so you know, he's the nephew of a benefactor I owe a favour, so you're going to take this case whether you like it or not.",Why wouldn't I want to take the case?
You know him?,NEver met him before in my life.
House continues to stare at the photo. That's amazing.,No it's not.
No it's not. It's not?,"I can play the harmonica with my nose, make a penny come out of a Parkld's ear, or any other orifice for that matter under the right circumstances I could"
The right circumstance being their agreement to bill you on the same credit card.,What I absolutely cannot do is dream about someone I've nEver seen before.
Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it can't happen.,"True, it can't happen because it can't happen!"
Flushes with his elbow. Well maybe you didn't dream about this guy specifically.,"Right, just some other guy who looks exactly like him."
"No, you imagined some generic Marine then you placed his face in the dream after you saw the picture. Starts to wash his hands. Sort of a coincidence mixed with a little dj vu.",There's no record of him Ever coming into the clinic so I must have seen him before somewhere else.
"Fine, you've known him since cub scouts. The more interesting question isn't what you dreamed but why? House starts washing his hands as well. I'm guessing you're longing for either a renewed relationship with your dad or a new relationship with one of the Village People.",He was in the Navy not the Marines.
I thought your dad was in the Marines?,The guy in the Village People.
"Actually he's only in the Navy when they sang, In The Navy. The rest of the time he's just in generic fatigues. House stares at him. What? You brought it up! House starts to walk out. You didn't flush.",I didn't pee.
I didn't pee.,"Male, 34, just got out of the Marines after 2 years in Iraq."
Why is he here instead of the VA?,Because he has a rich uncle that Cuddy is trying to avoid fellating and doesn't buy the VA's diagnosis of Nothing's-wrong-atosis. Pops a pill.
That's it? You beliEve her but not me?,Stick to your guns Chase. Just because there isn't a single unifying symptom doesn't mean there isn't something going on. Could just affect Everyone differently.
You think this guy has Gulf War Syndrome?,Course not.
Why'd you take this case?,Because a good scientist continually questions his own theories and assumptions.
Cuddy's making him.,Now I'm making you.
Starts to walk towards his office. TV?,"Turns around. The pRoblem could be neurological, Everyone knows TV rots your brain. Continues to his office."
Scoffs. What did you go to medical school in France? There's no trace of uranium in his urine. He was given the vaccines and meds 2 years ago without any allergic or adverse reactions.,Has he Ever done any modelling?
If the lEvels are too low for us to detect they're way too low to cause any damage. House continues walking right past the office. Where you going?,Turns around. This way. Did you find out about any television or other media exposure?
Do you really care or are you just trying to waste hospital resources to get back at Cuddy for making you take the case?,"Of course I care, what a horrible thing to say. Do a Lexis-Nexis search and get a copy of his credit report."
Before or after we tell him to eat a banana and discharge him with a psych referral?,I say before.
Are you ok?,Yea just a little too much coffee this morning.
Were we... walking you to the bathroom?,Sighs.
"Alright. Puts her feet on the desk and leans back in the chair. Suit yourself. Looks at the screens, Chase looks contemplative.",Hits the wall.
What's going on? Good question.,What?
"You were wrong about the nothing's-wrong-atosis, you can fake fatigue and joint pain but you can't fake bacterial vaginosis in your mouth.",Where's his mouth been?
Says he hasn't performed oral sex on anyone for over a year.,Selfish bastard.
Because he hasn't been with anyone since his last girlfriend dumped him after he deployed to Iraq the second time.,Selfish bitch. Cameron rolls her eyes.
"No, his eyes and tear ducts are fine.",Who was his last girlfriend?
"Sarcastic. Yea we'll get right on that. Chronic fatigue, joint pain and opportunistic infection spells cancer, pRobably lymphoma. We should biopsy his tonsillar and subMandibular lymph nodes","Right about cancer, wrong about lymphoma."
It's not an STD you just said...,"Just do it. Hangs up the phone, goes back to the magazine."
Biopsy's inconclusive. I'm going to do a sialogram while we wait for the results from the additional blood work.,No hurry. PRobably nothing we can do at this point anyway.
Well if the cancer hasn't spread.,He's spitting stink. You should focus on the living. I need a prescription.
I just wrote you a prescription.,"For Vicodin, I need alfuzosin."
No you don't. You figured out where you met your Marine?,"What? Oh that, I haven't really thought about it. I can't pee."
You can't remember him can you?,I can't pee.
So stop taking the Vicodin.,I want to pee and not be in pain.
Why don't you go to sleep?,I don't pee when I'm asleep.
Maybe you'll dream about him again and maybe he'll give you an address.,I haven't peed in three days.
I read that REM sleep is the brain's way of working out pRoblems.,"Very useful, did you hear what I just said?"
Yea you lied because you want to avoid talking about your obsession.,I'm not obsessing.
Why don't you just ask him?,Yelling. I haven't peed in three days!
You'd be dead.,I'm not counting intermittent drips.
You'd be in agony.,I passed agony yesterday around 4. Pops a pill.
"Takes a drink of water from her bottle and starts tipping it from side to side, making a swishing noise, much to House's dismay. I think the pill is the way to go, we haven't had a condom break yet thank god, but it's bound to happen. Especially the way we've been doing it.",On a bed of nails?
No he's not kinky. He's just insatiable. I can barely make it to any of my morning classes.,Takes a deep breath. You smoke?
You smoke? No way.,Yelling. Stop it! Woman jumps and stops moving the bottle.
Woman jumps and stops moving the bottle. Quietly. Sorry.,Any history of hypertension? Blood clots? Strokes?
Nope. Besides my OCD I'm fit as a fiddle. Takes a drink of water.,You have OCD.
Duh. Can't you tell?,Any other compulsions besides drinking massive amounts of water?
No. That's it thank god. My therapist says it could be a lot worse.,You get up in the middle of the night to drink?
"Yeah, Every couple of hours.",Then your therapist is an idiot. Unconscious people don't have OCD. They can howEver have diabetes insipidus.
That's impossible. I eat candy all the time.,Different kind of diabetes.
Amazed. How'd you know?,"Easy, nice ass, no boobs, you got palms like a longshoreMan. Wait here, you need a CAT scan."
Oh my god.,"Don't worry, just means you'll be taking two hormone supplements instead of one."
Still no... relief?,I got relief. I just got no pee. Pops a pill.
If the pills didn't work you may need a catheter.,"You didn't come here to talk to me about my pee, what's going on?"
"Pulls out the CT scan and puts it on the light board. He's got cancer all right, but it's not in his salivary glands, it's in his brain. House gets up and walks over to look at the scans. And it's bad, at least 6 tumours, maybe more. He lost his hearing, his sight's pRobably next.",Death is pRobably next.
Death is pRobably next.,No way he could've grown all these in a week.
"Maybe they didn't miss them, just mixed them up. Switched his films with another Patient's by mistake.","Maybe, but it means some poor sap's getting his melon sliced in the VA for no reason."
This poor sergeant is going to be dead by the end of the week.,Where have you two been?
"Lunch. Why, what happened?","Wilson's found some fast growing, illusive, or magic brain tumours. What did you find?"
Loudly. You have them researParkng your dream?,Nope. I have them researParkng my Patient.
"This poor guy's brain is riddled with tumours and you're checking his credit report? To the ducklings. C'mon, I need you guys. Starts to walk out, ducklings follow.",Where you going?
To do my job.,He's not your Patient.
How is he?,He's dead.
Shocked. Oh god.,Least he will be in a few days. Question is why? The only explanation is that the VA hospital screwed up.
There was definitely no mix up I had them recheck.,"Yes, why would a government agency lie to cover up a mistake? Might've caused the death of a guy they've been trying to kill for the last two years anyway."
They didn't lie House pops a pill and then a second. Did you just take two Vicodin?,"No, it was an antidepressant, I was told to take two Every time you walked into the room."
Sighs and hands House a scan. The VA scan of his brain. No tumours.,Yes this has proved positive that someone didn't have tumours in his brain.
You paged us?,Why didn't you send his urine to Leicester like I told you?
Because you told me not to.,Why did you choose that moment to listen to me?
You think depleted uranium might have something to do with his tumours?,Radiation's the only thing that will make tumours grow that fast.
High doses of radiation. Even if he ate depleted uranium bullets for breakfast he still would have been exposed to less radiation than we've given him in the last two days.,Do it anyway.
No. Not until you give me a reason.,Because... I'm your boss.
A rational reason. Or at least admit that you don't have one.,I've got a full bladder and I'm not afraid to use it.
But you are apparently afraid of discovering something that you can't rationally explain...,Cuts her off. SHUT UP! Do what you're told. Cuddy and Wilson may not have to listen to me but you do. Leaves.
6 tumours don't just disappear.,Unless they were nEver there to begin with.
The VA didn't screw up.,Maybe someone else did. Maybe it was Dr. Self-Righteous.
Something that would cause it to show brain tissue in perfect detail but completely miss neoplastic tissue?,Then they were nEver tumours to begin with.
I told you I saw...,No you saw something that looked like tumours.
That miraculously healed?,"No, they were healed by the antibiotics we're giving him for the vaginosis in his mouth."
If it's an infection why didn't it show up in his blood work?,I don't know. Yet.
It's not the anaesthesia.,"John, John! We're going to figure out what's wrong with you, but first we need to know one thing. Have you Ever appeared in any pornos?"
"John, John! We're going to figure out what's wrong with you, but first we need to know one thing. Have you Ever appeared in any pornos?","Chronic fatigue, sore throats, rashes, putrid discharge of the mouth, multiple abscesses in the brain, hearing loss and last but not least lower limb paralysis."
It's got to be some sort of infection.,That's miraculously improving in his brain but getting worse in his ears and legs?
Could be an infection and cancer. Neoplastic syndrome could depress his immune system and cause the other symptoms.,"Mm-hmm. You're basing this theory on the negative biopsy, the lymph nodes that aren't swollen or the tumours that were nEver there to begin with?"
I was right. He's excreting depleted uranium in his urine. We should start him on an IV infusion of isotonic sodium bicarbonates.,It's not depleted uranium.
You're the one...,"Who asked for the test when we were thinking cancer, we no longer are."
Depleted uranium doesn't just cause cells to mutate it can cause cell death as well.,Not spinal cord cells. At least not until the dose is high enough to kill all his other cells first.
So you're saying the radioactive uranium in his urine is irrelevant?,Sighs.
"Got it, we're all idiots, what's your theory?",Give me your keys.
Give me your keys. Why?,"You Ever tried riding a motorcycle with a distended bladder? Wilson throws his keys to House. Keep him on antibiotics, check his hearing and paralysis Every hour. Starts to leave."
So you basically want us to do nothing?,No... I basically want to do nothing. I want you to keep him on antibiotics and check his hearing and paralysis Every hour. Continues leaving.
"Wait, you can't go home now.",Actually I have to go home now. It's two days past my bedtime.
House he needs your help.,And I need sleep. Hey it's the brain's way of working out pRoblems that the conscious mind can't solve during the day remember? Leaves.
No. Not yet.,"So, where were we?"
You have a nice night?,No. Gets rid of the remote and walks out.
The paralysis is ascending. Last check it was nearly to his diaphragm.,Tells us something.
Means it's getting worse.,Worse is something.
Actually it tells us it's not the uranium.,Did we think it was?
We started him on sodium bicarb to try and flush the uranium out of his system.,"Great, now the fact that he's getting worse tells us nothing. NEver thought it was uranium. For all we know uranium treatment is what's making him..."
Sodium bicarb infusion wouldn't have any effect on...,On what? Kind of hard to say what it would have an effect on if you have no idea what's there to affect.
We had to do something.,"Well next time, go with something that has a chance of working."
Like what? Did you come up with some brilliant idea while you were warm and cosy in your bed at home?,We need more information.
How much more information could you possible want? We have a medical history going all the way back to his great grandparents. A non-medical history going...,It's not enough.
It's all we're going to get.,Want to bet?
Who approved a sodium bicarb infusion?,"Don't look at me, I was home in bed."
He was only on the sodium bicarb...,He's bleeding out.
He can't be bleeding out there's no blood in the bed.,"Fine, he's bleeding in."
The paralysis must have reached his diaphragm he's not able to oxygenate his blood.,He's not able to oxygenate his blood because he doesn't have any left. Starts to put down Johns bed.
There's no evidence...,The only thing that would explain...
There's no reason for blood loss.,"There has to be a reason, he needs a transfusion."
He doesn't need a transfusion.,Nobody asked you. Puts the pillow under John's feet. In fact why are you Even here?
Because obviously you need my help.,Get out.
"House. Starts to walk over to House's side of the bed. His blood obviously didn't just vanish... Slips over, and notices a yellow liquid on the floor, puts his fingers in it. What the hell is this?",Looks down. Somebody must have spilled something. Goes back to what he was doing. Somebody else should be getting me four units of O negative stat.
"Still on the ground, notices the liquid is coming from Houses leg, lifts up House's jeans to rEveal a catheter bag with a rip in it leaking large amounts of urine onto the floor. What the hell is that?","It's a urine catheter collection bag with a rip in it, what hell's it look like?"
"It's a urine catheter collection bag with a rip in it, what hell's it look like?",What? More and more urine pours out of the bag. It's just urine. It's sterile. No one's getting me blood! House's nose starts bleeding. Why isn't anybody getting me blood?
House are you all right?,Why are you Even here?
I'm always here.,No you're not.
"No you're not. There got to be a reason. There has to be. House closes his eyes, there's a quick shot of each of the ducklings, then Cuddy who smiles, then John who opens his eyes and starts laughing Manically.","So, where were we?"
You have a nice night?,Yes I did thank you. I'm guessing better than our Patient. PRobably due to his BP and hematocrit plunging. Throws the remote to Foreman.
How'd you know? House walks out.,"The answer was staring right at us the whole time, as plain as the nose on our faces, or the nose on his face."
"What's going on, what'd he say?",No hairs and cauterisation scars.
Confused. Which means?,He had it cauterised.
How could you know that?,"Because it makes sense, undoubtedly done to stop the same Parkldhood nosebleeds that plagued his grandfather, undoubtedly because they were both born with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia."
What's he saying?,I'm saying you got a genetic disease that is destroying your capillaries.
That no one in his family has Ever been diagnosed with before?,"Not surprising, since the most common initial symptoms, skin rashes and nosebleeds, are often written off as the result of minor trauma or dry weather."
"Oh, looks like solving the case, solved your other pRoblem.","There is no medicine like happiness, except maybe laughter, or rubber tubes shoved up your urethra."
You cathed yourself?,"It's actually not that bad after the first... I don't know, 9 or 10 inches. Cath reliEved the spasm. I'm as good as new."
"Of course, just a minor spasm in a muscle you've been using multiple times a day without any pRoblem for the past 45 years. Not a major side effect caused by the overuse of a particular narcotic painkiller.",Flushes. Yeah that was my thought too. Walks over to wash his hands.
"Flushes with his elbow. So, no reason to think about cutting back on your use of that particular pill.",Thank god.
You really got the answer in your sleep?,"I got one in my sleep, the other one I got in the shower. Walks out."
"I got one in my sleep, the other one I got in the shower. Walks out.",I've been thinking about you. You lied.
"I didn't lie, I simply chose not to share completely irrelevant facts.",Like the fact that you lied. No wonder I couldn't place his face. You were practically swallowing it on the dance floor.
I was not.,"Talk about the cool uncle, he donates the money while the nephew gets the write off. Of course by write off I mean he gets to put your ankles..."
Puts her hand on his chest to stop House talking. This is exactly why I didn't mention our one date over two years ago.,Because of my t-shirt?
Drags House away from the nurses station. Because you are an obnoxious ass. Because you would've spent the whole time...,"That's very smart, because this way I spent my whole time completely focused on the Patient."
How did you Even remember him? We were only at that party for like 10 minutes.,What is this some new health plan? You service the Dean of Medicine and you get free health care for a year? Cuddy smiles. Why are you smiling?
You remembered him because he made out with me.,"I'm good with faces. So this plan, is it open to anyone? Is there a co-pay?"
You're lousy with faces.,"Don't make this about me, this is your humiliation. So how much for private room coverage?"
Still smiling. Get over me. Starts to walk away.,Oh give me a break. You hired me...
Because you're a good doctor who couldn't get himself hired at a blood bank so I got you cheap.,You gave me Everything I asked for because one night I gave you Everything you...
"Stop staring at my ass when you think I'm not looking, showing up at restaurants where I happen to be on a date and fantasising about me in the shower. That ship sailed long ago House. Get over it. Walks away.",If you're still referring to you ass I think that super tanker sailed would be a more precise metaphor.
If you're still referring to you ass I think that super tanker sailed would be a more precise metaphor.,"Sorry, looking for an extra large trash can. Dumps the files and paper in the bin and walks out shutting the door behind him."
"S. S is speech. I'm slurring. I'm slurring? Huh. Oh! Tyson puts down guitar and turns back to Emma. Oh. F-A-S-T. T is time. Hurry, somebody, uh. Call 911. Tell them I'm having a stroke. She falls flat on her back and lays there. Everyone rushes around her.",Hi. I'm Dr. House. My boss says you're important. Slides door closed.
Slides door closed. Oh.,Personally I don't get what's so hard about making Scarlett Johansson look pretty.
"It's so easy, you should consider a career change. PRobably make a lot more money. With her eyes closed, her right hand starts turning inward.",Dr. MackMan tell you the clot was clear?
MackMan tell you the clot was clear? Yes.,And he said you and the fetus are fine.
And he said you and the fetus are fine. Yeah.,He didn't mention your pronator drift.
What's that mean?,It means MackMan is an idiot. He sighs and gestures to the side of the bed. May I?
Yeah. He moves her camera out of the way so he can sit on the bed.,So. You take thousands of photos of someone but only one has to look good. Kind of the opposite of my business. He is checking her eyes while they talk.
It's not about looking good. People are always hiding things. I just keep shooting until I can see what's really inside them. My eyes okay?,Eyes are gorgeous. Vessels don't look so hot. Micro-aneurysms predict further strokes.
This is going to happen again?,Unless I can figure out the underlying cause.
"Oh, my uh! baby's biological father is a neurologist. He once told me the FAST mnemonic could save my life one day so",Interesting pet name. Most people go with husband or pookie.
He's gay. Just a sperm donor. So when you,You turned him for a night? Just straight for one date?
Okay. He took a magazine and a cup into my bathroom.,A Man after my own heart.
"He's caring. House enters, walks to picture and pulls it down.",Find anything else in the Patient's folder? Like a diagnosis?
Urinalysis rEvealed excessive protein and red blood cells. Chem panel showed a creatinine lEvel over 2.5.,"So first she strokes, now her kidneys are shutting down. Why?"
BP is fine. No preeclampsia.,Any of you guys Ever been to the Galapagos?
"Was our Patient there? Dengue fEver, avian pox. Even West Nile.",No. I'm looking for a vacation spot.
That mean we get vacation?,How would that differ from your current status?
You're going to do what? Relax?,Visiting family. My uncle's a giant turtle.
"What if the kidney failure came first? Kidneys could have caused the stroke, not the other way around.",Kidneys don't often get stuck in the brain.
"I'm saying it threw a clot. Early symptoms of kidney failure are nausea, vomiting, swelling. She could have mistaken it for morning sickness.",Heart's way more likely to throw a clot than the kidney.
Echo's normal. The history indiCates no sign of cardiac pRoblems.,"No, but if one were to read the history closely, one would have noticed that she had six cases of strep."
In her throat. That's the one about 10 inches above the heart.,Let me rephrase. Six cases of untreated strep.
She was prescribed antibiotics.,No one takes them all. They stop when they start feeling better. All strep is untreated strep. What happens when strep goes untreated?
It leads to rheumatic fEver.,"Which leads to, Cameron?"
Mitral valve stenosis.,Which is a thickening in the valve of the!kidney? No. The kidney doesn't have a mitral valve.
We'll go look at the heart. The fellows start to leave. House calls after them.,"It'll be easy to find. It's the big, red pumping thing about ten inches below her throat."
Start threading the catheter.,"I don't want a layover in Frankfurt, Taipei, Singapore or London, Ontario."
Can you tell Cuddy to stop interfering?,It's her job. What's new?
You're vacationing in Cambodia? You're going to unwind in the killing fields?,Nope. Gonna catch me a fish this big. He holds his arms very wide. Mekong giant catfish weighs over 600 pounds.
Aren't those catfish critically endangered?,That's why it's my last chance to catch one.
There are only a few possibilities. Patient's pregnant. It could be preeclampsia. We eliminated it before because,Check for proteinuria and low platelets. What else?
"Hypoperfusion. The fetus is basically a parasite, stealing nutrients, minerals, blood.",Put her on telemetry.
"A cholesterol embolism is just as likely. Tiny particles of cholesterol rain down, clog up the small vessels in the kidneys.",Get a smear and ultrasound her vessels for plaque.
"That's it, has to be one of those five.",You know what would be Even better? If we could narrow it all the way down to one. They fellows leave in unison.
Looking up from microscope and turning to the others. She's 0 for 5.,Either the differential was wrong or she's faking it.
We did the labs. No one else had access.,That's not quite true. He exits.
Through oxygen mask You put all your Patients through this Many tests or just the important ones?,Bending down and picking up a piece of clothing from the floor We wanted to explore all the possibilities.
Bending down and picking up a piece of clothing from the floor We wanted to explore all the possibilities. And?,We've eliminated all the possibilities.
You're telling me I'm dying and you have no idea why?,Your body is functioning properly.
So why are my kidneys failing?,The other body isn't. There's something wrong with the fetus. Emma looks at him and tightens her mouth.
The other body isn't. There's something wrong with the fetus. Emma looks at him and tightens her mouth.,Welcome to the world of maternal mirror syndrome.
Who are the Jews in this metaphor?,A few things can happen to a fetus in distress.
I've read the outcome of mirror syndrome is almost always unfavorable.,Unfavorable. Is that doctor speak for dead baby? You think she'll be less upset if you phrase it nicely?
"We can tell her the truth that she'll be fine as soon as we diagnose a person who weighs about one pound. Can't touch it, can't ask where it hurts, can't see it.",If only there existed giant maParknes that could look through huMan skin. Mirror syndrome has a limited number of known causes.
"Tacharrythmia, fetal anemia, placental chorioangioma","All of which are fixable. Which would be un-unfavorable, right?"
"Could also be trisomy 13, Epstein's anomaly, an aneurysm of Galen's vein",And Dr.
It was in the range but blurry. The fetus was moving all over the place.,So we need another scan.
"Yeah. We'll just ask the fetus to lie very, very still.",No need. I'm going to paralyze it.
You want to paralyze Emma Sloan's baby?,Let me guess. Cameron.
Cameron and Chase both had their concerns.,"No, Cameron had concerns. Chase just agreed with her because he didn't want to lose his all-access pass to her love rug."
They're sleeping together?,If by sleeping together you mean having sex in the janitor's closet.
If by sleeping together you mean having sex in the janitor's closet. Here?,"No, the janitor's closet at the local high school. Pumps his fist Go, Tigercats. Do you have one of those camera-phones? Because I have a MySpace account."
I will deal with them after I deal with you.,"Oh, come on. Let's gossip some more. I'm sure she's into bondage. Cuddy grabs his arm and turns him to look at her."
Paralyzing a one-pound baby risks damaging,Not paralyzing the thing risks not getting a clean MRI of its heart. Which we need to save its life which we need to do to save Emma's life.
You're gonna need to get her consent.,That shouldn't be too hard. Sign here or you and your baby both die.
I'm going with you.,"Oh, good."
You said sedation was risky. This sounds insane.,The injection goes into the umbilical cord.
The baby won't feel a thing.,Fetus! I'm lowering expectations. It works here and on dates. The benefits outweigh the risks and the paralytic will wear off in an hour. Okay?
"It must be easier to hear that you might die than your baby might die. But if there's anyone I would trust to save my baby, it would be Dr. House. Emma snorts again.",whispers Fetus. Hold this.
Chase isn't the one who's gonna get hurt here.,There's only room for one. Though I could scooch over.
My social life is my social life.,Couldn't agree more. What goes on in the privacy of a janitor's closet is nobody's business except
She told me to end it. Is that what you want?,I was actually hoping she'd fire one of you.
What are you doing?,Trying to avoid altitude sickness. Couldn't score a direct flight to Cambodia so I decided to scale Argentina's infamous Mount Aconcagua
"Perfect, except for the fact that you can't walk.",There's a tribe of Macovi Indians who actually carry the elders up
There's a tribe of Macovi Indians who actually carry the elders up You're insane.,I'm an insane genius.
What are you doing?,"Well, you're trying to be me so I thought I'd try to be you."
You don't have the cleavage for it.,But I have a much tighter ass.
They aren't back yet.,They're gonna to be inconclusive.
You think my diagnosis is wrong?,"Fetus doesn't pee, amniotic fluid should be low. Mom's lEvel is fine."
Doesn't mean I'm wrong. Could just mean we caught the obstruction early.,"Either way, your test will be inconclusive."
"Fine, then I'll do another tap.",Just as useless.
Thank you. I'll run two more taps.,Since when does the Dean of Medicine run bladder taps?
She's an important Patient.,Because she takes pictures?
Pushing the file at him It's your file.,I don't want it.
Then why did you just say all that stuff?,To humiliate you.
You're taking the case back.,I don't want it. Your diagnosis is right. I wanna go on vacation.
Emma's jaundiced. Her liver's shutting down.,big sigh Figures. Just booked my trip to Johnston Straight.
I thought you were climbing Mount whatEver. In Argentina.,Apparently I'd have to live with the Macovi Indians for twenty years before they'd consider me an elder.
"Increased AST, ALT and her bilirubin's off the charts.",Even fetuses lie.
We won't be able to get a good look until they dEvelop. It'll be weeks,She's not going to last weeks.
What do you want to do?,Maternal Mirror Syndrome has one surefire cure. Deliver the fetus.
It's not viable at twenty-one weeks. You'll kill the baby.,Fetus.
Do seMantics make you feel better? Pretend it's not a person?,Can it play catch?
Can it play catch? Can it eat? Can it take pretty pictures? Who wants to tell her? All three refuse to meet his eyes. He pushes off his desktop and grabs his coat.,The swollen bladder was not the only pRoblem. We can't leave it inside you. We have to terminate.
"Well, can't you deliver him? Put him on a respiratory maParkne until you figure out what's wrong.",We can. And it won't matter. The fetus is still at least two weeks away from being viable.
"Oh, well. I'll suffer through this for at least two more weeks, then.",You're on dialysis for your kidneys. Your kidneys can wait. They don't make dialysis for your liver. You're not going to make it two more days.
thinks about this then shakes her head slightly I'm not gonna let you kill my baby.,It's killing you.
I'm not having an abortion.,It's not a baby.
Or you fix him and we both live.,I can't fix it. I'm scheduling a D and C. He gets up to leave.
I won't consent. He stops and looks at her. So I guess you have two days to figure it out. He leaves.,Her kidneys are almost irreparable. She's dEveloped sEvere DIC. You have to force her to terminate.
Did you give corticosteroids to speed the baby's lung dEvelopment?,No! I dropped an anvil on its chest to prEvent lung dEvelopment. I'm trying to extinguish the huMan race one fetus at a time.
"Give the lungs more time to expand so you can see inside them, see if they're the pRoblem.",My real Patient is dying.
"You're not going to get Emma to see it that way. She's pRobably already named the baby. Read him books, had conversations with him.","See, you get it. She'll listen to you."
She'll listen to you. No.,"You let this Woman refuse to terminate, you're helping her commit suicide. As her doctor, my recommendation is against suicide."
"If the baby had a doctor, I think she would recommend exhausting all possibilities before taking its life.",Then she'd be an idiot.
What if our original assumption is wrong.,It isn't.
The fetus is hydropic and in distress. Emma's kidneys and liver are failing. The diagnosis is solid.,"Wow. If the ass kisser won't agree with you, you must be Even wronger than I thought."
"Fine. Let's assume she had mirror syndrome but we fixed it when we fixed the baby's bladder. That means that her failing liver would be completely unrelated. If it is, we can fix it. And we don't have to terminate.",So her theory is that our Patient's liver pRoblems were just a giant coincidence.
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy would have the same symptoms. Thank you.,Brown-noser.
Viral hepatitis. HELLP syndrome.,Oh look. Sticking up for your girlfriend. Who says Parkvalry's dead?
He's not joking? Cameron gives him an exasperated sigh.,Be Patient. She's going through all of us. She'll get that jungle fEver Eventually. Cameron glares at House.
I'm not going through anyone.,You love him? Chase and Cameron each give him a look.
Wilson sighs. It worked.,What worked?
I got the baby's lungs to expand. We should be able to figure out,Cab's on its way. I have to finish packing. He starts to close the door. She pushes it open.
I have a whole new appreciation for what you do. How hard it is to beliEve when Everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong.,Helps to know they're idiots.
Do you think I'm an idiot? She pulls out an x-ray.,You're not objective. But you're not an idiot. He takes the film and holds it to the light. His lungs are still two weeks away from being viable.
But big enough for a diagnosis.,These tissue buds are new. Could indiCate bronchopulmonary sequestration or diaphragmatic Eventration.
I was thinking bronchogenetic cysts or bronParkal atresia.,Could be lung lesions. CCAM.
"What about House has slammed the door in her face. She stands there for a few seconds, apparently in shock when the door reopens. House has put his jacket on.",Move. He motions for Cuddy to back up so he can lock the door.
I thought you started your vacation.,Somebody had to save our boss' rotundous ass. Latest MRI of the Sloan fetus.
Small buds in the lungs could indiCate,"Thanks. Got that multiple choice all worked out. The question is, how do we pick between A, B, C, D and none of the above."
Fetal lungs are so tiny an MRI won't give us the details we need.,What would we do if this Patient were not just a tadpole. Say it was an actual person.
He! is a person.,"Thanks for playing along. Pretend that it's a one-pound adult. Forget the mom, forget the womb, the placenta. How would we get a better look at what's in the lungs?"
Too much radiation for a one-pound person.,"Makes whining eheheheh sound. You can't just shoot Everything down, Chase. You're not me. Collaborate."
A ventilation perfusion scan would be next. Foreman looks like he's about to shoot that one down.,How do we get a fetus to breathe in a radioactive isotope? Idiot.
"If it were really a person and we had no other options, we'd do an exploratory surgery. Cut into his chest and have a look around.",Let's do that.
"Let's do that. He starts to leave, stopping next to Cuddy. You're the one who insists we treat it like a person. I'll put it back when I'm done. He leaves.",Me again.
The umbilical cord won't be cut. During surgery your body will basically serve as the baby's heart-lung maParkne. We find what's wrong and we fix it. If we can.,out of corner of his mouth but at regular volume Don't lower expectations if you want them to do something.
She should know what she's facing. House is doing ultrasound of baby. This is incredibly dangerous. It risks both your lives. The only reason why we're suggesting it is because there's nothing else we can do.,You all here for the fetal surgery? Because we are way over capacity.
You all here for the fetal surgery? Because we are way over capacity.,Mind each other's personal space. There are sharp implements in the room. Like this one. He holds up scalpel and starts to incise Emma's belly. Uterus is fully exposed.
And we're in. Start draining the amniotic fluid.,Have you nEver sucked beer out of the bottom of a keg? Where'd you go to college? Gimme that.
Affix the pulse ox to the palm. He continues to look at the hand and stroke it with his thumb. House.,"Sorry. I just realized I forgot to TiVo Alien. He attaches paper, presumably the pulse ox, to the baby's hand."
"Fetal heart rate good, stats are stable.",Position him for the incision.
"All right, I see three well-defined lesions. It's definitely CCAM. I should be able to resect them. Monitor starts beeping.",It's the mom. She's in V-fib.
I'm clear. Cuddy shocks Emma. Everyone looks at monitor.,Looks like asystole. Paddling's not going to do anything.
It's fine V-fib. I'm going again. Monitor still flat.,"We're going to lose them both. Clamp! The surgery's not doing this to her, the fetus is. He starts to clamp the umbilical cord."
"Step away, House. I'm going again.",The only way to save her is to cut away the anchor holding her down. He starts to cut the cord.
"So my kidney, liver and lungs are all fine, just like that?",Just like that.
Just like that. That's amazing.,What's amazing is how blond your baby's hair is.
laughing My baby?,"You know, the thing in your belly that tried to kill you."
You've nEver called him a baby before.,stares at her Any pain?
Nothing I can't deal with.,"You can only get out of bed to pee, poo or shower. And absolutely no sex. So stop flirting with me. He takes a Vicodin."
Sorry. So this really worked. He'll be! normal?,"Um. If you call being born twice, normal. He gets up to leave."
"Hey, thank you.",Don't thank me. I would have killed the kid.
House. Need you to take a look at something.,I'm off the clock.
Just open it. Hands him envelope.,pulls something out First class ticket to Vancouver Island.
Shoot. It's the wrong envelope. She giggles. I think it's great.,Yeah. Who doesn't like Canadians?
It's big. You're you're trying to have a life. You're trying to enjoy yourself.,You didn't need to apologize.
I'm not. I told you why I'm,You screwed up.

"Lack of oxygen, forces the body to over produce red cells.",What explains the lack of oxygen?
Scoffs. He says he's not.,"Hey! Don't make me turn the hose on you two. Chase is right. You two go check the House, see if Dad's a closet Marlboro Man."
You're intentionally punishing us.,By making you do your job?
Turns to House. What if it's sexual? We should call social services.,Well this sucks.
We can't do a vaginal exam on a 6 year old without the Dad's consent and if he's abusing her he'll nEver say yes.,NEver is just rEven spelt backwards. Hands the t-shirt to Foreman and leaves.
Are those the urine test results?,Yes.
Yes. And!,I'm going to ask you for some blood.
I'm going to ask you for some blood. Why?,To see if your answer will be 'I can't bleed in public'. This wasn't your urine was it?
Why would I give you someone else's urine?,Usual reason is because you're on steroids.
I'm not an athlete.,Duh. The second favourite reason is because you're on drugs.
The second favourite reason is because you're on drugs. I'm not.,I am.
"Need you, now. Leaves.",My work here is done. Starts to leave.
Am! I! ok? Is it diabetes?,"No, you're pregnant."
6-year-old abuse victim and you haven't called social services?,She might have been abused. That's horrifying. Why are you wearing extra concealer under your eyes?
"The law's clear, you suspect abuse you call the authorities. You don't proceed as usual while the possible abuser sits by her bedside.","Dad consented to the exam, which means it's not the Dad. How late were you out last night?"
It's always the Dad and I don't have a curfew.,Loudly. Panty hamster get a spin on its wheel?
"I went to a play, House is shocked. House you are going back to your office, you are picking up your phone, calling social services and you are reporting suspected abuse. Do you understand?",What play?
Do you understand? What play?,You're trying to have sex with Cuddy.
Looks at House. Fries?,You took her to a play. You only take women to plays because...
"No, YOU only take women to plays for that reason. That's your theory.","Ok, then why did you take her to a play?"
She's a friend.,A friend with a squish mitten.
It is possible to have a friend of the opposite sex without...,"Blasphemer! She's not a friend of the opposite sex, she's a different species. Takes a fry. She's an administrator. She's going to eat your head after she's done."
"Yes, I slept with her.",Shocked. Seriously?
Seriously? No.,Not convinced. Yes you did.
Quietly. Yes I did.,Shocked. Seriously?
We just tested the blood on Lucy's t-shirt. It's full of endometrial cells.,It's not her blood.
"She got her period and didn't know what it was. She was scared and confused. A friend told her to put a t-shirt in her underwear. When she started growing pubic hair, she snuck Daddy's razor and tried to shave it off.",Apparently forgot to sneak the shaving cream.
She's 6. She's tiny. She lives on Parkcken fingers and milk. Dad doesn't look like the type to read labels. He's pRobably buying stuff packed full of hormones.,Excellent argument. To Foreman It's a tumour.
"There's all sorts of environmental sources. Pesticides, soy products! Some shampoos are basically a placenta in a bottle.",If the tumour's not in her brain it's in her reproductive tract. Get an MRI. Gets up.
Can I at least...,Waste your time? Wouldn't recognise you if you didn't.
You have to choose one. There's a bright spot on her left ovary. Looks like a solid tumour.,They printed my letter. Pays for the magazine and starts to walk off. Wilson runs up behind him.
You were right.,Of course I was. What are we talking about? Holds up the magazine. They printed my letter.
They printed my letter. Great. Cuddy.,You want to see her naked. They walk over to the doors to the Clinic.
"No, no, no. She wants to see ME naked. She sent me flowers.",Just thanking you for the play. You see some people fell an emotion called gratitude.
There's a card.,I suspected. Explains how you knew who they were from.
Pulls out the card and shows House. Lets do it again. Soon. X X. Lisa. Xs are the kisses right?,No! I think they're the hugs. I think Os are the kisses.
"No, no, Xs are definitely the kisses. Soon is its own sentence. Sees Cuddy in the clinic. I got to go. Walks off quickly.",I'll miss you. You were a good friend. House walks into the clinic towards Cuddy. Holds up the magazine. They printed my letter. How was the play Mrs. Lincoln?
What's up with Wilson?,He's just a little freaked.
He's just a little freaked. Why?,I sent him flowers. Smiles. Cuddy looks confused.
"Get him off! Cameron starts trying to pull Jasper off, Jasper bites Chase's arm and growls. AHH! He's biting me! Get him off! AHH! Cameron pulls him away, Chase looks at the big bite mark on his arm that is bleeding.",Answers. Somebody better be dying.
Lucy's big brother's got a crush on me so he bit the crap out of Chase.,And I care because?
Just thought you might want to know when one of your employees gets attacked by a sociopath.,"Bees or monkeys yes, sociopaths no."
"Bees or monkeys yes, sociopaths no. Hello?",He's not a sociopath.
How do you know?,He's acting logically. He's got a crush on you. He's being aggressive about it. Not just regular aggressive. He's out of his mind on hormones aggressive.
You think he's...,Better figure out what's killing the girl cause her brother's got it too.
Yes you would think that if for some reason you were completely unaware of the fact that we spent the entire night testing Everything from that home. It was all negative.,To Foreman You went home? Foreman nods. House is pleased. Good for you. Delegate.
We're not his subordinates.,Making it all the more impressive.
Turns to House. That's ridiculous. If menstruation is a symptom of brain cancer then I should be on chemo right now.,That's ridiculous. You're way too skinny to be menstruating.
What if the mum had other pRoblems? Symptoms her doctors ignored on account of the fact she was already dying.,"Pull all of her medical records, find any similarities to our Patients, and punch the little brat on the nose so he doesn't have a stroke like his sister."
Stomach pain is from a cyst in her pancreas. Found two more in her kidneys and one in her lung. They weren't there 48 hours ago. The hormones are making her body go haywire.,"If she gets one in her brain or heart, she's dead. Turns to Cameron and Chase. No pressure though."
It's not genetic. It's not environmental. It's got to be a pituitary adenoma.,"Yes, that would make complete sense if they had one."
Just because we haven't found anything on the scan doesn't mean it's not there. We should remove her pituitary gland.,"Two siblings, same condition. Its got to be genetic or environmental. If you add in 'same time' and we're back to just environmental."
Yes and that would make complete sense if there was anything in her environment.,Mimicking Cameron. Just because we haven't found anything yet.
I'm getting the father's consent. Starts to leave.,No! Cameron stops. We have no evidence.
The ovaries produce sex hormones in response to a signal from the pituitary gland. Since we know the ovaries are fine the most likely cause...,"Interrupting. Most likely means she wants to root around inside your little girl's brain without any guarantee that it will work, that's why she's holding off on doing your son."
Dr. House knows that unfortunately we've ruled out Every other option. We need to resect Lucy's pituitary before...,Who else visits these kids?
They don't have any family in town.,You got a girlfriend?
No one visits.,School?
"They don't go to the same school, House I...",Nanny?
They go to an after school day care but none of the other kids are sick.,"Yet. It took your son twice as long to dEvelop symptoms as your daughter, maybe the other kids are just slow."
We wait and your daughter may die.,She does this and your daughter will need hormone replacement therapy for the rest of her life.
The treatments are extremely effective. She should lead a relatively normal life.,"And isn't that Every parents dream, to have a kid grow up to be relatively normal."
My husband died of thyroid cancer that metastasised to his brain. I've been there. I know how terrifying this can be. I am telling you this is your best chance to save your daughter's life.,Whispers in Cameron's ear.
Thank you. Leaves.,How did you know?
Stops and turns around. Know what?,That the other kids weren't sick. You've been here for 4 days.
I just... I would've heard. Leaves.,Right...
Leaves. Right...,Smiles. Do you have hair on your special place?
Can I help you?,I'm a doctor. Two of your kids are sick and I need to know why.
You think they got sick here?,I think you're dating their Dad.
He told you?,"No, but I don't really care why he didn't. I just need to know how often you go to their House and what you bring."
I just need to know how often you go to their House and what you bring. I don't.,"Shampoos, fancy soaps, kids get in your bag?"
"I've nEver been to their House. They just lost their mom, and we thought it was too soon. House stares at her rash just above her lip. Why are you staring at me?",Lip wax?
I just had it done over lunch.,Grabs her hand. Mani-pedi?
"Pulls her hand back. No, just the wax.","Women get a wax as part of a whole self-indulgent beauty ritual pedicure, steam, cucumber masks."
You're an ass. Cameron.,It's always the Dad.
It's always the Dad.,"Excess facial hair in women, it's a clear sign of hormonal imbalance, exactly what the little kiddies have."
Is there something wrong at the Day Care Centre?,There's something wrong in your pants.
"Oh... She's a lot younger than I am, I... use a male enhancement cream to keep up with her. What does this have to do with...",NEver occurred to you to get a prescription instead of some penis pumper loaded with testosterone?
I keep it at the gym. I apply it daily in the shower just like it says on the bottle. It's nEver been in my home. It's obviously nEver been near the kids.,But you have.
We've been through that I'm not a pervert or a paedophile.,30% of our waste is excreted through our skin.
So... I did this to them? House nods. Just holding their hands?,Uh-huh.
If I stop using it?,"You'll be floppy, they'll be fine. Looks at Jasper teasing Lucy by not letting her get her bunny. He'll still be eight. Pops a pill."
"You'll be floppy, they'll be fine. Looks at Jasper teasing Lucy by not letting her get her bunny. He'll still be eight. Pops a pill.",Takes off his glasses. You ok?
"Yeah, I think so.",Puts the magazine down. Talk to Cuddy?
"No, not yet! Takes his hands off his face. I don't know what to say.",Just... be straight with her.
I'm not sure what that is. I... I can't stop thinking about her.,Trying not to smile. In what way?
"Maybe she's right, maybe... maybe this is worth exploring?",Still trying fairly successfully to keep a straight face. You sure she feels...
She sent me flowers! How do I do this? What do I say?,"Cameron would tell you to say how you feel. Me, I'd get her drunk."
"Thinks. I'm not going to say anything. I'm just going to walk into her office, and I'm going to kiss her. Slaps his hand as if to say 'and that's that.'",Struggling to keep a straight face he has to cover his mouth with his hand.
"Yeah. I mean I'll either get a girlfriend or get fired. Looks at House, he doesn't say anything. Ok... yea... ok... Gets up and leaves, House almost bursts out laughing while Wilson is on his way out. Once Wilson is gone he goes to take a sip of his coffee. Suddenly Wilson bursts back in, pointing at him You, you, you! You were going to let me do that?!",Laughs. Well you made a compelling argument.
YOU sent those flowers to me!,"Yes, because, you took her to a play Wilson throws his arms up in the air. because actually you do want to march down there and kiss her."
No! I don't!,Yes you do.
Sighs. You're right.,Shocked. Seriously?
No. House smiles. You're a jerk. Wilson leaves.,Night Wilson.
I don't get the whole May - December thing.,"Give him a break, it's May - October at worst."
Well why can't it be October - October?,May is when things start to get hot.
Laughs. If that guy wasn't trying so hard to keep up with a women half his age he wouldn't have almost killed both his kids.,"Guy gets a little something-something, couple of kids have to die, circle of life."
"So Many people, so much energy and drama just trying to find someone who's almost nEver the right person anyway. It just... shouldn't be so hard.",Long pause. I got tickets to a play...
"Unemployment. And before that I sold subscriptions on the phone. And before that, unemployment. Before that I worked in Jeans Gone Wild. Before that, unemployment. Before that I walked dogs. Before that!",Loss of free will. I like it. Maybe we can get Thomas Aquinas in for a consult. What caused the T.I.A.?
"You're wasting my time he's wasting my! All three finally notice that House isn't paying any attention to them, and is in fact walking toward Wilson's office.",Second ex-Mrs. Wilson wanting money?
"I am no longer paying alimony she wanted her independence, so she got her realtor's license.","Market's doing badly, she wants money."
"Market's doing badly, she's moving into a condo.",She wants
She wants me to take Hector.,Pool boy?
Pool boy? Dog.,No longer interested.
"We got him on our Honeymoon, so I'm like! other parent. But I can't take him! My hotel doesn't allow dogs, besides! I'm always here.",I asked Cuddy to a play Thursday. Wilson laughs.
"Oh, you! okay.",She said she was busy.
"And you didn't beliEve her, so you bribed a janitor, broke into her computer, checked her appointments",I asked her as a test.
What would you have learned if she'd said yes?,"A lot about bondage. She's busy for me, but not for you. She's not interested in the play qua play, she's interested in you."
"No. I'm not getting sucked into the vortex of your insanity again. Don't pass me notes in class, don't tell me to ask her to the prom",You cannot see her socially. You're leading her on!
"I'll consider that after I take her to the Hockney exhibit. On Thursday. See, she is busy. It's not a date. House stares at him. She enjoyed the play. I enjoyed her enjoying the play. The Woman works hard, it's nice to see her relax.",So all this enjoying is an act of charity?
I'm keeping the receipts for tax purposes.,What's life without the ability to make stupid choices?
"You'd like that, wouldn't you, when your dad asked you out for dinner. I'll do the tests, you're stuck with the family.",You like Hockney?
You heard about that?,"Hot stuff, were the Venezuelan pictures."
That's a trick question.,"Yes, but you have no idea how it's a trick."
I like art. I'm open to new things. What's the pRoblem?,"You're going to a gallery to see Venezuelan pictures that don't exist, but you won't go to a play with me. Why?"
"House, why is my social life suddenly red-hot? One minute I'm mushing along with the huskies as usual, and all of a sudden it's global warming. You think you saw someone pick up a toy from the sandbox and suddenly you want it.",Is that why you said no?
Maybe I just want a friend and Wilson is a safe choice.,I'm not safe? Cool. Wilson is nEver a safe choice.
"Going to a gallery, we're not getting married.","Sure, you say that now. He always marries them in the end!"
Biopsy shows there are white blood cells in the walls of the blood vessels.,They're not supposed to get past the bouncers.
"It's got to be autoimmune, something lymposidic. White blood cells are attacking her own body.",The only question is what kind of autoimmune.
Doesn't matter what kind.,It always matters what kind.
Treatment is always steroids.,Treatment is always boring! Diagnosis is
"Okay. It's affecting the larger blood vessels, so it's gotta be giant cell arteritis. I'll start her on steroids. It's affecting her smaller blood vessels, it's gotta be lupus vasculitis. I'll start her on steroids. It's affecting","Yeah, got it. Start her on steroids."
Good idea. He leaves.,Told you. That was boring. I gotta go out.
I gotta go out. Why?,Wilson's got a date.
"It's got 15 foot ceilings, an open floor plan!. You know, I can't beliEve you called me.","Hey, I need a condo. Didn't you and Wilson have your first date around here?"
"Wow, you remember where our first date was? I didn't think you were paying attention.",Really? He's my best friend.
Our first date was in Boston.,Oh. Not quite as close to here as I remembered.
But we're not here to talk about him.,Absolutely not.
Wait 'till you see the kitchen. All granite countertops!,"Since I wasn't paying attention back then, what was it like dating him?"
"Oh, it was nEver a date. I was coming off a bad relationship and he said we could go out as friends, you know, go see plays, go to a museum. I didn't think you liked Trenton.","Love it. So he'd say it's not a date, but then he'd jump you."
"Oh no, he meant it. Wilson, carefully calibrating his lEvel of protectiveness for your individual needs.",Did you just compare Wilson to a tampon?
"It's like walking into a sticky trap. Once you're the focus of all that attention, it's addictive. This unit's kitchen's got a chef's oven.",I cook a lot. Go on.
"It's the emotional stuff that really sucks you in. He's just so knight-in-shining armor, you know? Always there to support you, until he's not, but by then you're hooked. Hey, do you think you could talk to him about taking the dog? He's the only one that Hector really gets along with.","Hey hey, we're here to talk real estate, not Wilson. So you're saying if you actually had sex before you connected emotionally, you'd have gotten over it."
"Oh yeah, it seems weird, doesn't it? Because sex with James is fantastic. Nobody works harder to give a Woman what she wants. It's got six burners. The chef's oven.",Right.
"Okay. Suppose Chase and Cameron are right. Suppose it's an autoimmune disease. What's the biggest danger of total body radiation? It suppresses the immune system, which is what we're trying to do with the steroids anyway!","I don't usually put out on the first date, but I gotta say, that is a rad move. Get her consent. Start the radiation."
The Patient is not too thrilled with me.,I'll get her consent.
"Foreman's got a personality issue, so you're going to step in?",Patient doesn't like Foreman. I'm interested.
Patient doesn't like Foreman. I'm interested.,"Fatigue, hair loss, possibility of damage to the lungs, infertility. All possible side effects of radiation. Why don't you like Dr. Foreman?"
He thinks he's better than he is.,How good is he?
I don't know. Can we get back to what's wrong with me?,There's a small possibility of leukemia some time in the future. Hardly worth mentioning. You can't say he's better than he is if you don't know how good he is.
No one's as good as he thinks he is.,I am. You might also get cataracts. Sign here.
I don't know. You're telling me how dangerous this is.,We're saving your life. We're that good. Sign there.
I can't decide.,"Would you rather a pencil or a pen? Who's the better James Bond, Sean Connery or Daniel Craig? Now, you see, that's not Even a decision."
Bonnie called last night to talk about the dog. Your name came up.,"Good lord, how do you still have teeth?"
"She's the worst realtor in New Jersey. What is this, escalation? I go out with Cuddy, you hook up with my ex? I don't Even know what that's designed to do.",You're an addict. I'm saving you from yourself.
"By condo shopping, thank you.","If I can figure out where you keep going wrong, then I can nip this Cuddy thing in the bud before she becomes the fourth ex-Mrs. Wilson."
"Yes, I was worried there was no way to stop that train.",You have to have sex with Cuddy.
Wait! to stop the train? House nods. Bonnie said quietly I'm bad in bed?,loudly Huh?!
"I told her you were wasting her time, by the way.",You think that's going to stop her? The Woman's the worst realtor in New Jersey.
That's not cancer. It sounds like!,It sounds like she's septic.
A lot of things can cause pain.,How much?
But she had no fEver. Her LP was clear.,"Do an echo to confirm it's in her heart, and then I'll tell our Patient that we just killed her."
"Oh, great. You haven't been returning my phone calls.",I'm busy.
"Well, um, but if you have half an hour this afternoon, I just found this unit, it hasn't been on the market yet",I'm off the market for condos.
James was right. I nEver had the teeniest chance of selling you anything.,Of course he was right. He doesn't stop giving good advice just because you're divorced. He's compulsive about remaining on good terms with his exes.
Do you want to know why I named that dog Hector?,No. Let's keep it a mystery.
"Because Even when he was a puppy, he was the worst-tempered dog we'd Ever seen he. He was supposed to be House-trained, but he'd pee on the carpet Every morning. When we had people over, he would nip at their ankles. Hector does go rug is an anagram for Doctor Greg House that's how early in the marriage I resented you.",Wow. Did I Ever waste money on that place setting.
James at least had the decency to feel guilty when he hurt me!,"Whereas I nEver hurt you! I nEver Even married you, clEverly hoping to avoid moments like this one."
"You always needed him, and he was always there for you!","You keep yelling, and I'll think you owe me sex."
"You knew he had a wife waiting at home, you didn't care. I'm not saying you broke up the marriage, but you didn't help.","First, Hector does go rug is a lame anagram."
What are you doing?,Prepping for an aspiration. We still don't know what infection
It's not going to help her.,"It's not going to hurt her. Well, it is going to hurt her, but"
"Well, it is going to hurt her, but No.","This will just take a few minutes. Grab a piece of an abscess, some pus"
You really don't care.,You really don't care why she's going to be dead.
She's going to be dead,"WHAT? What did we screw up, what did we miss? I need to know."
Aren't you Ever gonna leave? No.,Yeah?
I got your consent.,Her bra hook.
Her bra hook. What?,She scratched herself with her bra hook. That's how the infection got in. Staph aureus.
She died from a simple Staph infection?,That and some bad decisions.
I'll be outside.,"Go home, have a few drinks, go to sleep, get up tomorrow, and do it tomorrow, only better."
I killed her.,"Yeah, me too."
"This wasn't, oh, I should have thought of that idea sooner. This wasn't messing up a dosage. We see a disease rushing down on someone like a train, we can't always get them out of the way. But this wasn't that.",No.
So you're giving me numbers?,"Because they don't lie. I can't forgive you, Foreman, because there's nothing to forgive. He leaves."
What'd you tell him?,That guilt is irrelevant.
You wanna get something to eat? They get into the elevator.,Can't. I've got a dog waiting at home.

Hector's my dog. He's about sEventeen.,SEventeen? That's like...a hundred and nineteen in huMan years. Why's he still alive?
Blood panel was negative for all the usual suspects.,That's 'cause the infection is too small.

We drove the infection into his heart.,Okay.
Remove the valve? He'll be fine on antibiotics. He doesn't need open heart surgery.,He'll be heart-broken on account of his dead brother.
"Either way, he's got a dead brother. The infection isn't just in the valve. Even with targeted medication, there's no way we can clear his system in time.","We don't have to.

into phone He's stoned. I'll be right in.,"Cut all the way into this kid's heart, and all we got was this lousy, non-infectious fibrous tissue."
Matty had a fEver. Got sicker when we suppressed his immune system. That all points to,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",Not our fault. Fibrous tissue! Something is turning his healthy heart valve to gristle.
hopeful Autoimmune diseases aren't passed along in bone marrow. He can still donate. We,Lupus and Behets are our best bet. Do an ANA and a pathergy test.
Or... it could be infection.,"My memory's not what it used to be, but didn't we just rule that out eight seconds ago?"
Just because it's not what screwed up his valve doesn't mean it's not in his system.,"Uh-huh, and it has the obvious advantage of making us right all along. A little disadvantage of making big brother dead."
That's your argument? Better outcome?,pointedly It fits.
The family has one kid with leukemia and one with autoimmune. Wouldn't stand next to them in a rainstorm.,That's your argument? It sucks for them?

"Bronchoscopy was pristine, so much for the lungs.",Comes back out. Good morning.
"Which means no ulcer or GI bleed. Which means it's not from her stomach, either. Which means it didn't come from anywhere.",Comes back out. You guys get to the point where the blood didn't come from anywhere?
"Rupture in her sinus cavity, dripped through the back.",Not that much blood.
Trauma from karate?,No trauma. She kicked the other guy's ass.
Now a good time?,If you can tell me how blood can mysteriously appear in a!
What's going on?,Closing the door. Feel free to speculate amongst yourselves.
Yeah. Why?,He's afraid of turning into me.
Good luck. Thank you.,That's it? You're not going to tell him that we're a family and families don't abandon each other?
You want me to?,No.
"Good luck, Dr. Foreman. Hugs Foreman then leaves.","So, where were we?"
College sophomore coughing up blood.,"Not the case, the speculation. The palace intrigue. The rising self-doubts. Did Foreman get a promotion?"
I resigned. What?,Personally I can't beliEve I've had the same three employees for three years.
Patient could have a heart pRoblem.,Yes. Life goes on. Look at the eager beaver combing his hair.
"Hyperdynamic heart could force too much blood into her lungs, she coughed up the overflow. Wouldn't leave a trace in her lungs because it's travelling through normal plumbing.","Foreman, go do a stress echo test to see if he's right."
What? A brain pRoblem? Messed up hypothalamus could cause goose bumps but they're not going to cause her to cough up blood. She has no neurological issues. She had a shiver.,I think there's an infection.
"We've ruled out infection because no fEver, no white count. They stop in front of Wilson's office.",I think there's an infection.
Why's Foreman quitting?,He wants to breed llamas. Starts to walk towards Wilson's office.
"Interesting. House turns around. You're ashamed of the reason, too. House smiles and continues on his way, Chase leaves in the direction Foreman did.",Takes the coffee and sits down. No one writes tamoxifen like you.
"Well, I use a G.",Foreman resigned.
Stops writing. I'm sorry.,It's okay. No biggie.
Rolls his eyes. Right. He give a reason?,He said he didn't want to end up like me. I had a brilliant retort. Can't remember what it was at the moment.
You don't want to end up like you.,Good point. Can I resign? Wilson yawns. What's up with that?
What's up with that? With what?,You yawned.
"My heart's fine, I was up late. You're just deflecting having a conversation about Foreman.",I'm ok with Foreman leaving.
"Either you're lying, or you don't really think he's leaving, or you just jumped right to acceptance. House yawns.",Sorry. I yawned because I was trying to communiCate boredom.
"You could try bargaining with him, give him a raise.",How much do you think it would cost to make him want to be like me? Silence. Thanks for the coffee. Leaves.
She seems fine.,She is fine.
She coughed up blood.,Past tense.
She has diarrhoea.,From the antibiotics for the infection.
Lung biopsy says she doesn't have an infection.,"Well, then, you screwed up the biopsy."
Or you're wrong about infection.,"Well if I'm wrong, then so is her body, because it obviously thinks she's got an infection or it wouldn't have gotten better from the antibiotics."
Does this have anything to do with Addie?,Lets say yes.
"Cerebral tumour, epilepsy! Could also be a medication reaction to antidepressants or some meds for end stage liver failure.",Lets say no.
"But now you are? No, now you're nervous, uncomfortable about your decision. It wasn't Even that good a joke.",Oh crap.
Most of your jokes are excellent. Cameron rolls her eyes. I just meant in comparison.,Shut up. I think she may not have an infection. You better deal with her before she crashes.
"Heart was fine, liver enzymes were normal.",Looking at the chart.
Labs indiCated minute traces of blood.,"Can't ignore the blood because it's a minority, can you, Foreman?"
"If we count the traces of blood as significant, the differential isn't just infection. It could be lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma.","Great. Go tell her she's got one of those. Or you could tell her we haven't given her enough antibiotics for her INFECTION. Double the dose, and check her lungs."
"We checked her lungs, they're clean.",Leaving. On the outside. She needs an arteriogram.
It's about my bowel movements.,"What isn't, these days? Shuts the door. Points to Steve's girlfriend, Honey. You sure you want to be here for this?"
We do Everything together.,"Of course. The toilet can be a lonely place. Drop your pants, I'll suit up."
Dropping his pants. They float.,Huh?
I'm a nutritionist. Smiles.,"Yes, I could tell from the cool toe-loop sandals."
"Yes, I could tell from the cool toe-loop sandals. Thank you.",You're welcome. They smile at each other. And the natural fibre clothing I assume means some kind of vegetarian denomination?
We're vegans. At first I was a little concerned about the lack of protein but Honey showed me you can get it from lots of...,"Well, whatEver floats your poop. And you've been together how long? 6 months?"
How'd you know?,Because after 6 months poop love fades and if you've been together shorter than that then... I'll explain right after this break. Leaves.
Because after 6 months poop love fades and if you've been together shorter than that then... I'll explain right after this break. Leaves.,Three 10-milligram pills of your finest amphetamines. Signs the book.
Which means her lungs are fine.,What if the clear arteriogram is significant?
It is significant. It means there's no infection.,I think there's an infection.
"Infections don't come and go, people don't get better then worse on the same treatment.",Unless her body can't finish off the fight maybe goes a couple of rounds then gives up.
Why would it give up?,Maybe its name is Foreman.
Blood panel and enzymes show her proteins are normal.,"You can't have tested for Every protein, I can think of at least one you can't test for at all."
Complement factor-H deficiency. But if she has that she's dead. No way to fend off bacteria. She'll get one infection after another until her body shuts down.,Maybe we can get ahead of the game. Manage each symptom as it comes up. Give her five miserable years instead of six miserable months.
There's no diagnostic test for complement factor-H deficiency.,So we isolate the cells that are yummiest for it.
"What? No, I'm not.","Oh, yes you are."
Looks disappointed. It's ok. I get it.,"Confused. Well I was going to say relax but, oddly enough, you seem pretty relaxed already."
You're accomplished. You're funny. You can have whatEver you want. Women are going to...,"He's not cheating with another Woman, he's cheating with another food group."
"He's not cheating with another Woman, he's cheating with another food group. Angry. What?",His floaters float because they're full of fat. PRobably had a big cheeseburger for lunch.
"Soy cakes taste like cardboard, unsalted cardboard.",I'm accomplished. I'm funny. Can I have whatEver I want? Steve is shocked. Honey smiles.
"Addie this all looks really scary, but you'll feel nothing, ok? Ok.",You rang?
You called me.,I bought you an espresso.
Suspicious. How did you walk with the cane and the two coffees?,Laughs. Why are you suspicious?
"Because it's either that, or accept the fact that you've done something nice. And then I have to deal with the horsemen and the rain of fire and the end of days.","Laughs again. What, you think I spat in yours?"
"What, you think I spat in yours? Or worse.",I stacked them.
"I stacked them. Puts the left one on top of the right and lifts it up to demonstrate, then puts the left one down again and holds out the right one to Wilson.","What do you think of me hiring a nutritionist instead of a neurologist? I mean, they sound almost the same."
I take it you've met a hot nutritionist.,Don't cheapen this. We had an in-depth conversation about proteins and fats. I was about to examine her boyfriend's rectum.
You asked for a date while your finger was in her boyfriend?,Got her number.
"No, no. No way. House pulls out a piece of paper and hands it to Wilson. This is an employment application. She doesn't want to go out with you she's looking for a job. Oh, God. She's 26.",But with the wisdom of a much younger Woman.
Have you spoken to Foreman?,SEveral times. We laugh...
You're going to lose him.,"And that will be depressing. But it will only make me appreciate all the good things that I do have. House goes into the Diagnostics Office, Wilson leaves."
Which means we should be looking for a tumour.,I think there's an infection. Just because the cells in her eye aren't dead yet doesn't mean they're working.
So why did we do the test.,Because if it had been positive it would have proved I was right.
But negative doesn't prove you wrong.,Smiling. That's the beauty of the test.
She needs an MRI of her brain.,"Absolutely. Ducklings start to leave. As long as you're scanning, you mind having a boo for an abscess or something caused by an infection? Ducklings leave."
My head. Starts screaming. Cameron gets her out of the maParkne. My head! The camera pans round to rEveal her head. Open. Bleeding. We can see her brain.,Grody.
Looks like massive tissue death.,Who cares? Her head blew up. How cool is that?
It's not pusy.,"Turns the camera on Cameron. Meaning you don't think it's an infection, and you'd be right, if you weren't wrong. Puts the camera back on the open head."
Here we go again.,"She's got infections that come and go, which means..."
It means it has to be something else!,"Good guess, but no!"
You enjoying this?,I'm saving a Woman's life.
An autoimmune pRoblem makes more sense.,You can't explain transudative pleural effusion with giant cell arteritis. You'd need three whiteboards and 100 different coloured markers.
"If it's autoimmune she can live, but we have to give her steroids, now, before her heart ruptures.","If you're wrong, and you give her steroids, she dies, now."
Takes a deep breath. Ready.,My Patient's about to have a heart attack. Smiles. It's going to be massive!
Oh well that's too bad cause I just got tickets to a stroke on the third floor. Have you had a conversation with Foreman?,Pulls out some money. Can you do me a favour?
"You haven't, because then you would have to confront your own emotions.",Is bile an emotion?
You dosed me!,"Yes... I did, but only because you didn't trust me! Your best friend."
Walks in You could have killed me!,Amphetamines aren't going to kill you. Shuts the door.
You don't know my medical history! I c-c-c-c... I could've... You could've given me a heart attack.,"Laughs. Well, a heart attack is not going to kill you. You were in a hospital. Wilson yawns. Aha! You yawned!"
Aha! You tried to kill me.,I put you on uppers and you still yawned.
I'm not on antidepressants I'm on SPEEEEEED!,Well that means it's a symptom of a cerebral tumour.
It's not a secret. House it's-it's... it's personal!,How long has it been personal?
How long has it been personal? It's personal!,Yawning's recent so! either you just started or you changed prescription.
Holds out his hands. This is why I take them.,"They're antidepressants, not anti-annoyance-ants. You'd think this would naturally come up in conversation with..."
Oh don't act hurt. You don't care!,On one of those occasions when you're pompously lecturing me on what to do to fix my life.
"You wouldn't take them! You'd rather OD on Vicodin or stick electrodes in your head, because you can say you did it to get high. The only reason to take antidepressants is because you're depressed. You! you have to admit that you're depressed.",Give me. Holds out his hand.
Are you going to admit that...,Nope. I'm going to prove that I'm not depressed.
Haha. Shakes his head... Well I can't give you my prescription. You've got to meet with a psyParkatrist. You need a whole work up. Breathing heavily. Give me a Vicodin so I don't stroke. House chucks him the bottle. Wilson pops a pill. And grabs a coffee cup off the side table.,I! wouldn't drink that. Wilson stares at him. My leg hurt and I! points towards the bathroom. Wilson puts the cup down.
House. House is startled awake. Why didn't you pick up the phone? We've been calling.,I was sleeping.
What did you do?,Nothing! This is how regular people look when you wake them up.
Hemolytic uremic syndrome shut down Addie's kidneys. Peripheral smear of red cells had sParkstocytes.,Huh.
"Doesn't mean you're right. You predicted cardiac arrest, INSTANT cardiac arrest.","There were only two choices, since yours was wrong, mine must have been right. Either that or we missed the leprechaun."
"If you're right then there's nothing to be done. The steroid treatment we gave her means when the next infection hits it'll hit hard. Liver failure, cardiac arrest.","But on the bright side, it confirms my diagnosis."
She's going to die.,"That's not my fault. She was going to die anyway. Now, thanks to me, at least she'll know why."
I'm sure you'll see that gratitude in her eyes when you tell her.,I'm not telling her.
I'm not telling her.,No one's telling her. Not until we're sure I'm right.
But we're going to wait for her to stroke or have a heart attack to confirm before we tell her?,Seems like the huMane approach. Leaves and goes into his office.
"Her heart went into V-fib. Brought her back, barely. Congratulations, you have your confirmation. House gets up and starts to leave, presumably to tell Addie she is going to die. Foreman calls out after him. What's her name?",Who? The co-ed?
The co-ed? Sure.,Thinks. Dead sophomore girl?
You know her father's name?,Dad. Her mother's name is Mommy.
"Ben and Jodie are about to lose their only daughter, Addie.",You think they're going to give a crap if I know their names?
You saying you don't want me to quit?,Didn't sound like I said that.
"You are about to tell a girl she is dying and you think it's about you. God, I hope I'm not you. Leaves.",I'm sorry. Addie you're dying.
Are you sure?,Yes. Your infections will get worse. The toxins will spill into your blood.
The toxins will spill into your blood. How long?,"Two days, maybe less. You have a condition called..."
Does it matter.,It's a very rare protein deficiency that only...
I don't want to hear it.,Ok.
"Please, could you just leave?","Smiling. What's the point in living,without curiosity? Without craving the..."
Get out of here.,Smiling still. It's-it's-it's like the... dark matter in the universe...
dark matter in the universe... You're smiling.,"No I'm not. You can only diagnose a pRoblem by looking at what's... Sees a reflection on himself, smiling. missing... Oh, God. I have to go. Leaves."
Leaves. Startled. Ahh.,"Loudly. 19-year-old didn't want to hear the coolest explanation of why she's going to die. Shuts the door, loudly. Begged me to shut up. Turns the light on."
If you can't shut up at least talk quietly.,Amphetamine withdrawal's a bitch. She thought that I was happy.
Sits up. You were happy?,No!
I told you. You got to be checked out by...,"No, you just didn't want me double dosing. Wilson starts looking guilty. He knows the game's up. You dosed me! Those coffees..."
"They worked! You've been smiling, relaxed, happy!",A dying girl thought I was happy. A moron thought I was happy. Who the hell doesn't want to know why she's dying?
House was happy.,Hazy.
Hazy. Happy.,Hazy!
"Oh, right. A dying girl mistook hazy for happy, because dying people see happiness Everywhere. She's miserable.",She wasn't miserable.
Of course she was miserable you just told her she was...,She was no different then she's Ever been.
"She was no different then she's Ever been. Epiphany. She was no different than she'd Ever been.... Oh, God. I got to go. Leaves and slams the door behind him, much to the dismay of Wilson who cringes and rubs his face.",Need a minute with your daughter.
Dr. House get out of here before...,She's going to live. Does that help? Now get out.
Are you jerking us around?,Get out!
"I'm dying, I'm not depressed.",Wrong and wrong.
Starts to cry. Can you fix me?,Surgery to fix the bridge will take about 2 hours. Psychotherapy is going to take a little longer. Why'd you do it?
"I don't know. I've just! nEver been happy. Crying. Please don't tell my parents. They'll blame themselves and it's not their fault. Please, you can't tell them.","Technically, all you have to do is promise me that you wont do it again. Then, legally I can't tell them."
Composes herself. I promise.,"Yeah, sure."
We can't thank you...,Your daughter tried to kill herself.
"Which makes sense, she's obviously an adult, capable of her own well-reasoned decisions. You're sure?","If she doesn't die in the next couple of hours, yeah, I'm right."
How could she hide this?,Everyone has secrets.
"We'll take care of her, figure it out.",You'll make her happy?
We'll get her into therapy.,"Nods. Might want to try some meds, too. Starts to leave."
Follows him. Can we call you? House turns around. If we have any questions? Smiles.,No. Jodie is shocked. House leaves.
I didn't think you were going to show.,Sorry. Surgery went a little late.
So you really think I have all the necessary qualifications?,I can't discuss this with a dry mouth. What have you got there?
What have you got there? Peppermint tea.,To the barMan. I'm going to have a mug of peppermint tea please.
"This isn't a job interview, is it?","It's some kind of interview. You're judging me, I'm judging you."
You have the upper hand. I don't know anything about you.,I'm on antidepressants because a doctor friend of mine thinks I'm miserable.
You don't seem depressed.,You do realise you just skipped over sEveral deep character flaws that most women would run screaming from?
You told the truth.,"Yeah... I don't always do that, either."
"Well, how miserable can you be saving lives, sleeping around and doing drugs? Smiles.","Were you on the Debating team in high school? BarMan pours House's tea. Also... Picking it up. I hate tea. Drinks it, then smiles."
I hate this... kid.,I like this kid.
You haven't met him.,I know you hate him.
Nate went mEdieval on the other kid. Could be...,Hold on. closing his eyes I'm having a moment. This... imitates choking back a sob this could be Foreman's last time mistakenly suggesting adrenal gland tumor.
Which could create excess adrenaline. Causes the head pain and rage.,But not the personality disorder.
There is no personality disorder. He's a teenager.,"Being a teenager excuses the odd inappropriate comment. This kid say anything appropriate? announcing He's having cluster headaches. PRobably been having them for years. Question is, what's causing them?"
"If it were just a cluster headache, he'd have swelling around the eyes.",ER gave him ibuprofen for the pain. Useless for this pain. It could have knocked down the swelling. Best bet is a vascular pRoblem.
"reads a file Normal treatment for cluster headaches is steroids, which the ER also gave him. He's still in pain. Which means...",turns around Normal treatment is called normal treatment because sometimes you have to use abnormal treatment. Start him on blood thinners and give his noggin Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.
turns around Normal treatment is called normal treatment because sometimes you have to use abnormal treatment. Start him on blood thinners and give his noggin Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation.,Don't you dare... touch that acerbic wit.
shrugging I thought I was a bad mother. And I hated myself. Because I hated him.,vo What do you got for me this...
vo What do you got for me this...,... fine morning?
Blood thinners and TMS had no effect. It's not cluster headaches.,You accusing the symptoms of lying?
Could be hemochromatosis.,Wouldn't account for the personality disorder.
What about hypothyroidism?,"He's not getting aggressive and lethargic, he's getting aggressive and aggressiver."

Does Foreman actually think I did that?,"No, just me. But I know something he doesn't. I didn't do it."
Why would I do it?,Do you want him to leave?
Do you want him to leave? No.,Were you planning on doing something?

I was being sarcastic.,Wouldn't look that way in the court transcript. Mushrooms have psilocybins that work on cluster headaches. It's either that or cutting into his brain and going on a fishing expedition.

What are you going to do to keep him?,Nothing.
"He really is going to leave, you know that right?",Yeah.
So what are you going to do?,"Nothing I can do. He doesn't want more money, better working conditions, doesn't Even want a better job. He wants to not be me."
Because he thinks you're a cold-hearted bastard without any regard for anyone but yourself.,He's right. bites into a bun

"He doesn't really want to leave, and you don't really want to let him. You'll cave, just like you did with Cameron.","Foreman's not as easy as Cameron, but of course, who is?"
He may not want a date but he does want... something.,Maybe it's something I can't offer.
Then you'll just lie.,He'd see through it.
"We could do that, or we could do something productive, start her on interferon for the MS, see if she improves.","I do like being productive. Well done, do it."
Well done? Is that what you think he wants? A pat on the head?,Go do your job.
"Does this hurt? he experimentally twists her arm and ends up breaking her wrist, she screams in pain","Wow. Well either Foreman's way stronger than he thinks he is or... he turns around, the ducklings are silent seriously or?"
Cancer's a long shot.,"Why? Because metastatic tumours don't explain the abnormal MRI, kidney damage, cotton mouth, double vision? Oh wait, they do."
Infection could do all that too.,It's not an infection.
Because you know the non-existent medical records confirm that the brilliant doctors in Cuba treated her for infection? Or because you're trying to kiss up to Foreman?,Because an infection would cause a fEver and the brilliant doctors who work in my office have already crossed that off the list because the husband--
"Right, and then you said we should do something productive like breaking her arm?",Foreman didn't break her arm.
Of course he didn't.,"Cancer did. Put her on a PET scan, see what else is breaking. He prepares to walk out of the room"
"This isn't going to work! He's not a moron, you can't just agree with Everything he says for two days and hope he forgets the last three years and how much he hates you!","Anything else? When you get the results for the PET scan, let me know."
I don't really care if Foreman stays or goes but--,You're fired.
Wha... what because I yelled at you?,"Because you've been here the longest, learned all you can, or you haven't learned anything at all... either way, it's time for a change."
Why'd you fire Chase?,"Sure thing, first you tell me the results of the PET scan."
Did you fire him for me?,Would you stay if I did?
You asked him to fire Chase? No!,Yes.
You're frustrated with Foreman so you lash out? Kick the dog?,He's not gone 5 minutes and the name-calling starts. What's on the PET scan?
walks in Why'd you fire Chase?,Do you know what's on the PET scan?
You two out. they exit,"Woah, wait! What's on the PET scan?"
You can't dump your entire department just because you don't know how to deal with an issue.,"Yes, they are all irreplaceable. If only this country had figured out somehow to teach people to interpret PET scans."
bursts in What the hell is wrong with you? You fired Chase?,I don't suppose you know what's on my Patient's PET scan?
"I told you to show Foreman you have a heart, how does that translate to you being a bastard?",So that's a no?
"Pick up the phone, and tell Chase you made a mistake. Un-fire him.","reluctantly picks up the phone and dials Chase. If you know what's on the PET scan, call me back. put the phone back down"
Chase is a good doctor.,"Sorry, you're in the wrong room. My name on the door, my team, my decisions."

She has no pulse but she's talking. Cough.,"Cough again. Keep coughing, it'll push blood into your head, keep you conscious. She obeys, Foreman is trying to help start her heart again through CPR Push 1 mg epinephrine."
Will cough that cough help?,"No, but it is amazingly cool."
We need to put her on bypass.,"We need to keep her here, if this is a clot then forcing a bypass will blow it into her brain and kill her."
If we continue CPR she'll lose blood flow which will cause brain damage.,What would cause the heart to stop? Let's assume it wasn't huMan error. looks at Foreman

HuMan error is the only other possible--,It's not huMan error.
"he finally turns around to face House on the monitor Of course it's huMan error, you don't want Foreman to have made a mistake because then you'd have to mock him, and that would put a crimp in your brilliant plan of keeping him by having a breakdown and firing Chase.",Did you just spin on the monitor? You know I can't see you. Wilson turns back to the surgery looking perplexed HuMan error would not explain her symptoms.

gets up I will miss you. he hugs her,walks in Can I have a hug too?
We can stay. We can run another differential.,"You two have no theories about why the heart stopped. Which means I don't need you, go."
It's too late for theories we need to tell the husband.,Tell him what?
That it's over.,Why?
Because her heart won't start!,How can we tell him there's no hope if we don't know why there's no hope?
If he pulls the plug it means you failed.,And you're ok with that? Go.

looks good. Thank you.,"If you're here to yell at me about the Foreman-Chase situation, it can wait."
When do you plan on telling the husband it's time to say goodbye to his wife?,Haven't put a clock on it.
"Other than your curiosity, do you have any reason to keep her on bypass?",Patient's husband prefers her not dead.
Well you're on a storybook ending for the young Man who crossed the ocean for his wife.,"This is not an act, I don't care if--"
Then pull the plug.,What if I can fix it? Maybe I just don't know it yet.
I know you care--,I don't care.
You've done all you can do. It's time to let go. she walks out,I was told you didn't beliEve in God.

It's impossible. Apparently not.,Live hearts don't stop for no reason. Dead hearts don't start for no reason.
walks in She's 3 hours off bypass and still stable. And the pain is gone.,No it's not.
You think she's lying about feeling better?,Just 'coz it's not there now doesn't mean it's gone.
"Just because it was there before doesn't mean it's coming back. Chase was pRobably right, she had some sort of tropical infection that cleared when we put her on antibiotics during the bypass.",Antibiotics did not bring her back to life.
"Other than a miracle, it's the only explanation for her symptoms.",How come God gets credit whenEver something good happens?

"Not really, Cuddy won't...",I can make you miserable.
I can make you miserable. That's true.,"Until you quit, again. So why don't we just skip the middleMan?"
I'm not quitting.,"My god, not Everything's about you, and your little job, and your little world. This is about restoring order in the universe."
I'm not quitting.,You're going to be miserable.
Doesn't cover all three. What else?,"Carry on, he's the boss. Sits down between 13 and Kutner."
Have to be in the brain stem and it still doesn't explain the lungs.,"Weird, though... That he's the boss. Didn't he quit recently? Was it a money issue?"
"Lungs, stomach, numbness?","No that wasn't it, it was something else... Was it bling account? Med plan didn't cover tattoo removal?"
We have to unify these symptoms.,Oh! I remember. You don't want to turn into me. Right? You didn't want to become evil.
Can we stick to the medicine here?,"Absolutely. I'm just flattered. In a few short weeks, seems like I've just turned towards the light. I mean... either that or you've sold your soul."
Multiple marantic emboli could...,Get a raise?
They run off. You're right.,But?
No but. You're right about all of it.,"Well, then, I'll see you at the reunion. Stands up to leave."
"Okay, while you're killing him... I'll get the intubation kit.",I decided you're right. You're obviously in an impossible position. There's no point in me humiliating you.
There's no point in me humiliating you. Thanks.,"So I'm going to humiliate Cuddy, until she fires you."
Guy's faking. It's Munchausen's. You notice the EMT run sheet? Hands a file to House. Paramedic who brought him in is also named Martin Harris.,"Well. Cole runs past. If the name was Attila Von Weinerschnitzel, I'd say you might be on to something."
"Look. Points to the white board listing all the Patients. Room 406, abdominal pain. Room 403, left-sided numbness. 402, syncope. He's copying his neighbours' symptoms.",Studies the board. No.
"Yeah, coincidence is much more likely than you being a stubborn jerk.","Munchausen's Patients create symptoms, not names."
See? Nothing's wrong with him.,"He's in a lab coat. Munchausen's pretend to be Patients, not doctors. He's got mirror syndrome."
He's got mirror syndrome. Giovannini's?,Do you know another mirror syndrome?
My explanation's simpler.,"Well if it's simple, then we discharge the nut bar. But if it's compliCated, then the nut bar has got brain damage."
So we let him jerk them around for a few days until we're sure?,"No, we let him jerk you around. There's a faster way."
"No, we let him jerk you around. There's a faster way.",Mind if we play through?
"Sure, what could possibly go wrong?","What's going on here, Martin?"
"House, who is this guy?","Excellent question. Who are you, Martin? Patient opens his mouth to talk but says nothing. He just likes to watch, do stuff."
"Number ten scalpel for initial incision. Glad you're here, House.",Of course you are. To the Patient. It's lecture time.
"Yeah, it is. Stop worrying about the power play.","Was that it? I think you can go a lot deeper here. I mean, WHY am I so obsessed by all of this?"
"You're threatened by Foreman and feel the need to impress Cuddy. The only thing that's relevant is Foreman is a good doctor. He can help you, lighten the load.",Good idea. I'll have him sort my mail.
Who is this guy?!,I think we just found out.
I like him. Hah.,Looks up at Foreman in the observation room as the Patient grabs a scalpel. Told you I didn't need you.
"House, what is going on?",Cuts the Patient's hand with a scalpel
Owww! Cut barely bleeds.,"Your blood's turned to sludge. If we don't heat you up, you're going to die. Looks up at Foreman. Can't fake that!"
"Your blood's turned to sludge. If we don't heat you up, you're going to die. Looks up at Foreman. Can't fake that!","Mirror syndrome Patients have no agenda, no axe to grind."
Where are we going?,"Unfortunately, we have to cure him. His hand wasn't black when he came in, the operating room was sterile, the only thing different was the temperature. Cold agglutinins means..."
"No fEver, so it's got to be a tiny infection, hard to find.","You'd better find it fast. This guy feels another cool breeze, his blood turns to slop and he drops. Walks into the cafeteria. I need three ways to pinpoint infection."
I need three ways to pinpoint infection. Blood cultures.,Blood's clumpy. Nothing you can do with it.
Unless we soak him in warm water before we draw it.,"Good, what else?"
"Ultrasound his abdomen, look for an abscess.",Good.
"You're not punishing Cuddy, you're punishing Every doctor in the building.","It's her building, her doctors. Still need one more."
Gets up on the chair. The mayo is fine. You can stay where you are. I'm a doctor.,Mail order. I've seen the diplomas. Two N's in university. Everyone continues to leave. Big Love was right. History's the key.
"No ID, no wallet. No missing persons report filed for a hundred miles.",The key is the key.
The cultures were my idea.,"No one's keeping score... You're losing. To Cole. Search the street where he was mugged, find the car and the registration."
There could be thousands of cars. Why do I get this assignment?,"Because if you deal with the Patient, he's going to wind up singing Osmond songs and proposing to five nurses at once."
"Because if you deal with the Patient, he's going to wind up singing Osmond songs and proposing to five nurses at once.",Ooh. We have a love connection. House leaves.
Lesion on the liver. Cystic or solid?,Solid.
"Well, you certainly did the right thing by coming to me.","Yes, I needed a smug oncologist..."
An authoritative oncologist.,I hate you. Tell me why.
"I've been scanning literature, very interesting study in Sweden. Apparently, Giovannini's Patients mimic whoEver they think's in charge.",Any country with that low an age of consent and that high a rate of suicide isn't thinking straight.
I am in charge of our relationship.,It was a surgery. You were the surgeon. In that setting...
You would pick up my laundry if I asked you to.,"Go ahead, ask."
"Oh, I wouldn't do that to you.",I want all my personal private doctors back right now. Except for Foreman.
"Your team, Foreman included, is dealing with the great mayonnaise panic of 2007. Frankly, I'm worried it might spread to other continents.",Lesion on the liver. Possibility... Why are you doing a pelvic for food poisoning?
She said her hoo hoo burned.,"Lesion on the liver, ideas?"
"Walking past. Unless it's a vascular heMangioma. Aspirate that, he'll bleed out, we'll kill him.",If he bleeds out we'll know what he had.
If he bleeds out we'll know what he had. Had?,Two diagnoses out of three he lives. We do nothing three out of three he dies. To Brennan. Go stick his liver.
Where's Foreman? We should...,You need him to draft your letter of resignation?
You risking our Patient's life to get back at Cuddy?,What?
"I think the black pus is fungal. If I'm right, that's where the cold agglutinins are coming from, that's what's driving his memory loss. Amber's putting him on amphotericin, it will cure him.",This makes no sense.
"I'm doing blood tests to be sure, but the sooner we get him on...",I'm not talking about the infection. I'm talking about you letting Tonya Harding administer the treatment.
I'm out of the game.,Why?
"A couple of weeks ago you named me grumpy, said I didn't want to be here, I wanted to be back in the Third world.",And you realised I'm right just now?
I got a confirmation.,The Patient's nuts.
The Patient's... unbiased. The Patient has no axe to grind.,The Patient is nuts.
"I miss my old life helping people who barely have clean water, let alone the kind of medicines we waste by the SUV load.","You're nuts. You're going to be miserable, at home, at work, somewhere. The goal in life is not to eliminate misery, it's to keep misery to the minimum."
"Oh, that's inspiring.",You said you came back to get married. What does your fiance do?
She's a court reporter.,"Uh-huh, well I'm sure Thailand will have courts any day now. Someone's going to be miserable sometime. Accept it. It's how I stay so happy."
Why do you care if I stay?,You're good. Don't screw it up just because you're miserable.
"Heating blanket wasn't keeping him warm enough. Ordered a whirlpool, got his blood flowing. So far, it's keeping his rash at bay.",Rash worse equals cold agglutinins worse. Means what was in his liver wasn't fungus.
"That it wasn't Even pus, it was just coagulated blood caused by the cold agglutinins.",Which you Points at Brennan mistook for a cool fungus that you saw after the tsunami.
Which you Points at Brennan mistook for a cool fungus that you saw after the tsunami. Same consistency...,"You saw what you wanted to see, not what was there. Wait a second. Didn't you quit?"
"I spoke to my fiance, I'm staying.",Of course you are. Because you're the exact right amount of miserable.
"We could repeat all the cultures, maybe we just missed it.",Or... we can get an accurate history. Dials a number on his phone.
Or... we can get an accurate history. Dials a number on his phone.,"Well, that'll be a good solace to the widow X."
"Well, that'll be a good solace to the widow X.","That's why I sent two of you. One of you breaks in, the other posts bail."
"That's why I sent two of you. One of you breaks in, the other posts bail.","Not a pRoblem. You know how to kill dogs, right?"
"So, back to repeating all the cultures.",Or... we get an accurate history.
Didn't we just rule out that possibility?,You guys Ever heard any of my metaphors yet?
Where were you?,What do you have?
High titers to histoplasmosis.,PRobably lived in the Ohio river valley.
Also weakly positive on coccidiomycosis.,Weak means older. Means he moved to Ohio from the San Joaquin valley.
He's also positive for Chagas disease.,Central America.
Or he kissed his maid from El Salvador. Or he sat next to someone from Belize on a flight to Weehawken or he ate lettuce from Honduras...,"Yes! You're right, buzz kill. This tells us next to nothing. But since that's on the something side of nothing, thought we'd go with it."
His rash is back. Hot tub isn't hot enough to keep his body warm.,So we take his body out of the picture. Let's hit it from the inside. Lipopolysaccharide.
"LPS won't just give him a fEver. He could hit 110, fry his brain.",Or make him just toasty enough to keep his blood flowing free. Like my bowels. You smell that? Not going to get sweeter.
You nailed Brennan for seeing what he wanted to see. You're no different.,But you are.
You want to induce a fEver?,"Unless you're willing to don a white T-shirt and hop into the hot tub with him, I need another way to keep him warm, or he dies."
You could maim him.,I could cure him.
I'm not letting you do it.,Are you going to fire me?
No. House walks away.,Wait a second.
Foreman's not going anywhere.,And... I know when my Vicodin isn't Vicodin. Do you know when your birth control pills aren't birth control pills? Leaves Cuddy looking worried.
Cardiac arrest. We were able to shock him back to a normal sinus rhythm and Kutner nearly into a coma.,So now you've electrocuted yourself and set a Patient on fire. I like the dedication.
It wasn't a compliment.,"Yeah, it was."
Anybody think we should discuss which infection is causing the cold agglutinins before they stop his heart again?,"Sure, why not?"
Nothing on the blood cultures.,Do them again. Quadruple run time. Everyone starts to get up.
"Yeah, yeah... We biopsy his toe instead!","No! That's a terrible idea. Won't tell us anything. Biopsy his heart. Come on, I'll join you."
"No! That's a terrible idea. Won't tell us anything. Biopsy his heart. Come on, I'll join you.",I got you a job. Mount Zion hospital in Boston.
They have a great diagnostics department.,Gilchrist said he'd take you anyway.
That was... Very nice of you.,"Oh, god."
What? The exit the elevator.,Doesn't matter.
Are you saying? What does you having sex with...,Starts Monday. I could help you pack.
I don't want the job. House stops walking.,What? Why not? You're miserable.
You're miserable. Apparently not.,"Well, you're gonna be. Foreman smiles. Are you smiling?"
Are you smiling? No.,Do your own stupid biopsy.
Here's Everything he had in his trunk and in his glove box.,Looks inside the box. No need for the heart biopsy. I now know exactly who he is and what he has. You saved his life.
You saved his life. Really?,"No, you idiot. It's vapour rub and lunch receipts."
"We have his name. We can find his doctor, get his medical records.",It's 800 at night.
"It's 800 at night. The biopsy will be faster. Not fast enough to save him, but that's hardly the point. 13 and Cole start to leave. Thirteen. They both turn around. To Cole. Is your name Thirteen? Cole leaves. Why did you volunteer to go street walking?",A black Mormon could help that way.
A black Mormon could help that way. There's no reason for you to want to be there. Which means there's a reason you didn't want to be here. Didn't want to look in the mirror?,Hi.
Hi. Cuddy called. She needs you to iron her shirts. We'll take over. Pushes 13 forward. Go ahead. Motions for Foreman to leave. He does so. 13 moves close to the Patient while still putting her gloves on. Talk to him.,Come on. Make him feel comfortable.
My god. You are incredibly hot.,"I'm not here, deal with her. 13 smiles."
Are you an idiot? Do you not think she's hot?,I'm not the alpha here. She is. She's my boss.
I'm not the alpha here. She is. She's my boss.,Increase the drip. If... you think that's the right thing to do.
This is so frustrating.,"Hey. Get in there, see how he's doing."
You were just in there.,"Well, apparently, it's impossible to see anything else while I'm in there. I'm a blinding white hot light of power."
"No. No, it's not.","No, I'm not interested in how he's doing. I'm interested in how she's doing. So get in there and tell me how he's doing."
You think he'll mimic her if I'm in there with her?,"You're a powerful, dominating Man, but who knows?"
So I'm going to get fired before her.,"Yes, you're going to get fired right now unless you get in there... 13 walks out."
"Yes, you're going to get fired right now unless you get in there... 13 walks out.",And how is he?
And how is he?,I know. But how is he? Bitter? Sexually frustrated?
He needs the meds and the tub. Just to keep him stable.,Fine. Soak him again.
He'll be happy. Loves hot tubs.,"No, you love hot tubs. Find the rest of the gang, tell them to meet me at the lecture hall."
Mumbles. Hate hot tubs.,What did you say?
What did you say? I hate...,He likes. Who else was in there?
Who else was in there? No-one.,You didn't think to mention that?
"The guy likes warm, swirling water. I didn't know that was diagnostic.","It's not. What it is, is the water hit him and he had a thought. Not about you, but about him. We need to splash him some more."
Do I know you?,You look familiar.
You look familiar. You too.,"My name's Robert Elliot. I'm from Hamilton, Ohio."
Me too. What do you do?,Stuff.
Stuff. Me too.,What brings you to New Jersey? Is it work or vacation?
Is it work or vacation? Uh... Work.,What type of work?
What type of work? I'm tired.,I eat out a lot. In a lot of restaurants. Opens the box starts pulling out receipts. Knotty Pine. RitParkes.
I know those places.,"They're good, huh?"
"They're good, huh? They're convenient.",For what?
They're on the road.,You on the road a lot?
No more than you I suppose.,Pulls out the vapour rub. You Ever use this stuff? I use it all the time. Smells it.
I use it all the time.,Yeah.
Because... It doesn't smell like dung.,You're saying you like the smell?
Not really. Just doesn't smell like dung.,Something else does smell like dung?
Something else does smell like dung? Yeah. Dung.,You guys ready?
"You guys ready? Now is the time you stare at me, in slack-jawed amazement. He sells farm equipment. They look surprised. See? Pig lagoons, pig farms. Takes off the jacket. And, as Every Parkld knows, where you have pigs, you have pig poo. Roughs up his hair. But as very few Parkldren know, where you have pig poo, you have eperythrozoon infection.","This time tomorrow, he'll be back to his old self. WhoEver that might be."
"Hi, I'm the Dean of Medicine.","Hi, I'm the guy who saved your life."
I can fire him. I can fire him now. I can fire him tomorrow. I don't Even need a reason.,"She doesn't fire me, she nEver will fire me, she needs me."
"He's a good doctor. That's all. I respect his expertise, and I...",She's hot for me. Always...
That still could have been either of us. Looks at House.,You lose.
Damn. House continues celebrating.,You all suck.
"So, which one of us sucks the most?",It's a tie.
It's a tie. Between?,All of you.
We're all fired?,"None of you are fired. The numbers breathe a big sigh of relief. Everyone standing at the back leaves disappointed, except Chase who smiles."
That was nice of you.,Sure.
Why didn't you fire anyone?,They're good doctors.
"Right, why didn't you let Brennan quit?",He's a good doctor.
"Right... By not letting anyone go, you made six people happy and one person happy and rich. Chase won Every one of those bets, so either you're just really nice or what's your cut?",50%... How bad you want to keep your job?
I'll keep my mouth shut,"Hey.. You actually do want to stay, don't you?"
I think I do.,Every one of those idiots got some insight about themselves from the pig salesMan.
"Brian, get the ambulance! scared Casey...","uninterested Ah, sixty-eight's a good run. That'll leave something in the lockbox for the rest of us. Next!"
That's your breakfast?,"Technically, it's Wilson's lunch."
"Twenty-month-old baby, persistent rash, fEver...",cuts her off Too much crying.
Female college student with...,cuts him off Too much drama.
You don't care about the crying or the drama 'cause you won't see the Patient. And you'd treat Methuselah if his snot had an interesting color. It means you've already decided which case you wanna take next.,Tell me about Speed Racer.

I saw something amazing.,Pure truth. She told her mother that she was dying. Stripped her of all hope.
That sounds! horrible.,It's like watParkng some! bizarre astronomical Event that you know you're nEver going to see again.
unconvinced You tell people the cold hard truth all the time. You get off on it.,Because I don't care. She cared. She did it anyway. frowns for a second She did it because she cared.
nods sarcastically The angels of Christmas have finally given House a present he can appreciate.,"Oh, don't ruin it. Don't pin this on Christ, he's got enough nails in him. scowls at Wilson's reindeer hat"
Patient had to die but,cuts him off Why don't you take off that hat?
It's Christmas! It's a reindeer.,"It's a moose, on a Jew."
"It's a moose, on a Jew. Who cares?",sighs Things have their place. You wouldn't hang dreidels from a Christmas tree.
You could. Things don't care.,No. They don't. turns and goes back into the hospital
"Happy Solstice, House.","enters To save us all from Satan's power, when we were gone astray. Have you people no holiday spirit? Bring me the eggnog of good cheer!"
"House, if you have something to say, say it. If you don't, give us a chance to get home before Santa.",stares at him Scrooge. Give the Patient rispiradone.
"That's an anti-psychotic. She's dying, she's not crazy.",I am going to perform a Christmas miracle.
You said all the causes of osteopetrosis were fatal.,"Except for the one we discounted early, because it was impossible."
You're telling me I could have breast cancer? Somewhere not in my breast? That doesn't make sense.,Taub's parents have a winter condo in Florida. They're still New Yorkers.
"Actually, my parents","interrupts Don't care. I told a parable. And now, I'm going to raise the dead!"
"interrupts Don't care. I told a parable. And now, I'm going to raise the dead!",to Thirteen Give me that syringe.
That's gotta be a fat deposit.,"Yes, I could be wrong. If I am, she's dead so shut up."
"If I am, she's dead so shut up. What's that?",Rispiradone also causes galactorrhea. pulls the needle out
What's that? Galactic!?,Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.,"Relax, you've had it before."
"Milk? Eww! wipes her mouth and Parkn, obviously disgusted",We'll cut out your mom's tumor and start her on chemo. All the rest of your symptoms should go away.
I love you. I know.,Have a wonderful life. exits
Why do I Even give you an office? New case. Psych department asked for you personally.,Patient's a crazy person?
You're a crazy person. Patient's a psyParkatrist.,Still fiddling with the TV There's something wrong with coma guy's cable.
He seems fine with it. Your Patient is an adjunct faculty member here but currently... House whacks the side of the TV. The budget committee voted to charge for cable in the Patient rooms.,"Slippery slope. Today we withhold porn, tomorrow it's clean bandages."
"Talk to Carlson in Derm, he runs the budget committee... After you look at this. Hands him the file.","After you talk to Carlson, maybe I'll..."
The Patient is trapped at the South Pole. House takes the file and Cuddy leaves.,"Well that wouldn't be any fun. And for the next two months, winds make it impossible to fly anything in or out."
Or a kidney stone.,That wouldn't be any fun.
"It's possible. She's on birth control. Lots of sex could lead to urinary tract infection, which could lead to an infection-laced struvite kidney stone.",Excessive Antarctic drilling. Bad for the environment and the ladies.
Excessive Antarctic drilling. Bad for the environment and the ladies.,This is where it gets fun. Dumps a box of stuff on the table. These are the supplies and medications she has available.
What else do they have down there?,I just said...
"I don't mean medical stuff, other stuff. Some geological equipment breaks ice and rock the same way we break kidney stones. Everyone stares at him. Discovery channel. I like watParkng them blow stuff up.",Who doesn't? That reminds me. Leaves.
Who doesn't? That reminds me. Leaves.,Coma guy needs cable. Women's billiards is the only thing that's keeping him alive.
I'm sure Carlson will be moved by HIS plight.,Carlson won't listen to me since I hit on his wife.
Smiles. You knew? Starts reading a file.,God no.
"Walks over to a Patients bed and hands the file to a nurse. Amoxicillin, 500 milligrams IV. Moves onto another Patient and picks up the chart.",Following her.
Charging Patients for cable is bringing in 13 grand a month.,"Until this injustice is righted, I am going to waste 13 grand a day."
"Hands the chart to a nurse. Get an EKG and a cardiac enzyme. If those check out, discharge him and tell him to get a snow blower.",Pulls out rubber gloves one at a time from a box and throws them on the ground. How much is 13 grand divided by 4 cents?
Takes the box off him. I am not giving you cable. You're going to have to somehow survive with the broadcast networks alone.,I'll be fine on Tuesdays. Cameron pulls the curtain in front of him.
Some are bigger than others. Some are inside me.,"How's it going, team MacGyver? Sees the screen. Oh, great. I can't get cable, but I can get the South Pole on hi-def."
We're almost ready to start the test.,"Test? Did Ford test the Edsel? Did Coke test New Coke? Did Shakespeare test his final play, Snow Dogs?"
I'm guessing you're Dr House? I was wondering when you might drop by.,Can she see me?
Can she see me? Oh yeah.,"Think Jagger shows up for the sound check? Cate walks away from the camera. Okay. Roadies, off the stage. Go help Cameron in the ER."
Why? No way you're just doing her a favour.,ER is standing room only.
Ready. Cate starts the test which is an egg in a jar of water. They watch as the egg cracks open. Then the jar explodes.,"You, you might want to just, dial it down a smidge."
"I am not doing this. Sits down in front of the camera. Your kidney stone theory hinges on me having sex, but I...",Let me guess. You're as pure as the driven snow.
"Only if the snow likes to be on top. But I am here doing psychological research, generally not a good idea to swap fluids with your subjects.",Struvite stones are possible in people who don't have sex. They're certainly possible in people who claim not to have...
I've had no UTIs. No pain on urination.,You do realise that only one of us is a real doctor?
"That'll tell us if her kidney function's declining. If it is, he's right. Struvite stone's most likely explanation. If not, she's right. Foreman looks at House who just stares at him. Sorry, I know how you like to avoid avoiding confrontation.","While we're waiting for that test to prove me right, start IV cefuroxime. Keep the infection in the stone from wiping out your kidneys."
I'll send the chem 7 results when I'm done. Turns off the camera.,"She's a great psyParkatrist. One session, I've got shrinkage."
Overhearing them. No. They stop and look back.,Your chem 7 results show that your kidney function is declining. Sounds like a kidney stone to me.
The decreased function could be from dehydration caused by vomiting due to a gallstone.,You agreed that the chem 7 would decide if it was a struvite stone.
"While you're waiting, we should run another test with the geology equipment...",You're not taking the cefuroxime.
We have a limited supply of medication and I'm not about to waste it.,"Last I checked, you had a limited supply of doctors."
"Right before I got sick, one of my crew members sEvered his femoral artery. He needs the cefuroxime. Starts breathing heavily.","Right, he called dibs."
His need is definitive. Mine is speculative.,You're breathing fast.
It's because I'm pissed off!,"Lift up your Parkn. Show me your windpipe. She does so, both Foreman and House move closer to the screen for a better look."
It's deviating to the left.,Means her right lung is collapsing.
You need to call someone.,There's no time. Get a syringe and a needle.
Why am I doing!,Shut up and look. Cate does as she's told.
She could pass out. She needs...,She needs to re-inflate that lung.
Means it's not a kidney stone.,"Right side pain, vomiting, and now a lung that gets traumatised without any trauma. Sounds odd, pRobably is odd."
"We should discuss this, then call her back.",No it's fine. I made sure we got the South Pole long distance plan. Your latest kidney function test shows...
"I know what it shows, I ran it.","The more you interrupt, the longer my grandstanding is going to take."
Since when do you let Patients participate in differentials?,"Since the Patient and her doctor happen to be the same person. Your kidney function is still declining, means you have a kidney pRoblem."
But not one that needed antibiotics. Makes us equally wrong.,"No, makes us both wrong. Not equally. You were at least six wronger."
"No, makes us both wrong. Not equally. You were at least six wronger.",They run a PPD before you shipped out?
Excuse us a second. Mutes the microphone. Cancer explains the symptoms. A tumour in her lung or kidney that threw a clot to the other organ.,"And you're worried the tumour might overhear, realise we're on to it."
Obviously you two think I'm in bad shape.,Only if you count the tumour.
Only if you count the tumour. House!,PRobably in your abdomen.
I have cancer? Possibly.,"Since the only imaging equipment you have is X-ray, let's start there. X-ray your entire body."
I'll upload the images when I'm done. Turns off the camera.,Good for you.
Good for you.,She's annoying. Refused to take the antibiotics because other people might need them.
She said she cares about other people? What a poser. KUB is clean. You don't like her because she's a psyParkatrist.,I'm a compliCated Man. I loathe her for Many reasons.
NEver before has a profession been so decried by someone who needed it so badly.,You talk a lot of smack about tranny hookers.
Enlarged mediastinal node.,Lymphoma.
"PRobably, but we can't confirm it without a biopsy.",You can't analyse a biopsy without a stain.
We can't biopsy.,Cause they don't have stains down there. We need a substitute.
She can't biopsy that node without a surgical team and an OR.,"Anything with a strong colour could work as a stain. Printer ink, food colouring, coffee."
"Printer ink, food colouring, coffee. No thanks.","Find a node closer to the surface, one she can biopsy."
That makes sense.,That makes sense?
I said it first.,"In a shockingly calm Manner, after I'd just been jerking you around for 30 seconds without you complaining or analysing said jerking."
I was being mature.,In a lavender shirt. You for some reason are happy.
How dare you? The X-rays don't show any other abnormal nodes.,Abnormal nodes can be felt before they can be seen on an X-ray. You're wearing that shirt for someone.
The health department. They frown on topless oncology. You're going to do a physical?,Have to. You and Foreman are going to be here looking for a stain. House leaves.
I can do the physical. There's no reason you need to watch.,I can think of at least three reasons. One of them's medical.
Where are you? Not in your office.,You're not in the hospital. No reason for me to be.
I am not undressing for you in your apartment.,You're not in my apartment. You're three quarters of a world away. I promise not to get fresh.
I'm not taking off my clothes.,One of us has to.
Thinks about it. Show me your place.,"It's got walls, a floor, and in some places, a roof."
I am not exposing myself without some reciprocity.,"It's my apartment, it's not my soul. Cate just sits there. Picks up the laptop and points it towards the room. Living room."
"Slow down. House moves the laptop slower, Cate notices his bookshelf. Lots of books. I'm betting all medical.",Points it back towards himself. Only if you count Jenna Jameson's autobiography as a gynaecological text.
Fiction is a waste of time unless you can laugh at it.,I love to laugh. Moving on. Moves the laptop again showing a glimpse of the half bottle of bourbon on the coffee table.
Back up. House stops. How bad is the insomnia? Let me quantify that. Do you drink two or three scotches before passing out in front of the TV?,You are so far off. It's bourbon. Gives her a better look at the bottle. Then continues showing the apartment.
No photos anywhere. Family and friends aren't important?,"Well, you're sick. You have 20 people down the hall and you've had exactly one visitor."
I don't want to panic anyone.,You don't like people. You hide on that ice cube so!
"Stop projecting. You're anti-social, so you assume I'm anti-social.",Rolls his eyes. How about if I just get naked and you shut up?
"If I thought I could get you naked, I would've led with that. You'd rather show me your soul than your leg.",Great. You've got me all figured out. You going to try and fix me now?
We're going to be here all night.,How long does it take you to get naked?
It's the South Pole. I wear a lot of layers. Okay. Ready. Picks up the camera.,I saw socks. That's not naked.
"Have I mentioned it's freezing here? When they discover lymph nodes in feet, I will take off my socks.","Use your right hand to palpate the nodes. Any node you can feel is one we can biopsy. Let's start with your breasts, move down to the ass, then..."
I was thinking... go from the neck and work my way down.,"Well, you could. But I'd nEver forgive myself if we found something before we got to your breasts."
"I'm starting with the anterior cervical nodes. Starts to feel her neck, House sits up and puts down the drink.",Turn your head. LoCate the SCM muscle.
I know how to find my lymph nodes.,They teach you that before or after the class on fondling your inner Parkld? House turns on some music.
"No swelling, no tenderness, and I can hear that, House.",Just thought it might help you relax. Anything in the axillary nodes?
All clear. Both sides.,"Slide your hand to your sternum, pRobe for nodes. Moving slowly downward. Cate does as told."
"Down to what, House?","Sorry, can't hear you on account of your heavy breathing."
"I'm supposed to be on oxygen, you tool.",Turns off the music. Hold it. Cate stops. Your fingers didn't go quite as deep. Feel that node again.
Feel that node again. It!it's swollen.,Looks like you're doing a biopsy.
"Okay, take a deep breath... and insert the needle into the node.","Come on, Cate. Let's get this over with."
Mutes the microphone.You used her name.,"Just trying to move things along, Bob. Wilson un-mutes."
You need to pull back on the syringe. Cate tries to pull but nothing happens. You need to pull harder. Cate does so and screams in pain as the syringe fills with some sort of yellow liquid.,You okay?
Are you okay?,It's a valid medical question.
"I have nEver heard you ask a Patient that question. You've nEver asked me that question, and you've seen me fall down a flight of stairs drunk. You've slept with her.","She's 9,000 miles away. Elevator opens, they walk out towards the exit. And while a certain part of me unfurled!"
"No, you! Somehow you've been intimate with her. Why are you following me?",Thought you were following me.
"No, you are definitely following me.",Where are you going?
Out to lunch.,You nEver go out to lunch. Means there's a reason you're going out to lunch. I assume that reason is a huMan being.
Or a sandwich.,Sandwiches can come here.
So can huMan beings.,"Yet she's not, which I find interesting."
I'm leaving now. Walks away.,Small world. Follows.
Are you going to follow me into my car?,It's got two doors.
"Call off your dogs, House. Your little helpers are interrogating my Patients, swiping my charts, intercepting prescriptions.",Why would you think that I'm!
Because I'm not a moron. You had to be pulling the strings here. You think that because they make me miserable I'm going to give you cable?,Let's assume that's true. And it certainly sounds like it might be. What are you going to do?
Nothing. I resigned from the budget committee. Shows House a piece of paper. I only joined the committee to help the hospital. You made me a liability. I now have zero influence over the hospital's cable policy. Walks away and smiles.,Well done.
It didn't work. There's nothing more that we can do.,Put these up. Hands them some fliers.
Reading the flier. Free Rottweiler puppies. Please call after 1100 pm and before 500 am. Looks up at House Is this Cameron's home number?,"Putting up a flier. I love a new puppy. My last one was delicious, very tender."
There's no point in torturing her.,"If she can resign, she can un-resign. Go to def-con one. Forget waiting for a mistake, make her make one."
"If she can resign, she can un-resign. Go to def-con one. Forget waiting for a mistake, make her make one.","Harm suggests perManent damage. Get her to screw up, then fix it. Oh, and this time, don't tell her what you're going to do before you do it. Leaves."
"No, I hope it's something, It's maybe Screams. Oh, no! I'm screwed.",Bad news is you're 0 for 2 in the kidney department.
Is there good news? You're back at home.,Of course. There's cable. And the freedom to work pant-free.
That is good news.,Wilson found signs of inflammation in your biopsy.
"Autoimmune is just your latest theory. Like cancer before that, and a kidney stone before.","Take the prednisone, you'll get better, that'll be your confirmation."
"You practice medicine like it's a fire sale. You've wasted antibiotics, X-rays.",That was not a waste. We ruled out!
"We have a crew member here who has asthma. If he has an episode after I've used up the prednisone, he'll die.","There a good chance he's going to die anyway, since there won't be a doctor there to help him."
We should send her outside.,"Right, just tell her to head north until she runs into a hospital."
Notices something on House's desk. Is that my wallet?,"Yeah, you can have it back. I've already been through it. I like your ice on a sprain metaphor. Makes it seem like we're not killing her."
She'd only need to be outside five minutes.,Without her mittens. Mom told me that was a bad idea. Especially that winter it was 70 below and I had dual kidney failure.
"You didn't touch the cash, but you took the receipts?","Picks up a receipt off his desk. $190 restaurant tab. That's dessert, pRobably booze. Means you lingered. Means it's at least the third date. Means! Starts to leave."
Where are you going?,To talk to the people I pay to come up with medical ideas.
"There are no ideas. The test for autoimmune is ANA. Unless penguins poop immuno-analysers, she's not!","Before A.N.A. testing, people had autoimmune diseases. How did they know?"
How did they know? C3.,Before that.
You don't need them. Holds up a paperclip.,"When you shake the test tube, the paperclip will damage some of your blood cells."
No change. So how long should I give the cells to fatten up before I check them?,Couple hours. Or you could stop being a hypocrite and take the prednisone now.
Not bending to your will makes me a hypocrite?,"If your psych Patients deManded lab results, you'd nEver make a diagnosis."
"So I'm wrong. You sleep like a baby, your life is unfolding as you dreamed.",Everyone is miserable. You don't change that because people don't change.
You want to beliEve that because then you're freed from any responsibility for your misery.,Oh shut up. I get enough of this from Wilson.
"And yet you keep hanging out with him. And from what I hear, you have spent more time with me than with any other Patient.",Sorry about that. Call me when you get the results. Turns off the camera.
How's your Patient?,She has an autoimmune disease. Tell the psych department she's in denial.
"Taub caught the error in time. If she'd just admitted the mistake, maybe I could've just suspended her. But... she's packing up, if you want to say good-bye.",We should be hearing from the South Pole in a few minutes.
We should be hearing from the South Pole in a few minutes. That's it?,Well there's nothing to be done. She screwed up. She's got no one to blame but herself. Cuddy leaves.
I got to go talk to Cameron.,"Cuddy wouldn't can her for one screw-up and if she did, she wouldn't come to me."
Why would she lie?,Timeless question.
LE Prep test was negative. It's not autoimmune.,You're basing that on a test done with a paperclip. Just take the prednisone.
Either find another diagnosis or find another test.,There is one way. You can take this experimental drug called... pred-ni-sone! Your Kidneys start working...
There is another test.,"Scrunches his Parkp packet near the microphone. I, I think Foreman may have just broken up there. What he actually said was there is no other test."
"If I go outside, we'll have our answer? Foreman nods. To House. And you knew about this?","I rejected it because if you're frozen solid, it's hard to get the needles into your arms."
At least five minutes.,Eight minutes outside would kill a healthy person. And healthy people don't suck on oxygen masks. Healthy people can pee.
"I'll go get Sean, have him come with me. Starts taking off layers.",Just take the prednisone!
Are you all right? She collapses.,Oh I'm sure she's just fine. Cate? To Foreman Do you know if there's anyone down there who has a cell phone.
"Took the station mechanic 20 minutes to respond. She'd already slipped into a coma. Started her on prednisone, but no improvement.","Means it's not autoimmune. Good thing she's in a coma, or we'd have to listen to her gloat."
And where are we going?,To find the useful members of my team.
You're letting them off the hook?,"Happy? Because of you, I'm not going to be able to watch law and order in Korean."
Why am I here?,Because I want to ask you about your girlfriend. I must know who she is or you'd have told me her name.
She doesn't have a name. It's some sort of birth defect.,"There's only about 12 people we both know. I can't remember five of their names, so we're down to... Cuddy! Your ex-wives..."
"Your mama. Elevator opens, they walk out. You need to run a kidney function test.","Yes, if only she wasn't in a coma, we could get her to run a test to find out why she's in a coma."
We could talk the mechanic through the test.,Too compliCated... Unless he's thirsty.
And then you can fix it?,Let's say yeah.
Take a straight catheter and insert it...,"These are your only questions? Not, is it safe? Or, is there another way? Or, are you out of your minds?"
You wouldn't ask me if!,Wait a second.
Why do you care how I feel about her?,"Because now, I know that I can get you to do anything to save her. Tell him how to tap the keg. Leaves."
"Because now, I know that I can get you to do anything to save her. Tell him how to tap the keg. Leaves.",You got Cameron fired.
Cuddy wasn't supposed to find out.,No kidding! Get me cable. How tough can that be? Cost a Woman her job. There's only one thing you can say to keep me from firing you.
No kidding! Get me cable. How tough can that be? Cost a Woman her job. There's only one thing you can say to keep me from firing you.,Wrong.
We're still fired?,That should be a hint as to what you're supposed to say.
That should be a hint as to what you're supposed to say. We're sorry.,Wrong.
I love you.,Wrong.
I love you. Wrong.,Right.
Starts to leave. No!,"I didn't mean on this. Seriously, I need cable."
"I didn't mean on this. Seriously, I need cable.","Milk, milk, lemonade?"
This tastes kind of watery.,That's bad news.
How do you figure out which one it is?,"We don't do anything. You're going to drill a hole in her skull. If she regains consciousness, it's increased intracranial pressure."
And if it's the other thing?,"She'll die. But if it's the hypothalamus, she's dead anyway."
"If the pRoblem is the pressure in her brain, and I fix it, is she going to be all better?","Nope, but it'll give us more time to figure out what's wrong."
Starts to panic. I have to get someone else. I can't do this.,"You love her, right? You'd do anything to save her."
"Not this. I can't do this. If, if she dies because of something that I did, then I!","Listen, listen. I am not going to let you hurt her. Okay? Now please... This is her only chance."
Okay. Gets up and walks towards Cate.,"Well, that was easy."
"Bone's harder than wood, lean into it. The skull's only a quarter-inch thick. Once you're midway through, drill in shorter bursts. Sean does as he's told.","If it comes out the other side, you've gone too far."
"The drill gets through the bone and Sean stops it. Okay, now what? Now what?",Let the fluid drain. Blood starts to come out of the hole in Cate's head. After a few seconds Cate starts to wake up.
Sean? What's going on?,"South Pole doc is out of her coma, and now we have a new symptom. Increased intracranial pressure."
Why are we out here?,That's the Patient room. ICP plus kidney pRoblems plus lung collapse equals?
We ruled out cancer.,But not clots. What causes blood clots?
Deep vein thrombosis plus an existing PFO.,PFO would've been discovered in her pre-South Pole physical exam.
"What if the clots aren't clots? Atherosclerosis. Fatty plaque builds up on the arterial walls, pieces break off, block blood flow. Explains Everything.","She has zero risk factors. Forget fat, think clots."
"Forget fat, think clots. No.",You're standing up to me?
You're standing up to me? Maybe.,Just to clarify. You should do that when you're right. Sorry for the confusion. How could a clot!
"Could be a different kind of fat, fat emboli.",That's a perfect fit...
"That's a perfect fit... Except it's completely impossible! Fat emboli requires an unrepaired bone break. Between the x-ray and the exam, I've seen her entire! Epiphany. See, that's what I'm talking about. Kutner bows.",Take off her socks. Sean moves to her feet.
"No, I got it. Takes off her sock rEvealing quite a badly broken big toe.",Your toe is broken.
"Oh, my god.","Bits of bone marrow have been leaking into your blood stream. Those fat emboli have caused blockages in your kidney, lungs, and brain."
It doesn't Even hurt.,Cold numbs Everything. Does a particularly great job on the extremities.
You'll need to close the break to stop the marrow from leaking.,This one you will feel.
To Sean Will you do it?,He drilled a hole in your skull after drinking your pee. I think he's up for this.
"Grab the tip of her toe with your right hand. Hold the break with the other. Sean does as he's told. On the count of three, pull hard. One... two... three. Sean pulls, we hear a loud crack and Cate screams.",Now splint your toe. You'll be fine.
"Thank you, House.",Don't thank me.
To waiter. A bottle of the Bordeaux and some sParkling water.,"Well, you didn't pick her up. Which means she's coming from work too. Which means you're comfortable enough to meet her."
Damn. Thought I lost you when I walked backwards through my own footprints in the snow.,I think I've got it narrowed down to three possibilities.
"Better leave, if you see her, it'll be cheating.",It's not one of your ex-wives.
Because they hate me.,"They don't. They should, but they don't. I called them. Someone new, but someone I know."
Did you Ever consider being happy for me?,Briefly. You ordering the wine before she got here!
"Girls are good, House. And you know it. You solved your case because you cared about that girl.",You're demonstrating the illusion of Manly confidence. Which means you haven't closed the deal yet.
I closed the deal. I just like her.,Still?
"You knew your Patient hated having cold feet because you did a physical exam, because you liked her.","Your theory is I cared, therefore I let her keep her socks on? If that's what love is, then I don't want to have anything to do with it."
It starts with warm feet but leads to other things. Your mom and I will explain when you're older.,"If I'd made her take them off like I should've, I would've seen the toe and would've solved the case days ago."
Sorry I'm late.,Shocked. Cut throat bitch?
I know you chose well for me. I've been blessed.,Cross-species mating. I feel like Darwin in the Galapagos.
Amber and I have a lot in common.,She's a Cutthroat Bitch. You cry over Dark Victory.

"I was wrong, okay? I thought you'd be upset. I thought you'd track me down in the hallways, and...",You shouldn't have discounted the sex. She's obviously limber enough to put off the meltdown for two months.
She's not needy. I don't need needy.,She's scary. Why does Scary need Pathetic?
Are you gonna talk to her?,acts helpless I don't see that I have any choice.
acts helpless I don't see that I have any choice.,You all right with that?

Looks surprised. How... How could you...,"If you all thought it was syph, you wouldn't have woken me up in the middle of the night."
"The bleeding's pRobably from liver damage, pRobably caused by ethanol in the cleansers or the penicillin.",Two more pRobablys than I like to hear.
Liver tests and serologies are going to take a full day.,"Full night, actually."
Could it be any worse on her than loving somebody who can't love them back?,Looks at them. Yes?
You might want to turn off the TV.,I'm multi-tasking. Also doing my taxes. And Cuddy. What'd you find out?
"The Patient has hepatitis. Kutner, Thirteen and Foreman stare at him.",I assume from your omission of the word 'viral' before the hep that it's not another STD.
To Taub. We're all doing this.,There's more?
You have syphilis. House looks surprised.,"Turns off the TV and turns to face them. No, I don't."
One of us found a vial of your blood in the lab...,Which one of you?
"You did, didn't you?",There's something I need to tell you.
You returned him drunk. House turns around startled and sees Amber sitting on a chair behind him.,On time.
On time. Drunk.,On time. No tag backs.
The purpose of the time was to give me time.,So you didn't have sex?
I like sex.,Well you can have it tonight. The L Word is on.
"You don't get to decide what matters. Either you're genuinely afraid I'm going to make him miserable, or you're afraid I'm going to make him happy, or you simply can't stop screwing with anything that moves. It doesn't really matter, because whatEver the reason, you'll only get worse. Until either I stop seeing Wilson, or I stop you. Stands up. What do you think I'm going to choose?","If you terminate the agreement, it's not going to bring peace in the mideast."
I'm not terminating the agreement. I'm amending the agreement. I'm adding penalty clauses.,Fine. WhoEver violates it gets their finger cut off.
WhoEver violates it gets their finger cut off. I'm serious.,"So am I. You want people to drive safer, take out the airbags and attach a machete pointing at their neck. No one will drive over three miles per hour."
I'm not cutting...,We'll figure it out.
Where is she wrong? House hangs he's head. What were you going to tell me?,Nothing.
You're punishing me?,I needed to tell you something... privately.
I'm not going to tell her.,"You'll tell her. She's your girlfriend, you should tell her."
You're my friend.,It's not the same. Opens the door and starts to leave.
Opens the door and starts to leave. Don't sulk.,Where am I wrong? Shuts the door behind himself.
"Your Management style is counterproductive. You gave me authority over the team, just so they could undercut...",Critiquing the clap addled? That's sort of tasteless.
I didn't feel like waiting until your genitals cleared up. You need to formalise my authority over the team.,"No, I don't."
You don't think I'm qualified?,Compared to those three?
You want to punish Cuddy for hiring me without...,I like Cuddy. I like parts of her.
You want to crush the team by crushing me?,I want to empower them.
Mocking me saves lives?,The hospital will pRobably build you a statue one day.
Or you made up that BS because you like humiliating me.,Wouldn't rule that out completely.
Wouldn't rule that out completely. You busy?,"Almost done. To Foreman. Uh, so just remember, the rabbit goes around the tree and jumps down the hole. Ties his shoelaces up."
Negative for sarcoidosis.,"Run him for Everything you can think of. Lepto, sParksto, hemo, and the fourth Marx brother nobody Ever heard of."
She saved his life.,Or she scabbed.
"Starts writing on the board. We, uh, loaded him full of prednisone to try to fix the liver.","Good news is, he's running out of organs to fail."
Roid rage after six hours?,"At that rate, by sundown, he'll have eaten most of us."
"It's not frying his liver, it's frying his syphilis. The penicillin's working, the real Patient is emerging.",So... syphilis prEvents domestic violence. I'm going to be Even more attractive to the ladies.
I was going to test for a heart issue before the syphilis. PFO could explain the heart attack and reduced blood flow to the brain could explain the rage.,"Well, they're all good ideas."
Suspicious. WhatEver I decide? House nods. You're setting me up.,Laughs. Why would I do that?
Why would I do that? Shrugs. PFO.,The PFO's have it.
"You had no choice, you had to treat him. What's done is done. Leaves.","You know that thing I was going to tell you, I've got to tell you. I've got to tell someone. You have to swear not to tell CB."
You have to swear not to tell CB. Shrugs. WhatEver.,"Well, that's not swearing, that's shrugging. It's actually the opposite of swearing."
I won't tell Amber.,My team thinks that I have syphilis.
Surprised. Do you?,Not yet.
Why do they think you do?,"Because I knew that they had access to an old blood sample, and I knew they'd test it sometime for something."
Why would you swap your blood? What are you afraid they'll find?,"Rolls his eyes. Shut up, you're missing the point. Now, they think that I'm on penicillin."
Looks confused. Is this some clEver practical joke that I'm not aware of?,"And as I get better, I get nicer."
"Suddenly getting it, laughs. That's brilliant. House smiles.",Foreman thinks I actually value his opinion.
I'll get my shoes. Turns to walk away but stops. So we don't need to talk about...,No.
So you're going to keep screwing...,"Yeah, and you're going to keep talking about it. We are who we are."
"Patient tested positive for syphilis, right?",Is this some sort of recap?
But why did he test positive for syphilis?,Oh! Uh... I know this.
"Either one, he has syphilis...",I was going to say that.
"Or two, the test was wrong twice, or three, he gave us someone else's blood. House stops.",Who?
Who? Smiling. Amber.,Get that idiotic smile out of my face. I've got to go on a killing spree.
"Or, four, he has something that tests positive for syphilis.",Sighs. It's not chagas.
He worked in Costa Rica before he was married.,"Is two a spree, or do I have to kill you too? Chagas wouldn't explain the niceness."
"I've heard of remote tribes that actually practice acts of kindness, or the chagas caused encephalitis.",The MRI showed no signs...
"Until we started him on steroids, compromised the immune system and let the infection flare up. I did another one. Shows House. It's not much.",Looks at it. It's plenty. You figured this out because I don't have syphilis? Kutner shrugs. Damn. That should have been my epiphany.
Looks at it. It's plenty. You figured this out because I don't have syphilis? Kutner shrugs. Damn. That should have been my epiphany.,"Good news, bad news. Good news is we know what you have, it's treatable, you're going to live. Both Deb and Jeff smile."
What's the bad news?,The cure is a grueling course of pills. It's like one a day for a month.
Now you're just trying to make me laugh.,"Yeah, like that's a challenge."
"You have chagas disease. It's a parasite, it's been asymptomatic for ten years.","Well not quite. Your brain's been swollen, not enough to see but enough to alter your personality."
Now we're back to that.,"He screamed at you, you don't think he can change?"
That was because of the drugs.,So you think drugs are more powerful than parasites?
Smiles. Neither am I.,"Shrugs. Neither am I, but that's because I don't care."
Opening it. Reviews?,"It was brought to my attention that on occasion, I am not respectful of hospital hierarchy. Sticks a lollypop in his mouth."
"The word was contemptuous. Reads over the first review. Well phrased, thoughtful. Flips to next page. Identically phrased. Keeps flicking through. These are all the same.","Because, underneath it all, we are all the same. And Foreman refused to type his up."
"Puts the file down. Well, it's more than I expected.",There's an extra one in there.
"Picks it up again and finds the extra one, starts to read it. Your treatment of Patients is non-existent because you're not a doctor, you're an administrator.",Foreman convinced me that these can be helpful.
"Continues reading. Your Management of employees is, well, let's face it, they're outside carrying signs. Stops reading and puts it down. The strike ended, the nurses have been back for two shifts already.",You'd think I'd have noticed.
Smiles. I got a call from Amber today. Says there's been a violation of your contract. You've been seeing Wilson on her time.,"She breached confidentiality. You can let it slide, Officer. We're Even."
Everything else is great. I just... I don't know. I guess I don't like ketchup anymore. Wonder what else I don't like. Deb looks worried while Jeff continues to eat.,Roll over. Patient rolls over with some help from Amber.
We need a tougher punishment.,Want to come over to the poopy side? Where are you two going Friday night?
Dinner at L'auberge.,Stares at her. You're lying.
"Um. Where are you going? My apartment's on the West Side. to the back of the driver's head Excuse me. You need to go the other way. Hey, did you hear what I said? as he reaches for the car door, the lock drops down What the hell is going on here? What do you want?",driving the car An autographed picture would be nice. Oh! And I'm also gonna save your life.
Just let me go. I won't press charges. Forget the whole thing.,"That's pRobably true, seeing as how you have a brain tumor."
You're that nut-job doctor that keeps calling my publicist.,"Actually, I'm the nut-job head of diagnostic medicine."
"I run Every day. I don't get headaches. I'm fine. So, if you don't mind!","Actually, I do mind. I don't care if you die. But if Brock Sterling dies, Anna nEver finds out he's the father of Marie's baby."

So I just press this button Every time I see a light?,"It tells me where your blind spots are. So! the twins They're gonna turn out to be yours, aren't they."
I told you. I can't talk about that stuff.,"But you want to be done with this, right?"
"sighs One's mine, one's Julio's.",I knew it. pumps his fist Julio knocked her up before her appendix burst. You got her after.
How can you watch that stuff?,'Cause it's awesome.
It's preposterous. Not one real moment since I've been on the show.,"As opposed to shows that represent the world exactly the way it is, like! I can't think of any."
enters What's going on?,Hospital is being inspected and Cuddy dispatched you to keep an eye on me.
What's the test say?,"As I suspected, you have significant losses in the upper right quadrant of your visual field."
Are you serious?,"No, it's a joke."
That readout says his vision's fine.,"No, it doesn't."
You lied to me?,I kidnapped you. You're surprised that I lied to you? Evan jumps out of the chair and grabs his jacket It just means that the symptoms are intermittent.
You kidnapped him?,It's sweet that I haven't lost the ability to surprise you.
It's sweet that I haven't lost the ability to surprise you.,Are you mocking me?
My back. My back is killing me.,Don't care. Busy.
Amber's damn mattress.,"Well that sucks. Don't buy a new one. He takes a syringe from a drawer, locks the cart, grabs his cane and turns to leave. Wilson follows"
Are you being sarcastic? Because we are buying one.,She's incapable of doing anything that matters without turning it into a zero-sum game.
We're buying a mattress for us.,Wow.
What the hell are you doing?,He needs an MRI.
He needs an MRI.,Give me one millimeter slices from the cortex down.
Any particular reason you decided to sedate a Patient for a procedure that's completely painless?,trying on Evan's sunglasses Guy has a history of violent outbursts during surgical procedures.
"Yeah, on TV. It's Evan Greer. He's the main stud on House's soap. Frontal cortex looks clean. No tumors.",Increase the magnification on the occipital lobe. You watch because you like or because I like?
I was unemployed. I,"Bzzt. Sorry. That's not an answer, that's an apology. If we're Ever to come out of the darkness, we have to be proud"
"Occipital, frontal and temporal lobes are clean. So's the optic nerve. Definitely no tumors.",He's fine?
"Uh, what should we tell him?",See if you can talk him out of suing me.
Foot numbness has a huge differential.,It gets a lot narrower when you add in peripheral vision pRoblems.
He already kidnapped and sedated a guy against his will. Makes sense he'd also do something to numb his foot so he couldn't leave.,But it doesn't make sense to include the symptom that he caused in a differential he's so desperate to solve.
Unless he didn't mean to cause it.,"Stick to the filing, sweetheart. Let the doctors do the doctoring. Either toxins or a vitamin deficiency"
"I'm guessing when you drugged him, you didn't catch him and ease him to the floor. He could have pinched a nerve in his ankle when he fell. You need to run an EMG test for motor nerve entrapment or the inspector will own your ass.","Kutner, leave the room. Wait thirty minutes, come back and tell her the test was negative."
Is it okay if I use that time to do the test?,Get out of here.
emptying a plastic bag of papers on the desk The rest of them can help me with all this stuff.,They're busy.
Why don't you have Rico do it?,You can't tell me you didn't notice that pause.
She's nEver waking up.,"Ah, this is a whole new experience in super high def. I had no idea Marie wore an underwire."
What about the way he's holding that stethoscope? His thumb and forefinger are meeting at an odd angle.,Could be demylenation from toxic exposure.
"Yeah, excellent job so far. House, outside.",Keep watParkng. You'll nEver guess what Rico's got in that box.
You have an obsession with an actor or the character he plays. I feel for you. You need to work it out. But I need you to do it when the hospital's accreditation and my job are not on the line.,You want the star of the hottest daytime drama on TV to die in your hospital?
"No, I want you to cure him without committing any more felonies.",I can't do my job if you're going to tie my hands like that.
Fifty-one weeks out of the year I let you run around like a monkey in a banana factory. All I'm asking is that you tone it for a few days.,I want that TV.
We're not bargaining.,You want something. Either you're bargaining or you're begging.
Me keeping my job is good for you.,"Yes, but it's better for you. I just want us to be equally happy."
approaches EMG was negative for nerve entrapment. Means the foot's a real symptom. Could be vitamin deficiency.,Or a toxin.
Or a toxin. Or atherosclerosis.,Or a toxin.
Why is toxin a better idea?,Might not be. We'll know after I'm finished searParkng his set and dressing room for medically relevant stuff. Gotta go. Need a decision.
You're not going to cut your own throat.,"Yeah, that sounds like me. to Kutner Test for heavy metals, organics, biotoxins and search the home."
Really. Just as long as I get to help you break it in.,Pack your Manhood on ice. Maybe the hospital can reattach it.
calling from the store You were so wrong. She's letting me choose.,You choose does not mean you choose.
"Really? Sounded like you choose. I suppose it's possible she meant House is soooo, so wrong.",It's a trap.
Amber doesn't do passive-aggressive.,People who do aggressive don't like to limit themselves. Could a leaky space heater cause vision pRoblems and numbness?
He'd of gotten better at the hospital. It's not a trap.,Did I hear a question mark at the end of that sentence?
"House, look, she's",Gotta go. hangs up
"The gin bottles are all gifts from fans. Brock Sterling drinks it on the show but Evan doesn't drink at all. He's on this whole health kick right now. Fruits, nuts did you take those from his dressing room?","No. You're not going to marry Brock, are you? We've been waiting four years for him to make it official with Anna."
Are you really a doctor.,"Glioblastoma. Need more proof? So, no toxins on the set, how about his regular life? Unusual hobbies? Unsavory friends?"
No. I've been out with him. He's as vanilla as they come.,And by out you mean!?
"Well, I asked him on a date last month. We went out a few times but we weren't right for each other.",Too small or too large?
Is that medically relevant?,"I'm a doctor and it's relevant to me. So, yes."
We nEver got that far. We made out a while then he just said he should go home. He's a real gentleMan.,thinks and looks at the seeds in his hand Now that'd be interesting.
thinks and looks at the seeds in his hand Now that'd be interesting.,He's impotent.
One bad night and a couple of sunflower seeds and he's got autonomic disregulation.,"It's more than just one. He can't Even remember the last time he was able to salute. It's cool, huh?"
B6 wouldn't show up on a tox screen and we didn't find anything at the House.,So all we have to do is filter the B6 out of his blood. Prep him for plasmapheresis.
Just because he didn't salute doesn't mean he can't.,looks around And can you find out where that voice keeps coming from? And tell it to get out of my head.
Plasmapheresis has risks. We should have him spend the night in the sleep lab. See if he gets a reflex erection.,"Confirmation is for wimps and altar boys. We don't need to wait for a reflex. If he can't get engorged the way God intended, he can't get engorged."
I'm not showing him my boobs.,"Lack of response to your chest tells us nothing. Thirteen, show him! exhales loudly Where can I find a decent set of knockers around here?"
Thus the word atypical.,"In that case, it could be an atypical bunion."
"without pausing from charting Could be Graves Disease. Extreme hyperthyroid disease leads to systemic pRoblems including numbness, vision loss and cardiac arrest.",You want to be here.
I have to be here.,Just say the word. I'll fire Thirteen.
Just sign the forms. Thirteen looks up,Smart move. I was bluffing. She's right. We should fry the thyroid before it fries him.
"Uh! I know it's more exciting this way, but shouldn't we confirm you're right before destroying one of the most important glands in his body?","If that gland has drawn a bulls eye on his heart, then no."
Nuking his thyroid puts him at risk for vascular lesions and all kinds of cancer. Protocol says we should do an iodine uptake test.,whispers We? aloud Anyone else want to run a useless test while Brock's thyroid plots its next lethal move? Thirteen raises her hand. Kutner and Taub follow It was rhetorical.
"House is right. House stops writing, mid-signature","Seriously? I mean, I am, but you think so?"
What are you doing here?,Just grabbing a snack.
You keep food in the morgue?,"Well, if I keep it in the lounge, Everyone else eats it."
holding up a food container with someone's name on it That's 'cause it's Everyone else's food.,Oh. I thought it was just Everyone else's bags.
throwing Everything in a covered trash can The accreditation board will light us on fire for this.,"They're not going to find out. Unless, of course, Conway planned on inspecting the morgue in, say! two minutes. feigning ignorance Is that why you're here?"
You're going to get me fired over a sandwich?,No. Over a TV. And you're not gonna get fired because you're gonna fold.
"No, I won't.",But you're gonna push it.
Dr. Jaime Conway. I've heard your name.,"Most people have. It's also a noun. pause I sometimes come down here to relax, unwind. Maybe grab a"
Sweet Sauce. Conway stares,It's a nickname.
An ironic nickname. Wow. It is almost two. Aren't you supposed to be!,"Oh, yeah."
Thanks for the warning.,Any time. leaves
Doesn't the doctors' lounge have that same TV?,"Nope. They've got a 12 inch, exactly like the one that used to be in here."
Files are done.,I'll be doing a dance of joy just as soon as my leg is healed. to the maintenance men Can you tilt that down?
"I know the paperwork annoys you, but Patient records are important. You can't just let them sit there.",I had to.
You miss me. You hired Thirteen to replace me.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. All pretty girls are fungible. You're avoiding."
I miss the job. I miss running around playing private investigator. I miss... the puzzles.,"Seriously. I'll fire Thirteen. Or Kutner, if you think Thirteen is hot."
His kidneys are failing.,I told you to nuke his thyroid.
It's a good thing we didn't. Kidney failure means it wasn't graves.,"So, your test screwed me and our Patient's kidneys. You practically poisoned him with iodine."
Which he could have handled easily if his kidneys were healthy. All we did was rEveal a new symptom. Usually you're all for that.,Must be the rancid tinge of betrayal that's put me off.
You were wrong.,turning on him So tell me to my face. You nEver hesitated before. The Board's turned you into a coward.
I did it because it was the right thing to do.,You did it to pass an inspection.
Does it matter? Kidney failure on top of the other symptoms points to an autoimmune condition which means that any of his other organs could be next. We've already started dialysis. We need to run ANAs for autoimmune.,"You're right. You and the team, go measure the ceilings."
"You and the team, go measure the ceilings. Excuse me?",Accreditation board guidelines state that no object can be less than 18 inches from the ceiling. Make sure we're in compliance.
There's nothing in our office that would be less than!,I don't mean us. I mean the whole hospital.
Have you met me? I can take care of me. I need you to take care of you. I have work to do.,You made it to page 8. Mysterious hospital visit for soap doc.
"Wow. I'll be sure to send my Mom a copy. They told me I have an autoimmune disease, like lupus or sarcoidosis.",That's what we're here to find out.
You really as good as Everyone seems to think you are?,Are you really as miserable as Everyone seems to think you are?
I just want to do something that matters.,"Nothing matters. We're all just cockroaches, wilDebeests dying on the river bank. Nothing we do has any lasting meaning."
And you think I'm miserable.,"If you're unhappy on the plane, jump out of it."
I want to but! I can't.,Mmm. That's the pRoblem with metaphors. They need interpretation. Jumping out of a plane is stupid.
"Well, what if I'm not in a plane? What if I'm just in a place I don't want to be?",That's the other pRoblem with metaphors.
So you're afraid of change?,"No, you're afraid to change."
"When I get out of here, I'm not gonna be afraid anymore. I mean, how Many guys get a second chance?",Too Many. Half the people I save don't deserve a second chance.
And to your other sister.,You realize you're reciting lines from last season?
We're gonna do all the things I promised. Just help me get out of this bed.,Cooling blankets in here.
We've got him on broad-spectrum antibiotics but he's slipped from delirium into a coma.,"Good news is the last time Brock was in a coma, he fathered two Parkldren."
Unless it's a fungus. We could see that under a microscope.,"Test him for fungi, parasites, all creatures great and small."
Where are you going?,To lie down. I need to think.
To lie down. I need to think.,Could be rat bite fEver. But his glands aren't swollen. Which one are you gonna get?
She told me to get the one I want.,"So get it. Listeria explains the sepsis, possibly also the heart pRoblem."
But not the numbness.,If the listeria caused encephalomyelitis which then caused the numbness.
I want a waterbed.,Wow.
I've always wanted one. I know it's ridiculous. It's just! There's something nice about the thought of being rocked to sleep in water. pause No mocking? No Freudian analysis of how the waterbed is really a great big vagina I want to crawl into?,I'm ignoring you because you make me sad. He's on ampicillin. Which means if it's listeria he would have shown some improvement.
No. It's a whole! thing. You need special sheets and insurance and,Who cares? You wanted one your whole life. You're a grown up. You can afford it. Stores sell them.
"Most adults don't go through life the way you do, House, indulging our Every whim.",You don't deserve to be happy.
And yet I am. You?,"It is stupid. he puts down the pillow and starts to leave Live the dream, Wilson."
"It is stupid. he puts down the pillow and starts to leave Live the dream, Wilson.",It's not an infection. It's an allergy. That's why it's not responding to antibiotics.
"This isn't a soap opera, House. People don't just wake up from comas the second you give them drugs.",Especially if we give them the wrong drugs. What'd the tests say?
It was negative for fungus and parasites. But that doesn't mean,"The more infections we rule out, the more likely it is that it's not an infection."
"He has no history of allergies or asthma. Most importantly, none of his symptoms remotely resemble an allergic reaction.",Allergens could trigger an allergic vasculitis. That would explain the symptoms.
One in a million times. Septic infection always explains his symptoms.,But an infection is nEver resistant to Every antibiotic.
An infection is rarely resistant,And allergy nEver responds to antibiotics. NEver beats rarely. QED I won. There were chrysanthemums in his dressing room.
My God. Why didn't you say he'd been exposed to plant life.,"Chrysanthemums contain pyrethrins, a neurotoxin and a know allergen."
"He has an infection. If we give him steroids, we'll kill him.","He has an allergy. If we don't give him steroids, we'll kill him."
Not as fast.,Fast enough. We don't have time for the rest of the tests. We have to do something. And what we're doing right now isn't working.
Fast enough. We don't have time for the rest of the tests. We have to do something. And what we're doing right now isn't working.,A hundred milligrams methylprednisilone.
A hundred milligrams methylprednisilone. Patients' names?,It's one Patient.
You want to give one Patient a hundred milligrams? That'll jump-start a car.,Perfect. The Patient's in a '69 Ford Coma.
"Anything over 50 milligrams, I need a sign-off from Dr. Cuddy. It's protocol. And the inspector's here.","I am 99% certain that she'll consent. he heads behind the counter For the sake of the 1%, why don't I just!"
You're not allowed back here.,"Well, tell the inspector he can put it on my tab."
100 milligrams of methylprednisilone is an overdose.,We were wrong about the infection. He's suffering from a sEvere allergic reaction.
The team hasn't finished the test for allergy. His symptoms don't,"In rare cases! Trust me. At the end of this conversation, I'm right."
Then confirm it. Get a blood test.,What is it about this sEvere and deepening coma that makes you think we got time for protocol?
Protocol has saved your Patient from having his thyroid destroyed and his blood drained.,"If you think I'm wrong, tell me I'm wrong. Don't talk about protocol."
My job's on the line. You're job is on the line.,Okay.
He was still right. It was an allergy.,To what?
To what? Thank you.,I was wrong. to Cuddy You should have stopped me. he leaves
"And as thrilled as I am about The Lady Slipper being the best nightclub Port Lawrence has Ever seen, doesn't compare to the happiness that I feel when Hello?",Don't hang up. What was the verdict?
"What was the verdict? $200,000 fine.",You should have been fired.
"Good night, House.",There are bubbles in his glass.
Can't this wait until,My Patient is allergic to quinine. Cuddy turns on the light and sits up.
And you got this from bubbles?,The symptoms started two months ago. It's also when Brock started downing gin and tonics like a Brit staving off malaria. The gin was fake. The tonic was real.
And tonic water is loaded with quinine. Huh. Nice job.,You should've been fired.
I'm taking back the TV.,I saved his life.
That wasn't the deal.,The contract clearly stated no takesy backsides.
"Good night, House.",What are you wearing.
"Good night, House.","Good night, Cuddy."
Do you like that?,Uh...I don't know.
Do you want me to use my butt again?,House sees a very short flashback of someone bleeding. I don't know how I got here. Exhales into his hand and smells his breath. How Many drinks did I have?
Your scotch hasn't Even arrived yet.,That means I was drunk when I got here.
Still dancing. What do you mean?,That's four words. The accepted diagnostic test for global memory impairment is five random words.
Are you okay?,I'm...Dancer sits on his lap. Trying to find that out. Give me five... Animals.
Um...Cat. Bird. Monkey. Rhino. Goldfish.,"Closes his eyes. Monkey, Rhino... Grabs his head. Either I'm massively drunk Looks at blood on fingertips."

It's all over.,"I have a concussion. Retrograde amnesia. Pats his pockets. I have no keys, no phone. I've been mugged."
No you haven't. You already gave me a twenty.,Did you earn it?
Did you earn it? Not yet.,Someone is going to die.
Looks alarmed and yells toward the bouncer. Kenny!,"Not you. I saw something, a symptom. Someone is going to die unless I find them."
Someone is going to die unless I find them. Who?,I have no idea. Keep the change.
I have no idea. Keep the change.,I saw somebody dying.
You saw thirty people flying into glass and metal.,I saw a symptom before the crash.
"You're concussed. You don't know what you saw and you don't know when you saw it. A week ago, you noticed a symptom in a soap star.",Bad argument. Since I was right about that.
Finishes pulling stuff out of Houses head. That's all of it. A few stitches will hold your brain in place. Starts trying to put in the first stitch.,Pulls away. Ow!
Hey! Hold your head still unless you want me to sew your nose under your eye.,Why was I taking the bus?
Because you were drunk.,What if I saw someone and I followed them on from... Somewhere in Princeton?
Somewhere in Princeton? You okay?,Perfect. Uh...Uh...You. Points to Taub. Get histories from Everyone in here.
Did you just forget his name?,No. To Thirteen Lesbian. Find out if anybody on that bus was taken to other hospitals.
You just forgot mine.,"No, Thirteen. I just wanted to call you a lesbian."
I'm not a lesbian.,"I was rounding up, from 50%. To Kutner Find my cane and motorcycle. Figure out where I went last night."
Pulls out a pen and opens a file. Where's your cane and motorcycle? And where'd you go last night?,You're going to trust me? I lie about Everything. The three of them leave.
You're going to trust me? I lie about Everything. The three of them leave.,How much bigger could it get?
"You don't think it's House motions for Wilson to get the crutch nearby for him. Wilson grabs it and hands it to House. A little weird that there's both a giant crash and a simultaneous, mysterious symptom sighting? House realises something.",What if it's not a coincidence?
You mean like the hand of God reaParkng down and screwing with you?,That... Or the symptom caused the crash. Looks around. Did you see anybody in a bus driver's uniform?
That... Or the symptom caused the crash. Looks around. Did you see anybody in a bus driver's uniform?,"Right here. Purpura on Ralph Klamden's neck, indicative of leukaemia. Caused a bleed in the brain, and hence the accident."
I have leukaemia?,"No, we just ruled that out, pay attention. To Wilson He pRobably had a seizure."
I didn't have a seizure. I got hit by a garbage truck.,Which you drove into while you were seizing.
You saw the bus driver exhibiting the initial stages of a seizure and didn't bother telling him to pull over?,Hey! House walks over to one of the crash victims being wheeled out in a wheelchair by a nurse. Nobody leaves here until I say they can be discharged.
She said I was,Is she me? Feels his forehead. You have a fEver.
"No, I'm fine. 98.6.",I need him to stay.
I just have a stiff neck from the crash.,Stiff neck. Yells to Everyone in the ER. This Man has meningitis. We need to quarantine the whole ER. No one leaves here until their full workup is complete.
You left here at 523 p.m. Your motorcycle nEver made it home.,"Well, that covers ten seconds out of the four hours I can't remember. Where else did you look?"
The other eight were taken over to Princeton General.,Looking through the files. It would be helpful if these came with head shots and resumes.
"Reading off one of the files. Twenty-something year-old Jane Doe. Kidney contusion, laceration on her leg",Both of which are expected complications when someone goes from 60 to 0 in no seconds flat.
The weirdest thing we've got is a ruptured spleen.,"Okay, new plan. We make a list of all the bars between here and the crash site. Find out where I went, we go there"
On it. The three of them start to leave.,"You're not going to do anything, are you?"
We're going to go to the ER and do our jobs.,Someone is dying because I can't remember
"Medical hypnosis can bring the brain to a class II theta state, increasing focus and memory retrieval.","You're not doing to make me do the Parkcken dance, are you?"
In a soft voice. Just relax. Keep letting go of any intrusive thoughts.,"Lying back with his eyes closed. So what, you saw an ad on the back of a comic book?"
Wilson is done talking now. Chase glares at Wilson. Visualize the bus. The way it looked. The way it smelled. The people on it. What they look like.,"This is a waste of... Suddenly House is on the bus, which is empty. Time. Looks around. Cool. Chase appears on the bus in front of him."
Focus on the details.,The bus is empty.
"Shh. Resumes talking to House. Just focus. Clear your mind. Back on the bus, now Wilson is there too. Think back to how you felt. Details you saw.","Looks around. I can't see out the windows, and I can see you guys."
"Why did you get so drunk at five in the afternoon, alone?","I need a reason? Looks to his right and Wilson is sitting next to him. God, I hate 'beer' brand beer."
"When he's hypnotized, can he lie? He...","I can be mistaken, but I can't actually lie under hypnosis. Continues drinking."
What are you running away from?,"When I'm drinking without you? What am I running away from? Hmm, One of those imponderables. Can you hold off on your insecurities until we find this Patient?"
Do you see anyone in the bar?,"Looks around sees some people playing pool, some just drinking, all of them have no faces."
He's concerned about you. Why does that mean he's insecure?,To Wilson Will you get your girlfriend out of here?
Amber's there? You've got Amber in your head?,You put her in my head. I can't Even have a conversation with you in my subconscious without her tagging along.
Well she better have her clothes on.,Sighs Unfortunately. Pause I didn't mean to say that out loud.
Say what out loud?,I didn't say it out loud? Nothing.
What's going on in there?,"To Chase If I can't lie, I need these two out of here."
"Let's just ignore Wilson and Amber for now, shall we?",I wish it were that Notices that Wilson and Amber have disappeared.
Good. Now you're accessing your temporal lobe. Does the Bartender have any odd symptoms?,He seems fine. Looks around Anybody here sick? Anyone here taking the bus?
Anyone here taking the bus? You are.,Looks at the Bartender again. Because... You took my keys.
Good. This is good. Now we can retrace your steps. Let's go back to the bus. What's in front of you?,Back on the bus. He can see all the passengers. Passengers.
"Anything, special about them?",Some emo guitar hero wannabe.
"You're focusing on him, why?",Emo Guy picks his nose. Because nose picking could mean nasal pruritus. He's dying.
Emo Guy picks his nose. Because nose picking could mean nasal pruritus. He's dying.,To Emo Guy. You a nose picker?
Do I have to answer?,"If the answer was no, you would have answered. Tilt your head back."
"He's fine. He doesn't Even have meningitis, just like Everybody else we've had to give meningitis shots to. To Emo Guy. You can go.",You have a brain tumour.
"You're kidding, right?","If I was kidding, I'd be dressed like you."
You're fine. A nurse will sign you out.,Go home. Have fun. Relax. I'm pRobably just a nut case. Emo Guy looks at Cuddy.
Sighs. Tilt your head back.,"Looks in Emo Guy's nose, sees nothing of interest. You can get your things and go."
Yelling. Oh! Oh! I can't get up. I can't move my legs.,Your legs are not your biggest pRoblem. Your biggest pRoblem is... I don't know what your biggest pRoblem is.
Your legs are not your biggest pRoblem. Your biggest pRoblem is... I don't know what your biggest pRoblem is.,"So, we have the who, but not the what."
We've only got one symptom to go on. Sudden onset paralysis.,We actually have two symptoms.
"CT ruled out subdural hematoma, stroke, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Guillain-Barr fits.","Makes some weird arm movements, Everyone looks at him. I'm just trying to figure out what Guillain-Barr looks like."
You can't just eliminate Everything because it doesn't match what you might have seen.,How about because it doesn't match what I could have seen? Guillain-Barr has no external physical Manifestations.
Where are you going?,"To smell a bus, obviously. Taub, Thirteen and Kutner follow him out. Foreman stays behind."
Why are you smelling the passengers' clothes?,Smell is the most powerful evokerater of memory. Takes a couple of Vicodin. I need to get back on that bus.
Okay. So why are you taking so much Vicodin?,"If Cuddy asks, blocking the pain helps focus the memory."
"You split your head open, you should rest. Hands him another piece of clothing. Anything?",A hint of... Exploded bus. Takes another couple of Vicodin.
"House, that's four Vicodin in forty seconds. At this rate...",Dumping all the clothes onto the table. Wish me luck. I'm going in. Rambo style. Slams his head down in the clothes.
"House, do you think this is going to work, or are you just stoned?","Stands up again and now he's back on the bus. Both, apparently."
You're wrong. It's not working.,"So, you're saying I'm not here. Walking towards the bus driver."
"If this were a real memory, you'd be limping. House looks down and notices that he isn't limping. And you wouldn't be talking to me. I'm obviously a hallucination.",Okay. So I went a little heavy on the Vicodin.
Okay. So I went a little heavy on the Vicodin.,We're both in my head. You'd think one of us would have noticed the blood.
Why haven't you had a head CT yet?,Who do you want me to treat? Me or you? Did you have a seizure?
Dumb question. The brain's too fried during a seizure to form memories.,"Dumb answer. I wasn't asking you, I was asking me. Because you've already proven that you're not here."
I'm getting a headache.,Is that a clue?
"He can't. House turns around and sees that same dark haired Woman from earlier on, now there are other passengers around. The hallucination is your messed up brain's way of reasoning out a pRoblem.",You weren't on the bus.
How do you know?,Five hundred dollar shoes. Not on a Princeton cross-town.
Must be another reason why I'm here.,Yes.
Monitoring the test. Stop fidgeting.,"If you haven't found the bleed yet, it can't be"
"There's edema, and localized swelling in the section of the temporal lobe that controls short-term memory. Also, the penis size cortex is set to pathetic. What didn't you say out loud?",Very little.
"When you were under hypnosis, you were talking to Amber?",I wanted to see her naked.
"Seriously, what were you hiding?",I want to see her naked.
You want to see Everyone naked. Why would you hide that?,"Laughs. Well some guys get upset when you objectify their girlfriends. But if you're okay, I've got a digital video camera. So we could"
"Why would I be upset that you're treating my girlfriend like you treat Every other Woman on the planet, unless...You're not? Unless it's deeper than that. You WEREN'T objectifying her.","Trust me. I want to do some very nasty, demeaning stuff to your girlfriend."
It's a longitudinal fracture of the temporal bone.,I banged my head.
This isn't just a boo-boo.,I'll rest once I've figured out what's wrong with this guy.
"Why? Why this guy? You want Patients with weird undiagnosed symptoms? You get five files like that on your desk Every morning and you'd nEver risk your life for them. House turns around. Why is this guy so special, so that you become BatMan?",I don't know.
It's two in the morning. You should be home resting what's left of your bruised brain.,Recovery's too fast.
It's my stomach. Oh... Lies down on his back.,Which means it's not transverse myelitis.
Rapid onset. It could be a perforated ulcer.,"Wouldn't explain the paralysis. Addison's, from a tumour. It's possible that I saw his eyelids droop."
We've scanned his head five times. Looks at House and notices blood dripping from his ear. You're bleeding.,A little thing called a bus crash. It's just a scalp laceration. It could be hidden in his optic Parkasm.
It's coming from your ear. You think that's a good thing?,Ignores Foreman. But that would have affected his eyesight. I need to take a bath.
"Hallucinations and smells were kind of working, right? Why the bath?",Hypnosis gave me a nose picker.
I don't think I was Even born when that movie was out.,Well then you're too young to be a doctor. That movie was released in 1980.
That was twenty-eight years ago.,"No, it wasn't, shut up."
Did you just forget what year it is?,No.
"And act like a nerve gas, stop your heart, you'll go to heaven and be omniscient. Good idea. Not going to happen. Starts closing the lid. House stops her.",Don't do anything. Even if I escape. Eat a goat. Get shot by police
I didn't know you rode the bus.,"I used to drive home after getting drunk, but some mothers got MAD-D. What are you doing here? You weren't on the bus with me."
Gets up and walks over to House. Then I guess this isn't a memory. It's a fantasy.,"If it's a fantasy, you'd be wearing... This. Cuddy clothes suddenly change to a much skimpier outfit."
"You're convinced your Patient is dying, and you want to waste your time with a sex fantasy?",Don't blame me. Blame my gender.
"Well, I'm not here to indulge that. I'm here to help you figure out what symptom you saw. Your Patient was driving the bus, so all you could see",Why can't you do both?
"Your Patient was driving the bus, so all you could see was him sitting down. Most likely facing forward.",House smiles as he watches Cuddy.
Could indiCate aortic insufficiency.,Marfan's syndrome.
Or syphilis. Takes off her skirt. She is now just wearing her white bra and underwear - which are glowing under the black light - and her black stiletto's as she swings around the pole to face House again.,What if his earlobes were just drooping?
What if his earlobes were just drooping? Ehlers-Danlos?,Or cutis laxa.
It's not fatal in adults. She turns around. With her back to House she unclips her bra.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's an adult, very good point. Keep going. She holds her bra up and turns around to House again who is leaning forward watParkng very closely."
"I'm distracting you. She stops dancing, and sits down beside House. She's wearing a suit again.","Screams. No! Dance, Woman!"
You'd rather be diagnosing.,I screamed no.
"Hey, over here. House looks up at the bus driver and Cuddy disappears. Remember me? I'm the sick guy. House gets up and walks over, without limping.",Tell me what I saw.
Was it the blood dripping from my ear? Shows House his ear which is dripping blood.,That doesn't make sense. Because your shirt wasn't stained. And because that was me. House's ear starts bleeding.
"I could have had a subtle hemiballismus, indicating the early stages of Huntington's.",Huntington's wouldn't explain the abdominal pain. And it's only on the table because we're thinking of Thirteen.
A shuffling gait could suggest Parkinson's.,Except there's no such thing as shuffling sitting.
Appears behind him. He moved when he helped the old lady up the steps.,Turns around and walks over to her. Who are you?
I'm the answer. Look.,At what?
"Here. House turns around, the bus is full of people and the Bus Driver is helping an old lady up the steps.",To Mystery Woman.
Help him up.,Jumps up. I got it! It's Parkinson's.
House. Your ear.,Start him on levodopa.
You should sit down. House!,Get that out of my face.
Welcome back. I'm Nurse Dickerson.,I don't need your name. And I got your profession from your super competent technique of melting my retinas.
Verbal faculties seem to be intact. Do you remember passing out?,I remember puking on Cuddy's shoes. Turns his head. Ow.
Yeah. Skull fractures tend to hurt.,It'd hurt a lot less if you didn't swipe my pain pills.
Dr. Cuddy's orders. Wants me to regulate the amount,"Sees a security guard standing near the door. Wait a second, you brought muscle?"
Dr. Cuddy's orders.,Means I was wrong.
Thank you. But Wilson's wouldn't explain Phone rings and he answers it. Foreman.,Lying on his couch using his mobile. How did you eliminate Parkinson's?
"Well, the tests confirmed the abdominal pain was caused by liver failure.",I assume you've already ruled out hepatitis and Wilson's.
Give him five minutes. Brainstorming a few possibilities isn't going to explode his brain.,"Then if she's wrong, that makes this phone call that much more exciting. What about hepatic fibrosis?"
It could be thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.,Did I mention this diagnosis needs to make sense?
"Why doesn't it make sense? The bus driver's Asian, his potassium is slightly low","If he got paralysed while driving the bus, don't you think I would have gotten off at the next stop?"
Not if the next stop was at a 90 degree angle into an SUV.,"The bus would have slowed, I would have noticed"
TPP has all the confirmed symptoms. There's no downside to testing.,Genetic test is too slow. Nurse takes phone away from him so he yells out. Run the bagel test!
Answers it. Yeah?,In his bathroom using a different phone.
I told you not to lock the door.,Yells out. Still wiping! To Kutner. Put the phone up to bus driver's grill. Kutner does as he's told and House listens to the bus driver's breathing.
Who are you talking to?,My large colon. To Kutner. TPP is not consistent with your Patient's laboured breathing.
Did you take my cell phone?,My large colon did. I'm negotiating its release.
I'm negotiating its release. Help!,What's happening?
The test worked. He collapsed.,"You're half right. He's wheezing, isn't he?"
"He's wheezing, isn't he? Yeah.",You can't wheeze without moving your chest muscles. This isn't TPP.
Then what is it?,Well how am I supposed to know? I'm not there! Hangs up the phone.
It must be a pulmonary embolism. Cuddy walks in with House.,So why haven't you pushed a vial of tPA?
I asked him back in.,At the tail end of me Patiently explaining how you idiots were idiots.
We pushed tPA ten minutes ago.,That means it's not a clot.
Get him to the OR to suck it out.,Must have just screwed up the intubation. Checks the tube. Seal's good.
"It's a clot, House. They start moving him out.","Wait, wait. They stop. Look at his teeth. He's got shiny new caps. He's had recent dental surgery."
House! House!,House! Turns around and sees Thirteen standing there. Oh. To Thirteen Get a syringe.
Yelling through the glass. I didn't bring you back here so you could stage a coup! Kutner tries to open the door but it doesn't budge. Thirteen goes to remove the crutch.,Listen to me.
"Knocks on the glass. Dr. Hadley, open the door. Transcribers note We have a name! From here on out I will be referring to Thirteen as Hadley.",I'm not plumping his pillows here.
I can't risk you stabbing him in the heart looking for an unconfirmed air bubble.,Stab him.
Bangs on the glass again. Dr. Hadley!,See? She doesn't Even know your name. Yells. Stab his heart! MaParknes start beeping.
Looks at the screen. Sat's at 75.,"Yes, he's suffocating."
If you're wrong,"Shut up and make a decision. You keep standing there, he's dead either way."
Open that door. Hadley stabs his heart just as they finally Manage to get the door open.,Holds up his hands. Don't shoot!
The O2 sats. MaParknes stop beeping. There was an air bubble. He's okay.,The other nurse always used to tuck me in.
I'll be on the couch. With a shotgun in my lap.,Worrying about me?
Making sure you don't try and make a limp for the border. Get some sleep. Turns out the light.,"I'm not sleepy, Mummy."
Takes the blanket off and sits up. Me neither.,Who are you? And why are you stalking me?
"Technically, you're stalking me. She plays with her necklace.",Looks at her necklace which is a yellow orangey colour with something in it. What is that? Mosquito?
Maybe just a fly.,In the ointment. So there's something wrong. There's some detail I'm not noticing that's spoiling the big picture.
In the ointment. So there's something wrong. There's some detail I'm not noticing that's spoiling the big picture.,Is this significant? Or is this dream just going in a different direction now?
I guess that depends. Still brushing House's hand against her cheek. What are you going to do with that?,House looks his hand which has a red ribbon in it. I have to tie this around you. Ties it around her leg.
Ties it around her leg. I'm cold.,Stay with me. Why did I say that? Blood starts to ooze onto the ribbon.
Stay with me. Why did I say that? Blood starts to ooze onto the ribbon.,Hey.
Hey. Go away.,It's not over. She turns around and looks at him. I saved the wrong person. She sits up.
It's not over. She turns around and looks at him. I saved the wrong person. She sits up.,"This wasn't just a dream or a fantasy, or a drug-induced trip to Wonderland."
So the bus driver with the air bubble was just a coincidence?,Nope.
You're not leaving. House walks over to the closet and pulls out a blood pressure arm band and puts it around his arm and starts pumping.,What's the most dangerous thing a Patient could do when his brain is on the brink of herniating?
"Elevated heart rate, BP... Which is exactly why you need to stop. House grabs her hand and sticks it on his neck so she can check his heart rate.","Instead of sleeping, I'm going to be pacing around this apartment trying to decipher those visions."
Why does this matter so much?,I don't know. Heart rate?
Heart rate? 127,BP? She walks away and grabs a stethoscope. Contextual memory. I need to get back on that bus with all 31 passengers to remember who and what I saw.
I'm not going to call in crash victims because you've gone insane.,Maybe I don't need the actual victims.
Maybe I don't need the actual victims.,Who's playing Anne McKeehan?
You think that staring at pictures on our shirts is going to be more effective than hypnosis?,"Well, if only you'd stop talking, the re-enactment could stimulate activity in my hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex."
Stands up. Are you okay? House stares into space. What'd you see?,It just slipped away. Takes some pills.
Is that Vicodin?,Nope. Just a little memory pick-me-up.
Are you crazy? Alzheimer's drugs will make your brain go into overdrive.,That's the point. It'll speed up my neuronal firing. Turn up the voltage on my memory.
And blow out your heart. How Many did you take?,Just now? Or including the ones I took on the ride over?
"House, this isn't worth House.",Looks to his right and sees the mystery Woman sitting facing him. She is wearing a red scarf now. Why are you here?
You beliEve in reason above all else. There must be a reason.,You have something to tell me.
Yes. Who am I?,"That's asking, not telling. Who are you?"
You know who I am.,"If I did, I'd be passed out in bed instead of OD'ing on physostigmine on the 6th Street cross-town."
What's my necklace made of?,Looks down at the necklace. Resin.
Who am I?,I don't know. Why the guessing game?
Because you don't know the answer.,"And if I don't, you don't. But you know the clues."
I know what's bugging your subconscious. What's my necklace made of?,"Looks at the necklace again, realises and whispers. No."
Who am I?,Shakes his head. Doesn't make sense.
What's my necklace made of?,Amber.
What's my necklace made of? Amber.,I have to tie this around you. Removes the red scarf from around her neck and uses it as a tourniquet around her right leg.
Removes the red scarf from around her neck and uses it as a tourniquet around her right leg. I'm cold.,Stay with me. Just stay with me.
You idiot! Your heart stopped.,Amber.
Amber. What?,"Amber. It was Amber. Tries to sit up, Cuddy helps his head onto her lap. She was on the bus."
"You almost kill yourself, and all we're getting is drug-induced fantasies.",Have you spoken to her?
She's pRobably working. She's... She's been on call. Looks at his watch. I called her... Starts to realise. She didn't call... I... I... How could she...,I don't know... Jane Doe 2.
"Realises what he wants, grabs the file and starts reading from it. Female. Late twenties. Kidney damage. Does Amber have a birthmark on her right shoulder blade? Looks at Wilson. Wilson turns and looks at House.",She was on the bus with me. She's the one who's dying.
vo Previously on House.,vo I don't know how I got here. I saw a symptom before the crash.
vo I don't know how I got here. I saw a symptom before the crash.,Why was I taking the bus?
Taxing an already injured brain.,Someone is dying because I can't remember.
Someone is dying because I can't remember.,vo It was Amber.
vo It was Amber.,She was on the bus with me. She's the one who's dying.
Her heart won't stop racing. No idea what's causing it.,Sure it wasn't the bus that landed on her?
"barely audible Oh, my God.",Delayed reaction to the trauma. She lost both her kidneys in the bus crash. She ripped up her femoral artery.
"We fixed the artery, got her on dialysis for the kidneys. WhatEver's doing this to her heart, it isn't from the crash.",Check her potassium?
She's been under the whole time. She had no ID.,Pushed adenosine?
"And verapamil, and floated the swan an hour ago.",Coronary angiography?
Three critical Patients ahead of her. We'll have her in within the hour.,We're fifteen minutes away from Princeton Plainsboro by ambulance.
You wanna move her? Her heart rate is a hundred and thirty.,She's hemodynamically stable. We're moving her.
You're not her doctor. You can't make that decision.,looking towards Wilson Her husband can.
looking towards Wilson Her husband can.,loudly for Wilson to play along Right?
loudly for Wilson to play along Right? Move her.,If the trauma didn't damage her heart...
still grief-stricken Why was she on the bus?,"I don't know. If she had any underlying condition, the accident could have exacerbated it."
Why were you with her?,shouts I don't know! I'm not hiding anything. I just don't remember. What else could damage her heart?
shouts I don't know! I'm not hiding anything. I just don't remember. What else could damage her heart?,"Wilson, don't get lost! I'm barely coherent. I need your help right now."
"Wilson, don't get lost! I'm barely coherent. I need your help right now.",V-fib!
I need your help right now. V-fib!,Charging.
Charging. Okay. Okay.,Clear.
"Wait, wait, wait! Protective hypothermia.",You wanna freeze her? Her heart's not beating.
"Her heart's already damaged. If you restart it, it'll keep racing, shoot off free radicals, and kill her brain. We ice her down, put her on bypass until you've diagnosed her.",This is not a solution. All you're doing is pressing pause.
"House, this is Amber! begging Please.",Cold saline solution.
Why are we doing this?,Bought us time to think.
Bought us time to think.,The trauma must have stimulated a pre-existing heart condition.
"Autoimmune congenital anomaly, blood clotting disorder, lead poisoning...","gives her a healthy dose of frustrated sarcasm Great! Let's explore that. Quick, get her on panacea."
"EKG, nope. Heart's in the off position. Thallium uptake scan? Useless on a cold heart.","berating Yeah, we get it."
Why not cyanide? He's a mess. He needs to sleep.,to Kutner I had a heart attack this morning.
I need to know if there's anything medically relevant that you couldn't share publicly.,looks around in mock-concern Is this a Philanderers Anonymous intervention?
You were obviously drinking last night. Maybe you took Amber to a bar.,I left here on my motorcycle alone.
You ended up drunk on a bus together. Maybe you met Amber in the bar.,gets a file out of the drawer I was not having an affair with her.
You can't really say that if you don't remember.,"I lost four hours, not four months."
vo Are you okay?,Can't really say yes when it's a hallucination asking.
"Don't worry, you're just dreaming.",What symptom did I see in you? A myoclonic jerk...
A myoclonic jerk... Boring.,An incredibly rare neurological symptom is boring? Am I in someone else's subconscious?

Now I know how to get it. simply No.,frowns You don't Even know what I'm talking about.
You need to rest. I have yet to hear about any study linking electricity and rest.,Deep brain stimulation. It's been proven. Electrical impulses applied directly to the hypothalamus could evoke detailed memories.

The team has found something. Can you ask her if we can be excused?,What?
Sh-she'd have to be an addict to take enough for it to damage her heart. I'd know.,Did you know that she was hiding them in her vitamins?
"No, we've been over this. Starting her heart could cause brain damage, could burn out the heart muscle.","thinks Test her heart without starting it. Crack her chest open, reach a finger inside the pulmonary vein, run it across the valve."
That's the safer course?,It is if we're wrong.

"And the cardio fits just as well. But there's no way we can tell, since we can't take her temperature.","I had a dream. She was pouring me a glass. And since I'm a scotch-, beer-, gin-, and rum-Man..."
"I know you love her and, uh, you're scared she's gonna die. But just making her colder and colder isn't a cure. It's not dealing with the reality.",Sherry means something.
decides to humour him Amber doesn't Even drink sherry. House. Can we get back...?,"If she did drink sherry, it would mean nothing. Since she doesn't, my subconscious is obviously trying to make some other point."
"A coaster with Sharrie's Bar Estd. 1954. A glass of scotch is placed on it, by the Bartender.",getting up Wilson's right. We need to make her colder.
Putting more ice on her is just delaying the diagnosis.,"getting his coat Not on, in. Fill in her lungs with slurry."
Where are you going?,Taking Wilson out for a drink.
Is this the place?,looks around Maybe.
... for these.,Did you see me here with a-a tall blonde Woman?
"Yeah, I think she joined you after scotch number sEven.",Did she seem sick?

You're the type that doesn't care if you're right or wrong because they've hired me to investigate the wrong person.,That's an actual type?
You want me to check out Wilson. You want to find out if he's,How do you know about Wilson?
What do I do for a living?,You checking me out? Have I been paying for that?
"So far, you haven't paid for anything. You want to find out he's pining. You want to find out if there's something about him that will tell you he's gonna come back or something you can use to make him come back.","House thinks, then looks away as he asks Is there?"
"No, no, there's nothing. Sorry. long pause That will be $900.",I gotta go. I'll get you a check.
Colonoscopy was clean.,Then that just leaves cancer.
The fact that the kid's colonoscopy was negative doesn't prove anything.,"Yes, the fact that it didn't prove anything didn't prove anything. Excellent point."
The opening would have to be open shortly before death.,"Unfortunately, we can't know when shortly before death is until shortly after death. And that seems like an obstacle."
What if there was a way around that?,Then we're kind of all sweating over nothing.
It's not gonna,Do it.
What if it is autoimmune?,What if we don't have conversations we've already had?
We don't have time to dismiss things we've already dismissed. Nothing fits.,"See, that's an example of a conversation we've already had. She's sick. Something fits."
Something fits. MS?,"exasperated No! Okay, from now on, no one says anything unless no one's said it before."
Where are you going?,You guys start immuno-gels on her CSF to look for hidden protein markers.
Treatment for what?,Cancer.
It's not cancer. Chemo's toxic.,It's something. Which means we should treat her for something.
It's something. Which means we should treat her for something.,She's fine. Where's her chart?
You rang emergency to get her chart?,I know.
You found cancer?,No.
Then you have tests indicating,Nope.
Then why should I sign it?,That's a good question.
So you do have proof that it's cancer but you can't tell me because it might affect the way I react to the medicine?,"If that were true, and it would certainly make sense, do you think I could tell you that it's true? enormous wink. She signs."
I was practically blind before the transplant 20/200 vision.,Didn't you cover all this personal stuff with Dr. Foreman?
You don't care who I used to be?,You're a post-corneal transplant math teacher. I deduced that you were a blind math teacher.
I was an arParktect.,interested You gave up arParktecture after you could see?
The world was ugly. You think the world would be any different if your leg was fine?,No.
"Think you'd be any different if your leg was fine? I mean, the doctors told me that my life was gonna be so much better once I could see. I would date, I would dance, but, uh, the guys I hated dancing with before I hate dancing with after. My parents were still dead. I was still alone.",You're fun.
You don't seem all that different.,I haven't given up. He leaves.
"Wilson's got a new job, hasn't started yet, but",So who are we following?
See that lady up there?,You point at the target?
"No, I'm following the one halfway in between that point and that point.",House focuses on the target with his cane. Pretty. Who hired you?
No one. I just like her.,You're stalking her?
"No, no, I followed her out of that bookstore back there.","You are stalking her, just not for very long. So what else can you tell me that I might care about?"
He attends this grief counseling thing twice a week where they go around the room and cry about who's dead. Cameron's been to his House sEveral times. They just talk about death and losing loved ones.,"What!? He turns to join Lucas. If she turns her head, she's gonna see that we're walking the wrong direction."
"No, no, no, she won't. I'm very nondescript.","Well, I'm not."
"Well, then you stay four feet behind me.",How do you know what they're talking about?
I'm in the same grief counseling group. I recently lost my mother.,You'd get laid more often if you told them you lost a kid.
I didn't lose a kid.,You're a PI who can't lie?
Are you lying?,simultaneously No.
simultaneously No. simulataneously Yes.,Lesson one Commit.
over her shoulder as she continues walking More uncomfortable.,She's not your type. Your type is much stupider than her. What did Wilson say about me?
"Oh, you've nEver come up.",In the grief counseling or in the other
And wishing nEver works. She's better.,I could tell at once.
Can't beliEve it. It's cancer.,It's not cancer.
It's not cancer.,Labs show that our Patient is healthier. She's gonna get sicker. Then she's gonna die. I brought Thai food.
What did you see in her?,Nothing. It's not cancer. All the tests say it's not cancer. They've always said it's not cancer.
Treatment proves it's cancer.,"Eh, treatment proves it could be cancer. It's not cancer."
This was your diagnosis.,I nEver thought it was cancer.
You treated for cancer.,"I thought that what she had acted like cancer. If it acts like cancer, maybe it'll respond like cancer."
It did. 'Cause it's cancer.,"We have to find something that walks like cancer, talks like cancer, tastes like cancer, pops some food in his mouth but isn't cancer."
"No, we don't. Better is better. Who cares why?",I do. And so does Tetrault.
And so does Tetrault. Who?,The dead tuba player.
The dead tuba player. Tibalt.,"The point is, he died last, but he died. Which means she's gonna die too."
Tibalt wasn't receiving cancer medication.,There's a cancer drug that's used off-label for arthritis.
There's no record of arthritis.,Did you interview all the tuba students?
"If he had joint pain in his hands, he couldn't have played.",Then it wasn't in his hands.
Then why do we care about his students?,One of them is Canadian.
This makes no sense.,"I know. She's dead unless we can find what's cancer... but not cancer. They all think, silently. Something's missing."
"I know. She's dead unless we can find what's cancer... but not cancer. They all think, silently. Something's missing.","I need an epiphany. Wilson stares at him, tight-lipped. What are you billing out at, $300 an hour? Here's four."
There are other oncologists.,Better oncologists.
That's not the way it works.,"You have a way of thinking about things. It's sloppy, it's undisciplined, it's not very linear. It complements mine. It drives me down avenues that I wouldn't otherwise"
"House, please go away.","Cancer, but not cancer. Responds to cancer treatment, but there's no Wilson tries to close the door but House blocks it. How are you?"
Don't do this. Please. Please. Don't do this. I'm trying to move on.,"By hanging out with Cameron, talking to Cuddy, Foreman, but not me. I! short, mirthless laugh I paid a private investigator to spy on you."
sighs You didn't.,"You want to move on from me, you got to deal with me, talk to me."
You had no right,We're not friends anymore.
"I have the right to walk away from you, House. There's a world beyond you. You need to realize that, and Even if you don't, I'm moving on. The next time you knock, I'm not answering.",Nothing yet. Keep talking.
Keep talking. I'm sorry.,You charge me for listening in on my own conversations?
"Yeah, why wouldn't I?",How Many friends do you have?
How Many friends do you have? 17,Seriously? You have a list?
"No, I knew this conversation was really about you, so I just gave you an answer so you could get back to your train of thought.",Well done. I have one. Had one.
"You know, friends are important. You're gonna miss",Shut up. Friends allow you to not sit in a room by yourself. Are you charging me for this?
Are we friends?,No.
No. Then yes.,Do you wanna be my friend?
No. You scare me a little.,"He thinks if he's not a friend, he can't talk to me. We can talk, we can be two huMan beings talking"
I'm with him. Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.,"Yes, you did. I was in the middle of a sentence."
"Yes, I did. You're repeating yourself.",I'm grateful. Make your point.
"It's like that cancer, but not cancer thing you were talking about before. Friends are friends, customers are customers, and Everything else is Everything else. If it's not, nothing's nothing.",And anything can be anything. looks at his watch 1010. Stop the clock. He starts walking away.
He starts walking away. What?,The world is not as ugly as she thinks it is.
The world is not as ugly as she thinks it is.,"Cancer, but not cancer."
Why are you in my office?,"To find the anomaly, I need to chop off the top of her head. Pretty sure I need your approval for that."
I'm gonna trust your first instinct.,I'm not usually confused when you say things like that.
"I'm ordering her cancer treatment to be continued. Holds up a bill. Why does it cost $2,300 to fix a coffee maParkne?",Cancer stem cells are real.
You've no proof.,I have the brain scan.
The normal brain scan.,This is why I need to take off her head.
To treat or to prove you're right?,"To treat. Chemo's not killing anything. It's just hiding the real pRoblem. She's gonna crash. If we wait until she does crash, it might be too late."
"So the next step is what? I say no, and then you do something to make her crash so that I'll think you've proven your theory?",I would nEver do that.
"No, you won't. She's crashing!","on intercom from observation area You might want to check her IV. From here, it looks like saline instead of chemo."
"Yeah, they look identical.",Still. You should pRobably check.
You switched her meds?,How could I? I had no access.
to the neurosurgeon Close her back up.,Do the surgery.
There's no reason to,No reason not to. The stupidly dangerous part is already over with.
Is that someone's brain?,Except for the part that isn't brain.
"Hey, that's the Patient I You said she'd be fine.",I'm a better liar than you are.
"I swapped her meds. I mean, she's got a brain pRoblem. I coulda killed her.",Yup.
The computer will then process it and give us a picture of where to cut. Cool.,Excuse me?
"Sorry, I thought that's what you wanted to hear. You think all this is amazingly cool. And you have no one else, so you're paying a guy to listen. Sorry just trying to save you some cash.",I'm on the clock.
You think this is interesting to me? House?,looks at monitors next to him. I see it. Can you get it?
I think so.,Turns out you didn't kill her.
"Why are you just standing there, Dr. House?",How'd you know who it is?
I can smell you.,"Yeah, like you're a field of roses. He pushes the emergency buzzer for the nurses. The same two enter. Peppermint tea."
You Ever hear of the boy who cried wolf?,NEver really bought that.
Why are you telling me this stuff?,Because the world is not as ugly as you think it is.
It's gonna be bright. I know.,"The brain cells that weren't brain cells were in the way of processing visual information correctly. After the transplant, you could see, but not see."
I could see. I could read.,"Yeah, but it was dull, or foggy, or gray. I don't know. What I do know is that you were not seeing what Everyone else was seeing."
And now? Things are gonna be... beautiful?,Things'll be what they are. He removes the last of the bandages. How do I look?
You look sad.,Hey. Is there any way I could put you on retainer?
"What do you mean? It's her portrait. She looks at him, puzzled. What's wrong with it?",Why's this in here?
"First column, last entry.",looks at it and smiles Today is going to be a good day.
looks at it and smiles Today is going to be a good day. This him?,simultaneously No.
simultaneously No. Yes.,She means are you the private investigator whose bills I've tried to slip through as medical expenses?
"This hospital's not putting a private investigator on retainer. Nor is it gonna pay any more phony repairs on vending maParknes, cryostats, or elevators.",Information saves lives. Saving lives saves money.
leaving Uh! thank you.,You don't like her shoes. You like her legs.
It sounds less creepy if you say shoes.,"Less creepy, more gay."
That's my firm's motto. What is a cryostat?,No idea. WhoEver fixed ours is about to get stiffed. He balls up one of the sheets of paper and tosses it in the trash can. Two points.
"If he's like the other struggling artists I've known, he's also into drugs. We should! to House What are you looking at?","Apparently, a moron. One, ER routinely tests for drugs. If it was positive, we wouldn't be looking at this file. Two, who pays 12% interest on a car loan?"
How did you ? Did you run a credit check on me?,"No. That would be illegal. Interestingly enough, paying someone to run it for me, though! The entire team looks annoyed. What? It's part of my job."
Your job is to diagnose Patients.,Which I do with the team.
You've discovered that one of us has been hiding the ability to stretch or shrink themselves?,"No. I would nEver out someone's super powers. He wheels his chair to his desk and gives Thirteen a pile of papers that was there. This, on the other hand!"
"Who needs an MRI with contrast, we've established that. What do you got on Taub?",I got nothing on Taub.
"Could also be environmental. We should check his studio for toxins, mold, fungus.","Taub's wife, on the other hand!"
House. That's enough.,Dad's right. This is no time for gossip. A Patient desperately needs our help. Check his head and his House.
Check his head and his House. Can't Lucas,grabbing report out of Thirteen's hand Nope. He's very busy.
His place was clean.,"So is his head. Even with contrast, no masses, no lesions. A neurological symptom with no apparent neurological cause."
Time course means we can rule out cancer and MS.,Just leaves toxins or drugs.
You called Thirteen a moron for thinking it was drugs.,"Yeah. When she said it, she had other options. And I really just wanted to segue into her stupid loan and your"
He'll nEver consent to petrosal vein sampling.,Really?
He was nervous about an injection of contrast.,"Is his girlfriend hot? I'm not talking fEver here. I mean, is she all curvy and perky?"
"Very! and if he dies, it's good news for all of us, but",That explains why all his paintings suck. And what's wrong with him. He starts to leave.
Where are you going?,To tell him he may have a massive brain tumor.
To tell him he may have a massive brain tumor. He doesn't.,I know. I'm not a moron. It's drugs.
I know. I'm not a moron. It's drugs.,You seem to have a massive brain tumor.
entering He's Dr. House. He's pleased to meet you.,"We found no trace on any of your imaging, so we need to cut your head open. It's risky, but it's the only way to save your life."
"It's risky, but it's the only way to save your life. No.",Wrong answer.
I'm not allowed to say no?,You're not allowed to not be terrified.
His drug tests were clean.,Drug tests only test for drugs they've made tests for.
What are you talking about?,"Hottie thinks that he's a great artist, selling art to the rich and tasteful."
How Many trials are you on? Three.,Admirable.
You gonna tell Heather?,"as he's closing the door Couldn't, Even if I cared enough to want to."
"as he's closing the door Couldn't, Even if I cared enough to want to.",Not bad. You almost made it the whole day.
What'd you find out?,The point is to see how Everyone reacts. Let me go get the rest of the gang.
"Cut the crap, House.",Your wife has a separate bank account in her name only. She's been making weekly cash deposits for about a year now. No withdrawals! yet.
That's it? A bank account?,A secret bank account.
What makes you think it's a secret?,"Because if it wasn't, you'd call it the bank account."
"Damn. Always forget to use the right article when lying. It's not secret. We're refurnishing. We set the budget, set up an account. I just couldn't make it to the bank the day we opened it.","You're spending almost $100,000 on furniture?"
He said you told him he was better. What's happening? What's wrong with him?,She is hot.
She is hot.,Obviously the drugs weren't out of his system.
"None of these drugs, nor the drugs that they're derived from, are known for causing seizures.","By themselves, no. But three unproven, untested drugs? It's like the mod squad. No one could stop them."
Ridiculous that they let people take potentially dangerous drugs for money.,"Just to short-circuit that discussion, people should not be testing drugs because they're desperate."
"Ergo, welfare kills sick Parkldren. First drug",Why don't we call it bisexidrine?
"Bisexidrine is designed as an anticoagulant. Phase one indiCated some risk of nausea, ED and insomnia. Second drug.",Cuckoldisol.
She is having an affair?,Worse. Sex can be dismissed as hormonal or emotional. Can be easily regretted. Money is always a calculated decision.
My wife has her own bank account that House doesn't think I know about.,Shocking. Discuss.
Which is the third drug?,"Worldssorestkneesisil. Kutner smiles Cuddy used to have that title, by the way."
"There's a million ways these drugs could interact if they're doing what they're supposed to. If they're not, two million.","And it'd be interesting to know which of those interactions was causing the pRoblem. Unfortunately, we don't have to. We just have to stop the interacting."
If we don't know which,Stop them all. Put him on dialysis. Clear out his system.
"Rapid detox risks arrhythmia, another seizure, hepatic failure.","Difference is, we know what those risks are. Put him on dialysis."
You were right about the dialysis. He made it through the night without any more seizures or visual symptoms.,And I am going to be just as right after breakfast up in my office.
"You can screw with me all you want at work, but stay out of my personal life.",What did she say?
Did you just hear what I said?,I heard the part about you can screw with me at work all you want.Want my advice?
Of course not.,"Good, 'cause I have no idea what you should do. I only know what you're going to do. You're gonna"
I said I didn't want your advice.,I said this is not advice.
What purpose could that possibly serve?,None. Which is why I'm not saying you should. But you will.
What's your end game?,Where are you?
in the clinic waiting area At the track.,"That's, like, six miles away. How cool are these things?"
I feel like an idiot. The Woman sitting next to him shifts further away. I'm not giving you any more of my stuff.,You have those night vision goggles?
You have those night vision goggles? No.,You're lying.
You like making him miserable. You like driving people away from you.,He deserved to know the truth.
There was no truth until you dug it up.,"You do know that stuff exists Even when you can't see it, right?"
whispering It was a truth that mattered to him and a truth that mattered to her. Why did it matter to you?,"First of all, stop saying a truth. There is only one truth."
That may be true for you.,leaving the elevator and talking loudly Miserable people save more lives.
"Yeah, that makes sense.",Usually I have more of a fight on that one.
So why are you making Taub miserable?,I just said!
Could be his immune system's on hyperdrive. Cytokine storm.,studying papers in front of him Why would you pay for a three-year gym membership and only go twice?
"He just completed a total dialysis. If it was the drugs, he'd be better.",Or he'd be worse. pause I take it none of you saw Trainspotting.
You think swelling is a symptom of withdrawal?,You think it's a coincidence that three new symptoms cropped up as soon as we took him off the drugs?
It's possible some of the symptoms,"fiddling with pill bottle Either the drugs are the answer, or the drugs are a coincidence."
So how do we do it?,Hair of the drug that bit him.
"That's ridiculous. If it is the drugs, they're dangerous, and they've already caused","That's why we're gonna put him back on the drugs, and then wean him off again. Just much slower. The fellows look at Foreman. Why are you looking at him?"
Try it out.,You heard the boss! Go!
You heard the boss! Go!,Taub
Drugs could have set off a dorMant neurological condition.,"Good point. Coming clean can cause a lot of damage. Alienation, divorce."
My wife's buying me a car.,I was talking about the Patient.
You were wrong.,Divorce was metaphorical.
What about Kluver-Bucy syndrome? Bilateral lesions in the temporal lobes. Visual agnosia and hyper-sexuality are the key symptoms.,Good thing he's got that girlfriend.
You owe me an apology. Any rationalization you had for meddling in my private life disappeared when she had good reason,"You're right. Fact is, nothing I said applies. You had no reason to forgive her. Therefore, no reason to seek forgiveness. No reason to be an idiot."
Kluver-Bucy wouldn't explain the seizure or the cytokine storm. Withdrawal complications.,"Then again, she is handing you a giant gift that you don't think you deserve."
The damage can be a circulatory issue rather than structural. We wouldn't see that on the MRI.,Foreman's right.
Odd that a Man who can't run would own so Many pairs of sneakers.,hands Lucas his jacket You wanna hang this up when you're done?
I have to find something embarrassing about you.,"No, you don't."
"I ordered us Indian. Not too embarrassing, just something credible.","getting beer from the refrigerator Well, if you hand her that, she's not gonna need you anymore."
"Well, if I don't hand her anything, she'll think I'm incompetent.",I don't care if she thinks you're incompetent.
This isn't gonna work.,It's worked so far.
"No, I'm no good at lying.",I know. That's why your cover is that you want to do her. takes Vicodin
I like her. I don't wanna do her.,Then what's the point of liking her?
I meant I don't just want to do her. I like her. What do you think you're gonna find out about her?,Something! personal. Something embarrassing. I spend half my life negotiating with that Woman. Anything I can use to scare her into saying yes.
Anything I can use to scare her into saying yes. Okay.,Okay? You're okay with being paid twice to facilitate blackmail?
"Here it is. Circle of Willis, the vessels are narrow.","Narrow for you, normal for him. If there were pRoblems with the vessels, he'd have had symptoms long ago."
Not if something else changed.,Like?
His heart. He could have recently gotten an intermittent arrhythmia.,"I know heart and head start with the same three letters, but you gotta read all the way to the end."
"The experimental drug is causing arrhythmia, which causes low blood pressure. Combine that with those narrow vessels, the brain doesn't get enough blood. That causes all of his symptoms. If we can trigger the arrhythmia and identify it, we might be able to stop it from killing him.",Been home?
Been home? No.,Good. Do an EP study. Find the arrhythmia.
"How long you plan on keeping me from going home? Until you're convinced I'm a different person, one who won't do anything stupid?","Guilt fades quickly. By Wednesday, you'll be fine."
Right ventricle. And why do you want it to fade? Why do you suddenly care about my marriage?,Because! if it ain't broke
You obviously think it is broke.,You obviously think it ain't.
He's going into V-tach. What's wrong?,"Good news. The test is working. Your heart's freaking out, but it's cool that you're still conscious."
"Going again, charging to 120.",Have you been dyeing your hair? He's inspecting Brandon's temples.
"No. House, clear.",Right. steps back
steps back Ow.,The hair is growing in red.
His heart rate is stabilized.,to Taub Does your theory include any genetic mutations that could cause his hair to change color? Either he's lying about dyeing! or just dying.
to Taub Does your theory include any genetic mutations that could cause his hair to change color? Either he's lying about dyeing! or just dying.,Red hair means it's not Kluver-Bucy. Melanin affects hair color. What affects melanin?
Hormone panels were all normal. Age.,He's turning prematurely crimson?
A genetic disorder. Waardenburg syndrome causes arrhythmias and can change hair color.,And make you deaf. Next.
Found a long QT interval. I think it's RoMano-Ward syndrome.,Explains the irregular heart rhythms.
Explains the irregular heart rhythms.,But not the ginger nut.
"If he's got RoMano's, he's got at least five gene mutations. Not a big leap to think he has others that would give him the hair.",It also gives him the likelihood of sudden and unexpected death.
Beta blockers don't work. His heart can't handle an ICD.,Pete Best.
"Pete Best was actually a great drummer, but I assume you mean the Patient needs a cardiac sympathectomy?","PRobably should have just said that, huh?"
"Start cutting nerves, you risk his swallowing, vocal cords, sweating.",So he saves a fortune on karaoke maParknes and deodorant.
You think he's stable enough for surgery?,"If he was, he wouldn't need it."
"This isn't progressing. It's there, then it's not, then it is. It's a new symptom, intermittence.",It's irrelevant. He's pacing and the other two follow him.
Since when is a new symptom irrelevant?,Since it points towards the same disease. Intermittence can fit with RoMano-Ward. We still need to do a sympathectomy.
Maybe we missed something. Toxins.,"When? When you checked Every bottle, Every can, Every tube of paint? Or when you detoxed him twice?"
He's lost weight since he got here.,That's a symptom of trying to cram hospital food down a throat he can barely get air down.
"It's not a symptom, but what if the toxins were stored in his fat cells a year ago, and now they're being released into his bloodstream?",So where you gonna get this old paint? City dump?
On his old paintings. We know he hasn't sold one in ages. But there weren't Many in his studio. He's hid them somewhere.,"If you're wrong, he could drop dead from RoMano-Ward at any moment. You okay with that?"
Just give me a few hours.,You got one.
"It's not the paint, it's the drugs.",He's not on the drugs. He sits down.
"I know it doesn't make sense, but I'm looking at his paintings for the last six months. They're normal April, June, and August. But they're distorted May, July, September. He shines a light on a different painting as he names the month each was painted. Every other month, he was having visual agnosia, because Every other month he was on all three drugs simultaneously. The statin was one month on, one month off. I don't know why the symptoms keep coming and going, but it is the drugs.",They're hiding under the stairs.
In the fat? That doesn't make sense. These drugs aren't fat soluble.,"I said stairs, not closet. What was the last drug he was on before the drugs he was on when the symptoms started?"
I'm not sure. I think,Antacid.
How do you know?,"It makes sense. Also, I'm looking at the file."
She didn't buy it.,Damn. So you didn't get anything.
Nothin'. We pRobably overstepped. You're really not the cheerleader type.,"On the other hand, I figured she pRobably wouldn't figure me as the photoshopping a photo and planting it in an obscure college paper type either."
"Heh. Yeah, about that. I took a little trip to your alma mater.",You took a little trip 150 miles.
"Online, by phone. I meant I did research. House sits and picks up a guitar. They start improvising together. That's a real photo, isn't it? no answer Wow, that is humiliating.",There was a girl.
"Even more so. That's too bad. You wanted her to see you in a different light, and! not only didn't she see it! She didn't Even beliEve it was possible.","You know, people hate people who have theories about people."
You want me to back off?,Would you?
Are you okay?,I picked Cameron's pocket down in ER. I came up with a doozy.
Your mother called twice.,"She's still healthy. This 25-year-old Woman, on the other hand!"
Her messages sounded kind of urgent.,"Well, that's the way women sound when their spouse of 50 years dies. He goes into his office, hanging his cane from the top of the doorframe as he enters."
Your dad died? Are you,Yep.
"House, call your mom.","What are you, my mom?"
We can continue this differential in five minutes.,"Are those bags under your eyes? You were up all night. You told her, didn't you?"
"I don't know what your daddy issues are, but don't deflect them on me.",to the others Told his wife he's been getting some strange. She kicked his adulterous tuchus to the curb.
"Anybody read Parknese? Otherwise, we have no idea what these doctors did to her.","Kutner, you're sort of Asian, right? Get it translated."
"What about Meckel's diverticulum? If the surgeons didn't remove the diverticulum, it can cause pain, bleeding.",Too high up for a colonoscopy. CT could miss it. Ultrasound's fastest. And since I'm fastest with the ultrasound!
"House, let me do the ultrasound. You need to deal with your dad and stop","I'm not deflecting because I'm avoiding something deep. I'm deflecting because I'm avoiding something shallow. Seriously, I'm fine. I didn't Even like the Man."
"I'm not deflecting because I'm avoiding something deep. I'm deflecting because I'm avoiding something shallow. Seriously, I'm fine. I didn't Even like the Man.",No Meckel's. He hands her a box of tissues. Were you there for the rice or the reeducation camps?
I was there to track down my biological parents.,"Like a salmon returning to the stream where it was born. Did you become whole again, or did you get eaten by bears?"
They denied my existence.,"Four parents, and not one of them taught you to cover your mouth."
"Doctor, we're her parents.",I'm just a technician. Her doctors will be by later. You can schmooze then.
"Can you let them know that we, uh, we went by her apartment and collected all her medication.",I'm a technician and a doctor.
"quietly, to House Did her drinking cause this?",No. He finds a plastic baggie that interests him.
Can you tell her it did?,Licorice root.
"Uh, no, thanks. I'm good.",I threw it to you for a reason. That's what the Parknese doctors gave her. It contains glycyrrhizin.
quietly They were treating her for! very quietly SARS?,"Not very effectively. But SARS explains the cough, causes hypoperfusion, which explains the ischemic bowel. It's perfect."
Lung involvement isn't very sEvere.,"getting on elevator Okay, well, so call it ARS. Start her on ribavirin and interferon."
Sorry about your father.,I'm not. Are we done emoting now?
"If there's anything I can do, just","You know, you're right. I don't think I can sleep alone tonight. Cuddy produces a syringe. And you can tell me that that is liquid Vicodin."
"We're giving IG shots to Everyone who came in contact with your Patient. Shockingly, none of the nurses volunteered to administer yours. He starts to roll up his sleEve. It goes better in a large muscle. Drop your pants.","He stands, unbuckles his jeans and leans on the desk. You know, I usually pay tens of dollars to hear that."
gives him the shot The funeral's tomorrow.,My mom called you?
"There is a 340 flight out of Newark. If you leave now, you can be in Lexington tonight. Your mother wants you to deliver a eulogy.","Eulogy, from the Greek for good word. Now, if she asked me to deliver a bastardogy, I'd be happy to"
"Then be a grown-up. Call your mother back and tell her that you're sick with grief, but you're too busy to be there.",She knows when I'm lying.
I am not doing this because I care.,Cuddy drugged me. She! My mom didn't call Cuddy. She called you. I knew you couldn't stay away. I knew you loved me too much.
I'm doing this for your mom.,I'm not doing this at all.
"I'm not doing this at all. If there were something to be done, I would have done it in the year he spent dying. He checks his pockets. You took my Vicodin? I'm in pain. Wilson pulls the Vicodin bottle from his inside pocket, opens it and gives House a pill, all without looking at him. One? So the Vicodin is my leash. One'll take the edge off, but it won't give me enough relief for an escape back to Plainsboro. He swallows it.",Where's my phone? Wilson ignores him. It's the team. It's their ring tone. nothing Forget it. The Patient's blood is on your hands.
House? You there?,I'm being held against my will. Call the police!
We need to pinpoint which defect she has so we can start her on the right anticoagulant. Draw her blood. Let's find out which genetic gift her genetic parents gave her.,"Thanks for calling. He disconnects the phone. My ring tone for you is Dancing Queen, by Abba."
"My ring tone for you is Dancing Queen, by Abba. Nicole?",I need to pee.
There's a rest stop in five miles.,Cane.
The restroom's right there. You can make it on your own.,I suppose I could talk about the summer he decided he wasn't speaking to me.
"You don't want to say anything, don't say anything, but go. Tell your mom you're sad for her.","Just by being there, I'd be lying."
"She wants to think, for a moment, that she had a happy family. So give her a gift lie!","Give me my cane, I'll go to the damn funeral."
"Give me my cane, I'll go to the damn funeral.",I said I'd go to the funeral. I didn't say when.
This is why we prefer inside.,"You actually keep a flashlight that doesn't need batteries in the trunk? Next to the jacket, emergency water, nail clippers, tooth brush, space blanket"
"You know, those aren't just my car keys. My House keys are on there too. Amber gave me that key chain.","No, she didn't."
"Is pRobably responding to a Parkldish, pointless act of petulance.",The struggle to resist one's captors is nEver pointless. Vive la rsistance!
"Well, I hate to break it to you, Che, but simple delay won't work. Your mother will hold the funeral till we get there.","shakes head My father was a punctual Man, beholden to time. Two minutes late for dinner, you didn't eat. My mother would nEver disrespect him by starting the funeral late."
"Yeah, yeah, you clearly have no issues to work through.","Come on, forget the keys. Call a locksmith. We'll go inside and play guess that smell with the truckers while we're waiting. Join me on the dark side."
So he was a bastard. He was still your father. You're biologically programmed to have feelings for him.,"No, I'm not."
Feelings aren't rational. I know you have trouble with anything that can't be quantified and counted.,He's not my biological father. Wilson looks at him. I figured it out when I was 12.
"Of course. You were a brilliant, socially isolated 12-year-old, and you create a parallel universe in which your life doesn't suck.","I look at the facts. First of all, he was deployed on training exercises off Okinawa during the time I had to be conceived."
"And since you're 150 years old, air travel was impossible.",His second toe is longer than his big toe. Mine isn't.
This is sad. You don't beliEve your mother screwed around,I have a distinctive red birthmark on my scalp that matches a certain friend of the family.
"If you beliEved this story, you wouldn't be telling me about his birthmarks. You'd be telling me about the genetic testing you had done. House notices a police car ahead of them. And since you haven't mentioned it, obviously, you didn't do it. Because you don't want to House, what are you doing? House has jammed his cane against the accelerator. Get your get off the there's a cop!",Uh-oh.
I think we may need to call House again.,You lost track of your speed? I think that was Hitler's excuse. Lost track of the Jews. No one held him responsible.
"I'm not playing, House.",You were protecting me. Anybody in their right mind would have ratted me out.
I'm just trying to speed things along. You are going to this funeral.,Make it fast. I don't want to miss the anal cavity search.
Looks like a mass in the pancreas.,Not to me. This is radio. And I want a full play-by-play.
"Just get out of the car, sir.",Cyst?
Large cyst. Something going on there?,"Wilson's getting arrested. How large? SUV sized, or mid-range sedan?"
Seriously? What'd you do?,"I'm obviously joking. If Wilson was getting handcuffed on the hood of his car, would I be carrying on a differential?"
Diameter is at least eight centimeters.,whistles Is it in the tail or in the head?
"at House's window You too, sir. Out of the car.",ignoring him We've got a construction site. A steamroller is plowing
This is a waste of time. He leaves.,"I need that phone call. I'm a doctor, and when someone tries to call you three times, it's code for pick up the damn phone before someone dies."
I'm sure there's other smart doctors.,You'd be surprised.
to House You told me you'd taken care of this.,I did.
First words you Ever said to me.,I took care of it. You must've screwed up somehow.
It's a really old warrant. Isn't there a statute of limitations on this kind of thing?,It's suspended when you flee the state.
I was fresh out of med school. I didn't know anybody at the convention.,"You heard the Man, Wilson. You don't have to explain."
"very angry I am not gonna sit here wasting time just so you can avoid your father's funeral! Costello looks at them, interested.",He's my father. I have the right to avoid his funeral.
Leave a Tender Moment is a good song.,It's a great song. He was out of line.
"So I I asked the Man to stop, politely.","Yeah, you yelled politely."
"I was polite the first couple of times, but courtesy made no impression on this ass. So I threw a bottle into the mirror, which successfully conveyed my message.",And smashed a ten-foot antique mirror. And set an example to two other patrons who threw shot glasses.
I think I have the picture. I assume you're the guy who was playing the song.,"No, I was the guy who bailed him out."
"This guy was a total stranger to you, and you bailed him out?",It was a boring convention. Had to have somebody to drink with.
"And there's the foundation of our entire friendship. If you hadn't been bored one weekend, it wouldn't Even exist.","Hey, there were 3,000 people at that convention. You were the one I thought wasn't boring. That says something."
It also says something that you lied to me about getting the charges dropped!,I got a Lawyer. He cut a deal. You didn't call the guy? You have to show up at the arraignment. Everybody knows that.
reading a fax You can go.,What? He he's a fugitive from justice. That whole story was lies. He stabbed a Man.
unlocking the handcuffs Louisiana doesn't want to pay to get you back.,Forget Louisiana. He was driving recklessly through your comatose village. Do they put lead in the jelly doughnuts here?
They're not now. It's not the gallstones.,"Well, of course it's not gallstones. Who thought it was gallstones?"
You said steamroller.,I also said construction site.
Gallstones could cause a pancreatic cyst.,"to Wilson Will you just turn around. The thing is two hours over already, and that's the third time we passed that colonial with the cross burning out front."
I'm not lost.,I'm not talking about what caused the cyst. I'm talking about what the cyst caused. Everything.
"Cysts are symptoms, not diagnoses.","Unless it's a multiple cyst, with connections to other organs! like a steamroller."
Chase isn't gonna go groping around when she's got kidney failure. Bubbles.,Is that your new stripper name?
"Yes. And also, we inject bubbles into the cyst and follow where they drift. If they end up in the other organs, we know you're right, cut it out, she's fine.",Bubbles is right. Go echo. He hangs up.
"I'm so glad you're here. Oh, it's a load off of my mind just to see you. She hugs House. Thank you, James.","Mom, how could you delay the funeral?"
"Honey, your dad is dead. He's not going to care. Do you know what you're going to say?",I don't know. Just let the minister or one of his buddies from the corps!
"The lord is my shepherd, I shall not want!",quietly to Wilson I am not talking We were strangers who shared some geography 30 years ago.
"Right, he had no influence on you at all. The father who was compulsive about punctuality.",His issue. Which I deliberately made not my issue.
"Thereby making it your issue. Compulsively showing up four hours late, ignoring discipline, ignoring rules.","looking around Oh, God, he's here."
"Who's here? looks The one you're pretending is your father? Nice pick. He looks like Sean Connery. So back when you were devising this fantasy, did you tell your father Dad, I refuse to recognize your existence because I have chosen James Bond as my dad?",I used different words.
What? Hearing that your own son hates you so much he's replaced you in his mind? That's gotta suck. How did he take it?,I already told you. He didn't speak to me for a summer.
"at the podium It means more to me than than I can say to have all of you here today. And now, uh, our son Gregory would like to say a few words. House doesn't move. Greg?",There's a lot of people here today.
"There's a lot of people here today. Including some from the corps. And I notice that Every one of them is either my father's rank or higher. And that doesn't surprise me. Because, if the test of a Man is how he treats those he has power over, it was a test my father failed. Wilson looks embarrassed. Blythe looks worried. This Man you're eager to pay homage to, he was incapable of admitting any point of view but his own. He punished failure, and he did not accept anything less than",He loved doing what he did.
Put it back.,"Well, he's not gonna miss it."
I'm done enabling. You can't Even let them put him in the ground without making it serve your agenda?,You really want to do this in front of Everybody? You wanna punish me or them?
"How can I still feel surprise? You would take, Even this, a moment of real huMan grief, and turn it into a farce.","Oh, cut the crap. You enjoy what I do. I nEver had to force you. You like coming along for the ride."
"Yes, that's why I'm cheering you on now.",This is about you needing to be prepared for the worst.
Don't bring Amber into this.,"And you weren't ready. That makes you angry. The world sucks, and you didn't have time to brace yourself."
What happened out there is your show!,You're scared to death of losing anyone that matters. So you dump the person who matters the most to you!
I'm not scared to death. I'm moving forward!,Because no one can take away from you what you no longer have.
"Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho. Your father's death is about you. Amber's death is about you. I can't imagine why someone wouldn't want to be your friend!","Admit it, you're angry and you're scared of losing me."
"I'm not angry, I'm not scared.",Admit it.
I'm not afraid.,Admit it.
I've lost people. It happens.,Admit it. Admit it!
"What are you, five? Stop repeating","Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Come on, admit it. Admit it!"
"Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Admit it. Come on, admit it. Admit it!",Still not boring.
Did you know I was gonna do that? Because I didn't know I was gonna do that.,I know you have trouble losing people.
"So I peeked at the return address. Diamond, Fairbairn.",Divorce attorneys. Your first wife had just served you with papers.
Did you know that when you bailed me out? Were you! doing something nice for me?,What did I say about being boring? He picks up his phone and starts dialing.
Hello? It's House. turns on speakerphone,How'd the bubble test go?
House is thinking House?,The images aren't grainy.
They sure look grainy.,I've seen pictures of you where you look tall.
Atrial myxoma is more likely.,MRI for a better view. And call me back and tell me you're embarrassed because my eyesight is better 500 miles away. I need a phone number.
MRI for a better view. And call me back and tell me you're embarrassed because my eyesight is better 500 miles away. I need a phone number.,"I'm a doctor in New Jersey, treating one of your clients. A young Woman looking for her biological parents."
"You know, you could just wait for the MRI to have your curiosity satisfied.",What person who is nothing like me are you saying that to?
What person who is nothing like me are you saying that to?,"Did the parents look tan? The disease she has is genetic, which means they should have it too."
They don't look more tan than anyone else.,Discolored teeth?
They're farmers the village doesn't Even have a dentist.,Right. Thanks.
"But if it matters, I'm not convinced they were her parents.",Why not?
"Because they said they have no daughter. The Man was adaMant, and the Woman seemed confused and frightened.",Thank you. He hangs up and turns to Wilson. Differential. Say you're a middle-aged Parknese Woman!
Say you're a middle-aged Parknese Woman! Fine.,Say it.
I'm a middle-aged Parknese Woman.,"Girl comes to you, says that she's your long-lost daughter. Why would you be frightened?"
I'm frightened because she's a threat? Maybe she knows something?,She hasn't seen you since she was an infant.
Maybe an inheritance issue.,They're peasants.
Her very presence is a threat. She what year was she born?,'83.
She's not supposed to be alive. Parkna introduced the one-Parkld policy in 1979. Say they didn't want a girl. They tried to kill her.,Maybe the baby doesn't die. Maybe the father panics or regrets it. Takes the baby to an orphanage. Maybe he doesn't tell his wife.
Who freaks out like she's seen a ghost 25 years later when the girl shows up.,Why does attempted murder from 25 years ago suddenly become relevant to her health now?
Maybe they gave her something toxic. It would have to be fat-soluble.,"This is fun, isn't it?"
"This is fun, isn't it?",Let me see the MRI.
She started vomiting as soon as we started the scan.,Then let her vomit through the MRI.
I already had this conversation with Wilson just go with it. Poison?,Buddha wouldn't make it worse.
"Maybe the weight stressed her back, which",Makes sense if she's nEver lifted anything in her life.
She actually didn't get sick till she tried lifting it that second time. I'm guessing the weight changed.,epiphany Anybody have Taub's pager number?
epiphany Anybody have Taub's pager number? What's up?,"Maybe give him a call. If he tosses that switch on the MRI, she's dead. X-ray her brain."
"Maybe give him a call. If he tosses that switch on the MRI, she's dead. X-ray her brain.","Pins. Push them through the soft fontanelle of an infant, you skewer the brain, and the hair hides the entry wounds. It's the perfect crime."
What changed at the temple?,Same thing that changed in the MRI.
I hear your Patient's gonna be all right.,Is that why you're here? A colleague checking up on a Patient?
Something goin' on?,"I'm celebrating. He hands Wilson a sheet of paper from his desk. Wilson looks at it, then back at House. My mom hated him too."
"Your DNA test showed no match? That's incredible. At the age of 12, you actually figured out your father wasn't your birth father? That's what you wanted, wasn't it? Why should it depress you?",It doesn't depress me. Doesn't make any difference at all. That's what depresses me.
"Well, I guess nobody gets to choose who their parents are. I'm not Even sure anymore if we get to choose who our friends are. pause I spoke with Cuddy. She hasn't filled my position yet.",If you're coming back just because you're attracted to the shine of my neediness! Wilson smiles slightly I'd be okay with that.
"I'm coming back because you're right. That strange, annoying trip we just took was the most fun I've had since Amber died.",You hungry? Wilson nods. House gets up and they head for the door. House stops. Wilson.
Wilson. Yeah?,My dad's dead.
I don't know. House.,putting up a finger to stop her Eh.
walking toward him I have a case I think you might be interested in.,turning quickly and heading out of his office Not now.
A 26-year-old Woman had a tonic clonic seizure.,What about me speeding away says to you let's chat?
"History of fatigue, and two years ago she had a retinal vein occlusion.",She's diabetic.
"No, she's not. And she has no history of hypertension. She holds out the file to House, which he ignores",approaParkng Wilson's office It can wait.
approaParkng Wilson's office It can wait.,I knew I should've set up a video camera. Stay there.
I knew I should've set up a video camera. Stay there.,"Oh, my goodness. I played a practical joke on my best friend, and he's badly injured."
"Oh, my goodness. I played a practical joke on my best friend, and he's badly injured.",I wish I had learned this valuable lesson earlier. I was waiting by my window for an hour. Why are you late?
I had a breakfast meeting at Mickey's Diner with the Mercy people to tell them! Wilson sees a donut on a plate and a carton of milk behind the bookshelf I'm coming back to work here. He pulls the plate and the milk toward himself Sorry if it interfered with your plan to maim me. pause Donut's a nice touch. He takes a bite of the donut,turning and opening the door to leave It's my way of saying welcome back. House leaves. Cameron is still waiting in the hallway
The seizure could be the result of dehydration or something neurological. She holds out the file again which House takes this time,looking at the file Or the ecstasy you found in her system.
"According to Dr. Hadley, the Patient took the drugs about five hours before the seizure, so!",obviously curious What does Thirteen know about it?
"Uh, apparently she was with the Patient last night.",looking at the file again At 300 AM? Cameron shrugs
looking at the file again At 300 AM? Cameron shrugs,"lecherously Oh, yeah! PentHouse forum meets medical mystery. Maybe there is a God. He heads back to his office"
"lecherously Oh, yeah! PentHouse forum meets medical mystery. Maybe there is a God. He heads back to his office",Empty transient sex?
Not diagnostically relevant.,Depends what we're trying to diagnose. It's how steep of a spiral you're on.
Also not diagnostically relevant. Retinal vein occlusion was fixed. Her doctor said it was a venous anomaly.,Is he in this room?
She parties till 300 AM. That's why she's always tired.,Yet you seem fine.
Makes sense. Bone marrow's in overdrive. Too Many platelets. to Thirteen Sorry.,"Thirteen, go stick a needle in your girlfriend's pelvis. And no, that one wasn't a metaphor. Suck out some marrow. That one was."
"Thirteen, go stick a needle in your girlfriend's pelvis. And no, that one wasn't a metaphor. Suck out some marrow. That one was.",I like to watch. He follows her out the door
I can handle this alone.,"You've already handled it. That's why you need a chaperone. Of course, I'm a very permissive, understanding chaperone. So feel free to ignore me."
"You've already handled it. That's why you need a chaperone. Of course, I'm a very permissive, understanding chaperone. So feel free to ignore me.","You know, if you're in the mood to start kissing, or groping, or showering."
You're Dr. House?,I assume my name came up last night in the form of a moan.
"WhatEver you think we did, we we did. And then some.",Lights on or off?
Do you have a medical rationalization for that one?,Light sensitivity.
Light sensitivity. On.,"Figured she had more shame than that. Did she talk dirty, or did you rely on vague hand signals? House is writing something on a clipboard"
"She's, uh, pretty direct about what she wants.",I'm learning so much.
I'm learning so much.,"Okay, score the score. Scale of one to ten."
wincing from the pain SEven.,holding up a piece of paper with a large number 7 written on it Finally got one right. Thirteen looks thoroughly disgusted
You want to investigate him because he ate a donut?,He claimed he had a morning meeting at Mickey's Diner.
What do you think you'll find out?,"I'm worried that he might be, a spy."
He's been gone four months. You're worried the friendship has changed.,I'm just not sure if he's working for Hirohito or the New England Patriots.
You played a practical joke on him. He didn't laugh.,"I need something to lord over him, a lie"
He didn't try to retaliate. He moralized.,He always moralized.
He always moralized and got Even. He hasn't fired back.,Things always change.
And that sucks.,Yeah. Find out where he was. House gets up and leaves
We had to use paddles to stabilize the Patient's heart.,"Eye issue, brain issue, now a heart issue. Sounds like a real case to me."
"Yeah, I get it. I was wrong. Can we move on?","You're just upset! Because the whole time she was with you, she was thinking of my huge, thRobbing! Diagnostic skills. Drugs would explain Everything."
"This morning, you rejected drugs.",That's when I thought that Thirteen was right and was just jerking her around. Cardiac arrest means she could be a serious user.
"That means that something she did at my place set this off. Either she brought drugs in, or she grabbed something from my medicine cabinet. And that means my place needs to be searched. Now, I'd be happy to do that myself, but unfortunately that would be far less titillating for House, so he's about to come up with some convoluted medical reason why I have to stay here while he goes through my stuff.",Patient's dad had bypass surgery. Means she's a candidate for atherosclerosis. She needs an ultrasound. That was much less convoluted than what you just said.
"I'm not giving you my keys. If you want to do this, I'm going.",Who could pick a lock?
I'll go. Make sure he doesn't steal any underwear.,You're a disgrace to your stereotype. Move over.
Think you can pick a lock faster than me?,No need to pick. House shows Foreman a key and uses it to unlock the door
Nice. Steal from your employees.,NEver. I had my dick make keys when I hired him to dick up the team.
NEver. I had my dick make keys when I hired him to dick up the team.,Always imagined she'd have a sex swing in the living room.
Give me my key.,Don't have your key.
You expect me to beliEve that you hired Lucas to investigate Everyone except for me?,Waste of money.
I already know Everything about you.,pointing with his cane Thirteen had her purse. That's gotta be the Patient's. Check it for drugs. I call shotgun on the bedroom.
You know that I stole a car when I was a teenager. You know that my mom has Alzheimer's. You know nothing else. Foreman has put on latex gloves and is searParkng the purse,Want me to have you investigated? When did you get so needy?
Purse is clean.,Last night wasn't the first time that Thirteen brought home some strange.
You found her diary,No toys.
"No toys. You sleep with the same person over and over, that's when you need accessories. First time is plenty exciting on its own. He takes something from the drawer Unless!",You think an asthma inhaler could be used as a sex toy? He gets up of the bed and gives the inhaler a squirt
There are ways of getting to know people without committing felonies.,People interest me. Conversations don't.
both are smiling Like Thirteen.,to Thirteen Brown recluse. Found it at your apartment. Their venom can cause seizures and heart pRoblems. Unless the ultrasound showed anything
No. What room did you find it in?,"Bathroom. Nice bidet, by the way. Very refreshing."
I don't have a bidet.,Oh. Spider's not the only interesting thing I found. He pulls the inhaler out of his jacket pocket
You moved? Who cares?,He doesn't.
Spider bite doesn't explain anything unless the Patient was actually bitten by a spider. He stands up I'll do the exam.,Don't be ridiculous. That would be inappropriate. It'd be better if a Woman gropes her. There's no sexual tension that way. Thirteen stands to go do the exam
"Blood test confirms low potassium lEvels. Explains the numbness in her hip. It's not good, but I think we've got time for at least one or two comments about my personal life.",Which you just wasted with that comment about my comments. Low potassium means her heart pRoblem was a symptom of a kidney pRoblem. What caused the kidney pRoblem?
Could be IgA nephropathy.,Not without blood in the urine.
Not without blood in the urine. PSAGN?,Not with normal blood pressure.
"Renal tubular acidosis. Her kidney's don't filter acid out of the blood. Excess acid drives down potassium, causes kidney calcifications.","If it's RTA, all she needs is sodium bicarbonate for the acid and surgery to remove the calcifications."
"If it's RTA, all she needs is sodium bicarbonate for the acid and surgery to remove the calcifications. CT her kidneys. If you find calcifications, we have our diagnosis. House continues on down the corridor, Thirteen heads back to Spencer's room",What's he doing now?
He's playing that carjacking video game. He'd get a lot farther if he didn't stop at all the red lights.,Maybe he was doing something he thinks I'll mock him for.
Maybe he was doing something he thinks I'll mock him for. Like!,Just about anything.
You don't think it's that.,I don't think it's just about anything?
"You don't think it's about anything trivial. If you weren't worried, you wouldn't be sitting in my car.",Maybe he's seeing a shrink.
Maybe he's seeing a shrink.,Doesn't matter if it isn't.
The breathing pRoblem started after we fixed her kidney pRoblem. Means the RTA isn't the underlying cause.,Where's Thirteen?
Traffic's bad. She's pRobably just,Not here.
"It's not her lungs. No masses, no infiltrates.","Her lungs are working, but she still can't breathe."
That could signal autoimmune or some kind of dystrophy as the underlying cause.,There's only one way to find out if her airway failed.
Just spoke to my brother.,"And by brother, you mean?"
I mean my parents' other son.,Wow. Same dad.
"Got a call last week from your PI. You lied. You did have me investigated. You've been taunting the team with what you've learned, but you nEver came after me. grinning Means you couldn't find anything.",You're right.
grinning Means you couldn't find anything. You're right.,"That's because you haven't done anything stupid, spontaneous, or Even vaguely interesting since you were 17. And that's just sad. The elevator door closes"
to House I found her in the clinic giving herself IV fluids.,At least you could've let her finish. She looks terrible.
She has a fresh nightclub stamp on her wrist. She's in no condition to practice.,"Unless this is a prelude to an actual spanking, there's no reason for me to be"
But I can suspend you until you do.,to Cuddy Because she went to a nightclub in her free time?
"to Cuddy Because she went to a nightclub in her free time? Or because she had sex in her free time? Patient was undergoing routine surgery for RTA. Didn't need Thirteen here for that. And I don't need you making my employees punch a clock or pee in a cup. to Thirteen, nodding his head toward the door. Let's go. Thirteen hesitates",opening the door Come on. Cuddy looks stunned
as they walk into the clinic area Thank you.,"By the way, they stop the surgery was not routine, Patient stopped breathing and you missed a differential. You're fired."
What? You just defended me.,"No, I just prEvented you from getting a drug test. PRobably saved your career. I'm already taking responsibility for one doctor with a drug habit. He pops a Vicodin"
I don't have a drug habit.,The slutty party girl is fun till she pukes on your shoes. Then she's just a pain in the ass. He leaves Thirteen looking confused
The slutty party girl is fun till she pukes on your shoes. Then she's just a pain in the ass. He leaves Thirteen looking confused,I haven't sat on this couch for four months. It remembers my cheeks. I miss this.
Me too. Me trying to work. You interrupting.,"Oh, come on. Your Patients can wait five minutes. Get me caught up. Come on, what did you do? Travel? Did you get a new hobby? Did you meet someone?"
"Actually, yes. I sort of, started, dating someone.",Great. What does she do? Is she! an actress?
No. Why would you think that?,I just figured you'd want something a little more! Exciting!
"She's not! You're gonna find out anyway because you're gonna meet her. She's! a prostitute. Used to be. She made some mistakes. Single mom, had some drug issues. But! she's so smart. She wants to go to law school. And! I told her I'd help her with tuition.",How long have you known her?
I knew you'd be like this.,I asked a question.
House! You are a drug addict. You go to prostitutes. You can't be judgmental.,And yet.
"Please, don't do this to me. I was hurting, and I wanted to feel good. I didn't expect it! to go this way. I! Amber! Said that she wanted me to move on. That she wanted me to! Be happy.

"Lung cysts plus all her other symptoms could be Amyloidosis, which we can Manage. Or pulmonary fibrosis which",Thank you. My employees can take care of it from here. He sits down behind his desk We need to biopsy the cysts.
You fired me because I screwed up. I just proved I can pull my weight.,All you proved is you know how to make an entrance.
"House, she deserves another shot. She found the cysts, saved the Patient.",Who wouldn't have needed saving if Thirteen had shown up at the differential in the first place.

Jumping to a transplant when we don't know what she,I know she has a blood disorder.
"Yeah, I get it. But she'll nEver survive total body irradiation.",So we don't radiate her. Her marrow's nearly wiped out already. Counts almost zero.

There are dozens of other things this rash could indiCate. I want a full fetal work up.,You're losing it. That's what happens when you have kids. Ceaseless crying and nagging leads to irrational fears. It's impressive that you didn't wait for the actual crying and nagging.

Only you could see that as a bad thing.,It's a fake thing. There's no unconditional love. It's just unconditional need. Don't make this Parkld a victim of your biological clock.

You're not? You just told me,The wrong answer. You can give the mom more blood. You can't give the fetus more lungs.

"If she can't handle your insanity, she can't handle a baby.",That's exactly my point.
"No, it isn't. You're feeling threatened because she's going onto high school and leaving you behind to repeat the eighth grade.",She's sleeping with the math teacher to get a diploma.
Adoption is cheating? Are they giving her a fake kid?,"That's the pRoblem. She gets to have a relationship with a kid, but she can't handle one with an adult. So she's gonna kill it."
"Well, it does seem cleaner. House tosses the box on the table. I've seen the file. She's making a judgment call.",Decisions are nEver made in a vacuum. He takes back the Patient file.

Dr. House explained to you that all surgeries carry risk? You could die.,"And if you don't do it, daddy will die."
Stop pressuring her.,Sorry. Daddy's perfectly healthy. But we want you to give him a kidney anyway because it'd be cool if he had three.

So you do know what they have?,Yeah.
But they aren't gonna be fine?,No idea. They might be.
Why the hell would you say they were?,To make them happy.
For two seconds?,"Technically, to see if they can be happy. We should've seen a grin, a twinkle, a sigh of relief, something."
They're sick. They're tired.,"They're anhedonic, incapable of experiencing pleasure. Something's bushwhacked their dopamine receptors."
They're depressed. Mom's dead. Dad's dying. You should know that being bummed isn't necessarily a pathology.,Being bummed doesn't explain their lack of friends or their indifference to each other.
"But if you can't feel pleasure, what's with the cocaine?","Really? Is that why you do drugs? Because you're happy? Most people do 'em because they want to be happy. His subconscious craved it, needed it."

Take-out menus. But I'm hoping you'll come up with a better answer when Everyone asks what we're talking about. Last night,Forget it.
"I know this is awkward, but we need to talk.",There's a reason that we've evolved a feeling of awkwardness. It tells us not to talk about things.
I was emotional because of the adoption falling through. And you actually let your huMan side show for a moment. That is why we kissed. I just want to say thank you for not! taking advantage.,"You're welcome. Any time you want to stop kissing, I'm there for you."
What did Cuddy want?,"I kinda hit that last night, so now she's all on my jock."
The only equipment we have is a sonogram and a portable X-ray.,"What part of olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole don't you understand?"

There's a reason.,Yes. Those large things in her bra.
"You were hiding it from me, means it meant something to you.","Yeah, I fiendishly concealed it within the phrase I hit that."

You would've said interesting no matter what the answer.,"And no matter what the answer, it would've been interesting. No engagement. Commitment issues. His place, control issues. Not sure whose, but interesting."
"Yeah, moves much faster this way.",Where was the Patient when he had his first seizure?
In his entry hallway getting his mail.,"Getting close to the outdoors, spooked him, raised his BP. Use that fear. Bring him outside."
"He punched out a fireMan. We're doctors, not bouncers.",Okay. So bring the outside to him.
Okay. So bring the outside to him.,"Floors tapping the floor with his cane, genuine wood."
Why are they here?,They overheard me announce the half price bank foreclosure in the ER waiting room. Where's Everybody?

"House, get them out of here.",Easy for you to say. You're not gonna be making some serious capital gains.
This is cruel.,"And leaving him undiagnosed is what, altruistic? Procedure worked. He's seizing. What do you see?"
Normal theta. Normal delta. This isn't a seizure.,It's something.
Stomach's killing me.,See? It's something.
Partial small bowel obstruction.,Blockage explains the pain. What explains the blockage plus seizures?
"Could be a million things. There's no way to know unless we get him in for an MRI on his head or exploratory surgery so we can biopsy his bowels, which he won't let us do.",Wouldn't. Pain changes things.

He can Chase me out once he's done doubling up in agony.,"to Stewart WhatEver your big pRoblem is, it's caused a complication we call colon FOS."
I made my wishes clear.,"Uh-huh, and if the crazy fairy were here, she could grant them."
I'm not insane. I I feel pain when I go outside. So it it's rational to avoid that pain.,Except now you're feeling pain inside.
We can give him drugs for the blockage.,"And if it doesn't work? That blockage will rupture your intestines, spew sewage throughout your body. WhatEver you're scared of out there, aren't you more scared of death?"
"You obviously can't stand people. But for me, it's worse. All right? I'd rather die in here than live out there.","If you don't mind floppy hair and an annoying accent, I know a surgeon who will operate in your home."
"With the risk of infection, Chase won't actually",He's not gonna do surgery in some crazy dude's House.
You just said,"What I said was that Chase would put him under at the House, we'd take him to the hospital, open him up, do our thing, then slip him back into his room for the post-op without him Ever finding out that we tricked him."
Some of that was implied. It's unethical.,He'll be asleep.
He gets to make his own calls Even if he's asleep.,Why are you siding with him?
"Hey, why don't we operate on his infarcted leg while we're at it? Who cares if he said no.",I was risking my life to avoid becoming a cripple. He's doing it to avoid sunlight and fresh air.
to House Why aren't you arguing with her?,"Because she's right. I don't care where he gets the post-op, just that he gets it. Keep him here."
House. You okay?,Yes. We don't need to talk.
We don't need to talk. Your hand.,House looks down at his bandaged hand That's weird. I usually don't get the stigmata until Easter.

What's going on between you and Cuddy?,Bad lovin' gone bad.
Seriously. Why didn't you argue with her? She just threw us off the case.,Because ignoring her is a lot easier.
It's like the red badge of idiocy.,"If the confederacy had mosquitoes, we'd all have southern accents and I'd be paying Foreman less."
"She kicked you off the case. This is what happens when you don't address it. She acts weird, things get different.",You understand that different implies difference. She's tossed me a million times before.
"No, she always chastises you. And you'd always come running to me to complain. So you're acting different too. You're scared. You are scared to get involved.",How is that scary? It's rational. Emotionally mature people who work together should not date. Guaranteed breakup. Guaranteed ugliness.
"Any relationship that doesn't end in a breakup ends in death. Everything falls apart in the end. That's your worldview. The corollary, which you keep forgetting, is that you have to grab any chance for happiness.",Why does this matter so much to you? Cuddy and I are fine. The only person getting worked up here is you.
I don't want you to be fine. I want you to be happy. I think if you dated her,Are you familiar with the adverb vicariously?
If I wanted to ask her out,You did ask her out. Last year. WhatEver happened there?
I don't know. I wasn't interested.,Wrong.
"Wrong. You were interested. But Amber grabbed your genitals first. But now you're single, and that makes you miserable because you think it's too soon for another relationship. So you're gonna make me miserable. Please, get a girlfriend, or a life, or something. For me.",Better or worse?
Worse. Drugs aren't working. I think we should do the surgery in his House like we planned.,"Well, then one of us wasn't paying attention because I thought that surgery thing was just a trick."
We prepared the room. We hung the drapes. It's pRobably ten times as sterile as any mobile operating theater you'd find in a battlefield.,We still need Trapper John.
Chase doesn't want anywhere near this surgery. Maybe you could talk to him.,I can't understand a word he says.

Little bleeder here. Cautering.,"Hey, wait. The gas"
"Hey, wait. The gas",to the Lawyer That always happens during surgery.
We should run a blood test for celiac.,Not fast enough. Not accurate enough. He stops tossing the ball Force-feed him wheat then do an endoscopy as it hits his duodenum. See if there's an allergic reaction.
"So is the blood test, which is painless.","Foreman, listen to that little voice in your head that's coming from the telephone. speaking directly into his cell phone on the desk Force-feed him."
I'm guessing that's a new technique.,"Hey, you remember that idea that Cameron had about trying to torture the Patient into admitting himself?"
Pretty sure it was your idea. You want me to slow down the test?,"Wow. Everyone's got all these great ideas today. pause So you're thinking Patient won't leave because leaving causes pain, so we gotta make staying more painful. That actually makes sense."
"You'll increase his pain, but not enough to make a difference. He's on morphine.","He's on morphine now. Pretty soon he'll be on less-phine. 'Cause when you restock, you'll actually be giving Cameron IV bags of saline."
And why do you think I'll be doing this?,Same reason you did the surgery.
That was because it was an emergency.,No.

Have you considered that it's not my place you really want to be walking into right now?,"Rick Ocasek would kill me if I oh, you mean Cuddy."
"Yeah, she's a little nuts. But she's beautiful, smart, funny, and most important, she can stand you.","Yeah. I came here to have you lecture me on Cuddy, not because there's a killer mosquito chasing me around my apartment."
"House, there is no mosquito. This is all about Cuddy.","Ah, she's bugging me. Poetic."
Have you seen this bug?,pointing to his hand Have you seen this bite?
No. What I've seen is a suppurating wound that you've scratched and mutilated into a gangrenous state. Delusional parasitosis.,I am not imagining things.
"House, you're a drug addict. You're always imagining things. You got bitten the night you kissed her. Your itParkng always gets worse when you think about her. You need to address this.",She's my boss.
"No, you're not afraid of authority. You're afraid she actually is right for you. You're afraid to take a chance because it's too big a chance. If it doesn't work with her, then maybe there's no one out there.","I am not rationalizing. I'm better off alone. Also, you seen her ass recently?"
You're not staying here.,"Oh, come on."
"No. You can go home. He pushes House off the sofa Or you're going to Cuddy's, House gets up and moves toward the front door gonna ring her doorbell! And you're gonna ask her out on a date He pats House on the back like regular people do.",At 300 in the morning? When do regular people sleep?

Patient with PEA. Clear.,Wait!
"His heart's back to sinus rhythm, but it's bradycardic. Taub's putting in a temporary pacemaker. It'll keep his heart beating for now.","Hey, Cameron, how would you like your old job back? I'm asking 'cause it's the only way I can fire you."
Could be lymphoma.,We'd have seen it on the abdomen. It has to be a poison.
"Unless he's eating a bouquet a day, he couldn't",How clean?
Very. He pRobably has a little OCD.,to Stewart How often do you wash your tub?
Every couple days.,Bleach and ammonia?
Bleach and ammonia? Yeah.,You know how kids play toy soldiers in the bath? He likes to re-enact the battle of Ypres three times a week with real gas.
Highly fat soluble. He lost weight after the stomach pain. Explains why his symptoms kept getting worse.,Put him on parenteral steroids and sodium bicarbonate.
"Even if you're right, that external pacemaker's gonna fail Eventually. And I don't have the skills to put in a perManent one.","Well, maybe the poison hasn't completely shot his heart. And you won't have to feel guilty for the rest of your life."
calling from Stewart's House I just tried your House. Where are you?,Clubbing. Good or bad?
Bad. Vitals are dropping. The abdominal pain keeps getting worse.,Means we were too late with the treatment. Tell the Lawyer he's off the clock. We're done.
You're giving up?,Call Taub. Tell him to pick up some morphine. He sits up There's no need for the Patient to be in pain.
He's on morphine.,No. He's on saline.
I figured you put him on saline so I switched him back to morphine.,"I love you. When you reach puberty, give me House has his epiphany His abdominal pain. That was on morphine?"
Yes. Is there something that causes abdominal pain that doesn't respond to morphine?,I was right. He is being poisoned.
I was right. He is being poisoned.,What's this density on his hip?
looking at the scan Just bone.,Think less boney.
You think he's got lead poisoning?,"Explains the constipation, the nerves, the seizures. Hold him down."
"Explains the constipation, the nerves, the seizures. Hold him down.",to Stewart You're not gonna feel a thing! Except excruciating pain.
to Stewart You're not gonna feel a thing! Except excruciating pain.,The mugger used hollow points.
"I'll start him on chelation. The agoraphobia, could it",No. Lead wouldn't have started to disintegrate till years after.
I know you think that. But your life could be better. You you you'd have choices.,He's lying.
He's lying. About what?,About Everything. About his life. He doesn't Even think he's happy here. He's miserable.
I've got Everything I need.,Yeah?
"Yeah? Well, then why did Taub find rose petals in your entry hallway? Struck me as a little weird. Thought it might be medically relevant. But it actually just told me that you were pathetic. The day you crashed in your entryway! Was your girlfriend's birthday. He picks up a framed photograph You weren't there for the mail. You were trying to go lay flowers on her grave. House holds up the photo, which is obviously a picture of Stewart and his girlfriend","Yeah, he's got PTSD."
yelling Get an ambulance. Good morning.,Don't wanna hear it.
So I take it you did not ask Cuddy out.,Yeah. He stops and pulls his Vicodin bottle from his pocket
Yeah I didn't or yeah I did?,WhichEver one means you almost had me convinced it was a good idea.
"Oh. He lets go of the elevator door, which starts to close. House prEvents it from closing with his cane",Nothing to say?
Nothing to say? No.,"No, you don't. Or no, you don't don't?"
WhichEver one means no.,Is this some kind of rEverse ?
She's a factory worker. Means she pRobably works close to a lot of recent immigrants.,Thank God some of those offshore sweat shop jobs are coming back to America. He hangs his coat on the coatrack
She's an eMancipated minor.,"In a factory? Either an Olympic gymnast who busted her leg, a Parkld star who blew all her sequel money on drugs, or she's just a lying runaway."
"The girl's holding down a job, makes her rent.","preparing his coffee On the one hand, Kutner's right."
16 doesn't automatically mean a risky lifestyle.,Didn't we just have this conversation?
Kutner can do the echo on his own.,Yes! But he'll be very lonely. So I have to ask why?
I've been asked to help run a clinical trial. That okay with you?,Good for your career. Great for your street cred. What's in it for me?
You have four doctors and nEver more than one case. It means I have time to work on other things. And they'll have more chances to step up. Stand on their own.,"And if there's an emergency with Annie, should she wait until you finish grooming lab rats?"
"If there's a pRoblem with Sophia or any other Patient, you know I'll be there. The Patient is my priority.","definitively and dismissisvely No. Foreman does not move Oh, do you want a reason? Clinical trials take time. Your time is my time. Foreman walks out"
Even if she is Irrelevant. Echo showed no heart damage.,Would that be the echo that Foreman chose not to run with you after I dashed his new drug discovery dreams?
I didn't screw up the echo.,I know. No structural heart damage.
So if it's not the heart!,It's the heart.
Didn't you just say it's not?,Not all heart damage has to be structural. Drugs could have caused intermittent tachycardia. He gets up
She builds her own furniture. You think she skips work because she's feeling a little weak? She needs steroids.,"Steroids could cause an irregular heartbeat, making her current one irregular-er-er."
We started her on haloperidol. She's stable. Lab tests showed the delirium wasn't caused by a metabolic pRoblem. Means we still don't know what caused it.,"popping the Vicodin Yeah, we do. Nice job, Foreman."
I didn't switch her meds.,But your decision to stick it to the Man clearly inspired Oliver Twist. He picks up a water bottle from the table and takes a drink
I treated her based on the symptoms she presented.,"You treated her based on empathetic orphan syndrome, and almost killed her in the process."
"And arrhythmia. The psychotic break caused a surge of adrenaline, but no irregular heartbeat. Heart's not the pRoblem. We're both wrong.",So what causes lung issues and delirium? And is not based on wishful thinking that she's safe and happy?
And is not based on wishful thinking that she's safe and happy? Prinzmetal angina.,Silent and unhappy is better than vocal and unhelpful.
No reason it couldn't cause an artery in the brain to spasm. Leads to the delirium and the pulmonary edema.,"Foreman, give her ergonovine to cause vasospasms, and run an fMRI to see which artery's dancing."
"No signs of spasm, impeded blood flow, or brain dysfunction. It's not Prinzmetal's. All the fMRI showed is House was right. She was lying.",Only relevant if it can cause pulmonary edema and delirium.
"We find out our Patient's been raped, and that's your response?",Is she a psych Patient?
Rape could mean STD.,Thank goodness one of you doesn't have a heart.
No sign in her bloodwork. Could be lying about the rape.,"leaning forward in his chair and placing his cane across his lap Yesterday, you were all BFF. Now you think she's pathological."
She lied about dead parents because it's better than rapist parents. You find that unsympathetic?,That's it.
That's it. What's it?,Her whole life's a mess. What rhymes with mess?
"It's not stress. She has none of the usual Manifestations. No hormone imbalance, no cardiac","Yeah, she's drowning in her own lungs, and she's delirious."
"Even if House is wrong, the treatment's basically anti-anxiety meds. Hard to argue with.","Yes. I agree. It does explain Everything. Thirteen, load her up on diazepam. Foreman, make sure she does it. House gets up Thirteen, make sure he makes sure."
"Yes. I agree. It does explain Everything. Thirteen, load her up on diazepam. Foreman, make sure she does it. House gets up Thirteen, make sure he makes sure.",I went to Cuddy's House. But I didn't go in. Went home without ringing either her metaphorical or actual bell.
Went home without ringing either her metaphorical or actual bell. Huh.,You're processing.
You're processing. I'm scrubbing.,Huh means processing.
"Huh means acknowledging. If you prefer, I could say ha, or hmm, or",No insights? No opinions? Wilson does not respond You're disappointed.
You made the decision. I can't tell you what's right for you.,Seriously? 'Cause last week you could. Last year you could. Seems to come pretty easy to you.
Do you want me to tell you what you should do?,I want you to stop thinking that acting inscrutable makes you anything other than annoying.
I want you to stop thinking that acting inscrutable makes you anything other than annoying. Interesting.,Calling loudly as Wilson leaves Holding things in can give you cancer!
Labs show the brown urine was caused by shredded red cells.,"standing, his cane across his shoulders, his back to the team So what messes with her lungs, her mental status, and runs her blood through a wood Parkpper?"
"No, her sodium's normal.","What does her furniture look like? He turns to face the team Said it was homemade. Old boxes, what?"
It was wood nailed together.,The wood have little dents or holes?
The desk did. Looked like she had stapled stuff all over it.,"Holes means that it was pressure-treated. Sawing or burning it releases arsenic into the air, into her lungs."
Tests didn't show,Because it found a cloak of invisibility hiding
"Magical lesions, which appear out of nowhere.","She was cured, then she wasn't."
WBC count would be through the roof.,Put the arsenic back.
You wanna treat a Patient nearly poisoned to death by giving her more poison?,Just because we call something a poison doesn't mean it's bad for you.
It was killing her.,"But since she's still dying, the arsenic obviously wasn't killing her."
APL explains the lesions and why they appeared after we took the arsenic out.,"So, put the arsenic back. He pops a Vicodin"
Best match would be a sibling or a parent.,"Biopsy a lesion, confirm that she's dying, then load her up with arsenic."

This about the case you didn't want me to know about? Cuddy?,Foreman.

This boy is going to die. You selfish enough to let it happen?,Pot calling a kettle a pot?

Wanted something all your own? Now you got it.,Your disengagement won't work.
I can see that.,"You think that when you tell me what I should do, my instincts are to push back, so that by not telling me what you think I should do, I'll"
I sound convoluted.,Disengagement is neither artful nor effective.
So my not doing anything isn't causing you to do anything?,Right.
I'm okay with that.,"No, you're not. You are designed to have opinions and to force them on people."
"It's her life. Point wasn't I'm dying. Point was she should live. You should have told her. Instead you tell her to call the cops, give her stats on DNA markers. Everything's by the book. Nothing's Ever personal.",interrupting loudly from his office Trying to sleep here!
Biopsy confirmed APL. She needs a bone marrow transplant.,picking up his backpack Run the donor banks. I'm going home. He slings the backpack over his shoulder
We need to track down her parents.,"approaParkng the doorway I assume she's already said no to that idea, or there'd be no need to screw up your courage before saying it."
Parkldren who've been through trauma can't think clearly. Parkldren who've been through trauma and are dying,Guess I'm the only one who cares about Patient rights.
What she wants could kill her. What she needs could save her.,"Our job is to find out what's killing Patients, not treat them for chronic idiocy. He turns back to his office"
Idiocy is what's killing her.,"picking his coat up off the chair And since we can't cure that, I'm going home. He moves toward his office door"
"We could save this Patient, but all you care about is getting your answer.",turning back and looking at Thirteen Your point being?
Donor list turned up a partial match.,So treat her.
It's only a three out of six.,So don't treat her.
She may not last the week. Partial's better than nothing.,So treat her.
She'll reject it. And she'll be too weak to try again when a better match turns up.,"It's my turn now, right?"
If a better match turns up.,"Well, when you decide, get back to me."
"Well, when you decide, get back to me. She's scared.",Not scared enough. Tell her the thing about emotional reactions is they're definitionally irrational. Or stupid. Might wanna phrase that in your own words.
She wants to deny her parents the satisfaction of saving her life.,That's your rational explanation of her emotional response.
That was her explanation.,That makes sense. How long did it take her to come up with that?
It was her immediate reaction.,That doesn't make sense.
The fact that it makes sense doesn't make sense?,Emotional is immediate. She went to rational first. Means there was no emotional to process.
You're saying she's lying about being raped?,Wouldn't be her first.
She lied about one trauma to cover a worse trauma.,So! what's worse than rape?
So! what's worse than rape?,"Hi, I'm Dr. House. He stands to face her at the bottom of her bed What did you do?"
He stands to face her at the bottom of her bed What did you do? I don't,"Something happened, but it wasn't rape."
BeliEve whatEver you want.,"You're scared, and stubborn, and you don't like people feeling sorry for you. Why not?"
I don't want pity. I just wanna be normal.,But you know you're not.
"But you know you're not. He moves to the side of the bed until he is standing right over her You need people to see how independent you are, how well you're coping. So they won't see the lost, hurt little girl. He leans down and is now right in her face Because that's not what you see. You see someone who did something terrible! Who deserves to suffer. Who doesn't deserve to live. pause What did you do?","Eventually, we'll find your parents! If only to deliver the body."
Then they won't care.,"frustrated You're an idiot. You'd rather die than face your parents because, what, you broke their Faberge egg?"
"I killed their son. House looks stunned I killed my brother. pause I was supposed to watch him. pause He was in the bath. pause I could hear him laughing. pause Every time they look at me, it's like I kill him again.","quietly now If you don't take your parents' bone marrow! You'll be killing their other Parkld. If they don't hate you now, they will then."
I don't care.,Sure you do.
"Sure you do. You want someone to tell you it was just an accident. That it's not that bad, well, it is that bad. And you know it. There's nothing you can do to change that. pause But there is one thing you can do, to not make it worse.","If you're here to celebrate the kid's bone marrow transplant working, you missed cake."
I want to do clinical trials.,Already had this conversation.
I've proved that I can work two cases at once. I can do this. And I'm doing it.,Okay.
Okay? Just like that?,Can I give my reasons later! or nEver?
Three days ago you said no.,Three days ago you asked me. Now you told me. He grabs his backpack and cane and heads toward the office door Can't say no if it's not a question.
Nice thing you did for Foreman.,He speaks.
He speaks. He deflects.,I almost cost a four-year-old his life.
"Well, you knew Foreman would figure it out.",Did I? He looks at Wilson
"You just needed to prove it to him. You're an ass. But, a noble one.",I sound clEver.
I sound clEver. Thank you.,"Your little game didn't work. I'm not Foreman, and you're not me."
You wanna talk about her?,Nope.
"You're gonna be okay, House.",Good to know.
"Excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Cuddy.","Well, she's either not here, or she's under the desk. Either way, you're gonna have to wait outside until I'm finished."
Do you know when she'll be back?,"Yes, which is why I need you to get out and leave me alone. He grabs a pack of Post-Its from the desktop."
Sorry. He closes the office door behind him.,Nice try. Love to help.
Shut up! He closes the office door behind him.,calmly You wanted to see doctor
"I said shut up. I'm sick, and I want to know why. I want the best doctor in this hospital here, now! Or I'm gonna start killing people.",conversationally What seems to be the pRoblem?
"Okay, okay. to Oliver Just move it. As he and Oliver move the table You know, you don't have to point the gun, Man. We're gonna do whatEver you want.","not moving and not looking away from the gun No, we're not."

"What's missing is an answer! I can't breathe! I'm tired! all the time. I get skin rashes, and heart palpitations, and insomnia.","That's a cool constellation of symptoms. It could be something minor. At least compared to life in prison, which is what you seem to prefer to seeing 16 more specialists."
You barely looked at the file.,No need.
"Excuse me, my wife feels sick to her stomach.","Next time pack some heat, and maybe we'll look into it."
quietly I'll be okay.,"If you ask me, keeping an open line of communication is the best way to resolve conflict."
"Shortness of breath. And sharp pain when when I inhale. He sits, keeping his hand on the receiver.","So you figured your wife left you because you couldn't breathe, right?"
I've nEver been married.,Oh. Got a match?
Got a match? Why?,Because I'd rather not stand here while you try and negotiate a hostage trade for an incentive spirometer.
I'll look in Cuddy's desk.,Stay out of the desk! Cuddy doesn't smoke. But he does. gestures toward Mitch
"No, I I don't.",Right. You just brush your teeth with coffee grounds.

What does that mean?,It means we have a favorite. It's nerve related.
Amped-up hearing could be linked to nerve palsy.,Puff out your cheeks. Come on. House demonstrates and Jason imitates him. Now big mug shot smile.
Left side facial weakness.,SEventh nerve palsy. Plus intermittent rashes. Plus migraines. It's post-herpetic neuralgia.
Herpetic? You think I have herpes?,I'm not judging here. This thing is just as likely to be caused by Parkcken pox.

Of course you do!,"It's gotta be a Pancoast tumor. Patient's got dyspnea, sEventh-nerve palsy. He's sweating on one side of his face."
Everything okay in there?,Take your time. It's not like I've got a gun to my head.
Lung cancer usually shows up lower than the sEventh nerve. Did you check his throat?,to Jason Spit on the floor.
to Jason Spit on the floor. What?,"If I do it, I can't tell Cuddy that it was medically necessary."
"If there's swelling, it's a Pancoast tumor that's metastasized.",Feel that. Right there.
"feeling it If it's cancer, there must be a test.",You just did it.
What about an X-ray or something?,"Good idea. Oh, damn. I left my CT maParkne in my other pants."
How Many hostages do you think it would cost me for a trip to radiology?,So! what made you snap? HMOs?
HMOs? Shut up.,"Nah, you saw 16 doctors. How bad could they have been?"
How bad could they have been? Shut up!,Humiliation?
Move around. He lies down with his head in the headrest. Anyone moves! I fire.,That's not all. Curiosity's not enough. There's gotta be a deeper reason.
You nEver did anything just because you had to know?,NEver shot anyone.
"You're not me. This is my body. This is my life. And there's a truth out there. I'd rather rot in jail knowing than! I can't handle not knowing. The gun, which is facing Regina, quivers.",Yeah.
"The gun, which is facing Regina, quivers. Yeah.",What's this?
Starburst artifact. The metal from the gun is ruining the image.,to Oliver Show him.
turning the pad around Starburst.,"Now, unless you think we pre-arranged that, just in case we were Ever held hostage by a guy who needs a CT, we're not lying."
House got him to give up his gun. We just ran.,looking back at Oliver Why are you still here?
They're gonna be through that door any moment. Just show me the tumor.,There isn't one. I don't know what you have.
You had four theories. You ruled out four theories. Maybe no one can cure me.,He overpowered me and got the gun back. He hangs up.
"to House You're a coward. You need to know Everything because you're afraid to be wrong. You're so afraid of being ordinary, of being just another doctor, just another huMan being, that you'll risk other people's lives.",I'm arrogant. You're the coward. You're terrified of death. You just want to cheat it by making it come sooner. Gives you the illusion of control.
standing in the corner behind Thirteen Can I go?,Sorry. We might need you. The phone starts ringing again. House picks it up and slams down the receiver. How do they expect me to think?
Are you insane?,"He's quick for a sick guy. Dyspnea, anemia, sEventh-nerve palsy, tachycardia. He puts his cell phone on speaker and drops it on the counter. Long passes. Anything. Go."
Loa loa filariasis.,You Ever been to Cameroon or on the Ogowe River? Next.
getting up and approaParkng the desk Histiocytosis X explains the lung involvement and,"getting up and approaParkng Jason Whoa, whoa, whoa! We have a new symptom. He is turning his head, favoring his left ear. Means he's partially deaf in the right."
I'm doing this by choice. It's not a symptom.,We'll keep that between us till you talk to your Lawyer.
"House, you can't","If you have Cushing's, this will slow your breathing."
Give it to her first.,Those were not the terms.
pointing the gun I lied. These drugs could be fake.,Why would I do that? I gave you back the gun!
You wouldn't. They would.,"She has Huntington's. If these drugs are real, it could screw up her liver."
"grabbing the syringe and injecting herself in the hip The chances are slim. Chances of him shooting one of us, on the other hand",Don't do
"Eight, ten years.",Killing her is your chance to get personal?
So if we get out of here,"If she were clinging to hope, she wouldn't be standing in line waiting for you to order up more drugs."
Not knowing what was wrong with me! made me miserable. Maybe that's insane. Doing this! Yeah. Insane. But I had something to gain. You can't take risks with no upside at all.,"removing the stethoscope I can't decide which is riskier, taking crazy risks or taking advice on crazy risks from a crazed risk-taker."
Does that mean she!,Means I was wrong. Her kidneys are shutting down because of the meds you made her take.
Means I was wrong. Her kidneys are shutting down because of the meds you made her take.,"We have to get her out of here. He opens his cell phone. The dexamethasone is making Thirteen's kidneys fail, but not the Patient's why?"
"This guy's been on 50 different medications. Maybe his kidneys should be failing, but something's protecting them.",to Jason I need to slap you.
He's been on protein pump inhibitors for years for his stomach pain.,Those drugs have been protecting his kidneys for years.
"Something that explains breathing pRoblems, heart pRoblems, jumpy nerves, and weak blood. LeishManiasis.",Would make perfect sense if our Patient was an Arabian Bedouin.
"Melioidosis. Bacteria gets into the lungs, spreads to the heart. It explains Everything.","Except that if you read the history, you'd know that our Patient has nEver been to a tropical climate!"
I've nEver been anywhere south of Florida.,You idiot.
You idiot. Florida counts?,"Well, not to the Supreme Court."
You keep blaming doctors when you can't Even give a halfway decent history. Negotiation's over.,It will be as soon as you get us three grams of ceftazidime.
You can have Dr. House.,disconnecting the call Why are you getting rid of me?
I need to trade you for the answer.,You're gonna give her the meds.
You're gonna give her the meds. No!,"Come on, give 'em to me instead."
apologetically She's taken Everything I've taken. The combination of meds could knock me out.,"angrilyHer kidneys are failing. You give her those drugs, she'll be dead by the time they get the cuffs on you."
I need my answer.,Your obsession is gonna kill her!
Your obsession gave me back the gun! He points the gun at House.,"calmer now It is pointless to give her those drugs. Even if they are screwing with you, this is your last diagnosis."
"pushing herself to a semi-sitting position House, get out of here.",Shut up. I'm not leaving.
I don't want to die! I don't want to die!,Why are you still alive?
About that Huntington's drug trial! She smiles at him.,Test confirmed melioidosis. Easy to miss on a stain. He retriEves his cane. Scans and X-rays vary widely.
"Is that all you care about? A moron storms the clinic, bullies his way into life without parole, you enabling him Every step.","If he hadn't done what he did, he'd be dead. Good thing you enabled my Every medical move. He moves to stand closer to her."
You think I handled this differently because you were in here?,I don't know. Let's try it again without me.
This is why you and I can't be a! thing.,"If you're suggesting that you screwed up because of a non-relationship with me, I don't know how I can help you."
You want a relationship?,"God, no. Just trying to follow your logic."
Any idea why we're getting half as Many requests for you as usual?,Democrats' health care plan?
At least we have one case that looks intriguing. 30-year-old fitness trainer suddenly can't breathe. Collapses and breaks her ankle. He grabs the file and starts reading. That's it? You're not gonna argue why this case is beneath you?,No point. I'm in an elevator. Can't run away.
You can't run away anyway.,That's just mean. They get off the elevator and walk down the hall side by side. Why are we still together?
We are going to our office.,Pronoun confusion. Starts kicking in once you pass Parkld-bearing age.
"Well, that's just mean. My office was recently destroyed. I thought I'd use the office of the doctor directly responsible. She blocks the door to House's office with her arm.",I think the Patient holding the gun to my head was actually the one directly responsible.
My desk won't fit in his cell. You can use our outer office.,Where's Foreman and Thirteen?
What's Cuddy doing in your office?,Other than throwing off the feng shui with her ass that faces all eight sides of the bagua at once?
calling from House's office These walls aren't soundproof.,I'm well aware. to Kutner and Taub Normal CT means that her lung pRoblem has the distinction of having nothing to do with her lungs.
"looking at a photo from the file Steroids. No one looks this fit without cheating. Anabolic steroids hack away at the immune system, left her open to a pulmonary infection.",looking at the picture Wow. Muscles and curves. My penis is so confused.
She has infomercials to sell her DVDs. What? I'm up late a lot.,And you actually beliEve what you see on TV. Go run the labs.
loudly The labs are back. And there's no sign of steroid use. Can someone please read her file?,Can someone please stop backseat differentialating?
"joining them Perfect, except that she was jogging half a mile from the nearest road. In the cold. Cold air hits the lungs, sets off an attack. Exercise-induced asthma.","Nice try. Except EIA doesn't account for the elevated BP, if you'd read the file. to Taub and Kutner Come on. Before the shrieking harpy melts my brain."
Her BP's fine.,I know.
Exercise-induced asthma actually fits.,I know. You know. She can't know.
The only good way to test for EIA is to recreate the conditions in which the attack occurred. But we can't exactly make her run out in the cold on a broken ankle.,"Get creative. He fakes giving Taub Emmy's photo. When he reaches for it, House gives it to Kutner."
Shut up. Stop. You can stop feeling guilty. Your best tapping rate was .004 taps per millisecond. Means your nerves have started degenerating.,"You wanna work in here? Fine. Me too. We'll split the desk, 50-50. That side's yours. This side's mine."
You're right. There's plenty of space here. Neither one of us needs all of it.,So that's your strategy. Taking the high road. It's not gonna work.
We shocked her back to sinus rhythm. She's stable. Test didn't set it off. Her EKG was normal.,"Well, she's consistent. The lung pRoblems had nothing to do with her lungs. A heart pRoblem that has nothing to do with her heart. Something is strangling her system."
Something is strangling her system. Carcinoid tumor?,"Find it, cut it out."
"Because our Patient's a big, fat cheater.",Subtle. No way you geniuses could've spotted this.
into the phone Hold on a second. She puts her hand over the mouthpiece and turns to House. Can you do this outside?,"I could, but that would defeat the purpose of doing it here. Where are the smart guys?"
"If you mean Foreman and Thirteen, apparently the first appointment of the drug trial's an all-day thing.",I said yes to this?
Her gastric bypass procedure could cause,Forget the bypass. Treat her like a fat girl.
Should we treat her like a 60-year-old Asian Man too? She's not fat.,"Not on the outside. But on the inside, she's still tons of fun."
"When she was obese, she pRobably had type two diabetes. Could've left her with perManent nerve damage.",Ten points for doing what I said.
Can you hold on a second? She puts the phone against her shoulder and turns to listen to House.,My balls. Have you seen my balls? Giant one and the red one.
Your plan isn't gonna work.,Of course it is.
searParkng in her purse You're not bothering me.,Step one complete.
Sleep apnea explains,Apnea would've disappeared when she shrank.
Apnea cuts off oxygen to the brain. The resulting neurological damage,She been snoring?
She didn't mention it.,Did she mention feeling tired after a full night's sleep?
"Did she mention feeling tired after a full night's sleep? No, but",staring at the photo This isn't apnea. And this is a stupid room to be doing a DDX in.
staring at the photo This isn't apnea. And this is a stupid room to be doing a DDX in.,"Cliff notes. Gastric bypass only makes her skinny on the outside. On the inside, we have heart and lung issues not caused by heart and lung issues."
Forget the bypass.,Let the dying girl finish.
You said forget the,Tssss. Dr. Thirteen has the floor.
Bypass could create malabsorption issues. Leads to low potassium.,Very stupid. Her potassium's fine.
But her intestines aren't. Gastric bypass could cause malabsorption by creating a blind loop of bowel. It ulcerates during exercise. Bacteria get loose in the bloodstream. Migrate to the heart and lungs.,Very not stupid. Bacteria in the bowels means there's bacteria in the poop. Get some and test it.
He could've come up with SIBO anywhere else in the hospital. You didn't need to come down here and screw with us.,But her wrong idea led to his right one. It was vital screwing.
It is. You just can't appreciate it because it's gonna destroy your career.,"standing behind them, unnoticed What happened? He call Foreman clean and articulate again? It is surprising."
Clinic Patients just whining.,What's the poop?
It's gonna take about an hour to spin down the sample.,What are we looking for?
You don't know?,I'm doing my famous Socrates impression. Think I really nailed the accent.
High fat content indiCates SIBO.,And what does fat do in water? He's at the sink with the tap turned on.
He's at the sink with the tap turned on. It floats.,What else floats in water?
What else floats in water?,Looks like I was wrong to dismiss apnea. You guys can stay up all night gloating in the sleep lab. He drops the glove on the bucket and leaves.
Numbness in her left foot is ascending into her leg.,How did she Manage to sneak out for a run?
She said she needed to use the bathroom.,"You two get the results of the sleep apnea test, or did those need to use the bathroom too?"
I was mixing some hydrogen sulfide for good and valid reasons and must've spilled some on my side. Did it waft over to your side?,Cunning plan. You do realize it's gonna stink for hours on both sides.
Or her brain.,Or both.
"Appreciate the life lesson, but 15 minutes give or take isn't gonna make a difference. Get started on your other Patients. I'll be down there when we're done here.","Way to know where your bread is buttered, sister. raising his hand for a high five Up high!"
"But if it's her nerves, it could be transverse myelitis.",Or a million other things.
She has muscle weakness. Could indiCate myasthenia gravis.,I had the weirdest dream.
Maybe you should just let her have your office.,Or!
I don't think sabotaging your boss' office is a wise counterattack.,All that is needed for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing. He hands Taub his cane and picks up a sledge hammer.
She pRobably used a lot of botox to tighten up her skin.,True.
I don't think replacing that was part of the renovation plans.,"It is now. Lucky for us, we can treat all those toxins with the same thing chelation."
The chelation didn't work. Her muscles are still deteriorating.,That rules out toxins. So what else can go wrong when the Hindenburg deflates?
Why aren't we doing this in your office?,Obviously because it would be stupid to do this in an office with no furniture. Cuddy! overreacted to my overreaction.
Coronaro-cardiac fistula. Even a small hole could cause,"This started in the lungs, not the heart. And why are you leaning on a 45-degree angle away from Foreman?"
sitting up I'm sitting straight.,Trouble in the land of false hope?
Everything is fine. Austrian syndrome.,Nice deflection.
His beeper goes off. He puts it on vibrate. Guillain-Barr. Usually starts as a muscle pain Patients compare to the pain of over-exercising.,So who's paging you? Your wife? Does it worry you that she paged Kutner first?
Guillain-Barr fits. Patient didn't notice the initial symptoms because it's no different than how she feels Every day. Her muscle weakness is the precursor to full paralysis.,"Gastric bypass pRobably set it off. Oh, at what price beauty? Go start her on plasmapheresis."
You going over the fence?,"Took three visits, but I finally convinced the contractor that I'm Cuddy's boss. And all the office renovation plans need to go through me."
"You did do the math on this, right? Screwing with her office means her renovations will take longer. Means she will be in your office longer.",marking an area on the blueprint See there?
She'll be with you where you claim to not want her.,I smashed it with a sledgehammer.
I think in some ancient cultures that was actually considered a proposal of marriage.,Is this fun for you? Analyzing Everyone else's fun away?
"Which means whatEver it is, it's now in her brain. She gets up to leave.",Where are you going?
Where are you going? Sorry. Treatment.,Does Foreman schedule your appointments by numbers on the clock or just by when I'm in the middle of something?
Sorry if I'm dying at a bad time for you. Could be CNS lymphoma. She leaves.,calling after her So losing the 200 pounds was just a coincidence? He gets up.
What about a prion disease?,"If her brain is slowly turning into a Swiss cheese, there's not a lot we can do."
There are some possible treatments.,Get a brain biopsy to confirm.
You're not cutting into this Woman's brain before you test.,That is the test.
"Not for CNS lymphoma, which is a perfectly legitimate diagnosis. One you can test for non-invasively.",You're obviously not opposed to being invasive.
"Rule out CNS lymphoma first. Then rule out astrocytoma, then rule out other brain tumors!",I hereby declare them ruled out.
"Run the tests. You can do a brain biopsy, but only as a last resort. She returns to his office.",following her Start running down Cuddy's list of diseases it's not. Taub and Kutner get up.
following her Start running down Cuddy's list of diseases it's not. Taub and Kutner get up.,You're not stopping me for medical reasons. You're stopping me! because you have the hots for me.
You're still here because you have the hots for me.,Evidenced by the fact that I'm the one who moved into your office.
It's the biggest office. And I'm not the one that destroyed,Why are you dressed like that? Why do you try so hard to get my attention? Are you screwing with me?
Are you screwing with me?,That depends on your answer.
Everybody knows this is going somewhere. pause I think we're supposed to kiss now.,We already did that. He puts his hand on her breast. It seemed like the logical next step.
Really? I'm an idiot for being surprised.,Can you leave these?
"entering Uh, where's Cuddy? It's not CNS lymphoma.",I know.
She's getting worse. You want me to find Cuddy and get her approval for the brain biopsy?,"When you were philandering with impunity, how did that feel?"
"Superficially, I loved it. But deep down, I think I was miserable. Why? What's going on?",You weren't miserable. You gave something away to make a relationship work. You rationalize that you're getting something back.
"Okay, I'm gonna go get Cuddy's approval for the brain biopsy.",Leave 'em there. I'm gonna do the biopsy myself. He leaves.
Cuddy wanted us to eliminate sEven different things.,Cuddy doesn't always get what she wants.
Bad idea to get into a power play with somebody who has the power.,You're fired. Just reinforcing your point.
"WhatEver personal drama you're playing out, you'd be a lot smarter to",Thought you said she was sick.
Thought you said she was sick.,Sick people don't spontaneously get better.
"Yes, they do. It's called an immune system.","Sick people who are sick enough to make it to me don't spontaneously get better. Not as pithy, but yeah, technically more accurate. What's the last thing you gave her?"
I took her for an MRI looking for,MRIs detect. They don't treat. What did you give her after the MRI?
"I didn't give her anything. She got depressed at the lack of direction. We went to the cafeteria for some chocolate cake. Took her to her room, hung a banana bag, let her rest.",You gave her cake.
She asked for it. I figured,You figured you'd let me play 20 questions instead of just telling me. He leaves. Taub follows.
You figured you'd let me play 20 questions instead of just telling me. He leaves. Taub follows.,Feeling crappy again?
Is this a joke?,It's not a joke.
"We just have to rEverse your gastric bypass and get you back on a high carb, glucose-enriched diet.",The best you you could be is a lot more you. He brings another forkful of cake to her. Open the hangar. Here comes the plane.
You don't want to have the surgery?,Understand.
House is gonna kill us.,"Slowly. They turn. He's standing behind them. And painfully. You're not only idiots, you're frauds. Fraudulent idiots. Fraudulent idiotic killers, as it turns out."
"House, this was really my",Your fault?
She was dead.,She wasn't dead.
Did you see their faces?,I think we may have an anal hygiene violation there.
So the CT.,"That was from a Patient three years ago. It was hard to find. But the hair and make-up, getting Chase and Cameron to play along, much easier."
We deserved it. I'll take down the website before,Take it down?
And you still got 3 hours left.,Do I?
16-year-old female gets pranked and also gets visual hallucinations and vomiting. Turns out to be a failing liver.,Why have Foreman's breasts suddenly started to droop?
Large breasts are a classic symptom of you letting Foreman take vacation days so he can finish his FDA reports before the end of the year.,When are you taking vacation? He raises his eyebrows suggestively.
Hepatic and neurological involvement,"So I understand Foreman's absence. Your presence, not so much."
I'm bringing in a case. You may have noticed me doing that before.,"I've noticed you a lot recently. It's almost as if you have a sexual interest in someone here. Like, say! Taub."
"grabs the card Greg, made me think of you.",That's funny. Usually explodes after I do that.
You throwing that away?,Twice. He grabs it and puts it back in the trash Someone's screwing with me. Forget it.
"Handwriting's kinda girly. You got an admirer, House?","I said, forget the book! The fellows look at each other Why'd they pick on her?"
She's an overaParkEver. High grades. She volunteers. She's a big target.,I'm assuming literally. Depending on where this school falls on the Healthers scale!
Do you think the kids slipped her something? Their teachers grilled them.,When do teachers nEver know how to motivate their students?
"Well, scratch the hallucinations. That's from the mushrooms. That leaves liver failure and now pulmonary edema.","And you, standing there, beseeParkngly."
Thirteen and Foreman were busy drug trialing and we needed an answer on the overdose so we called her in. She's just updating us.,to Cuddy Convenient.
"This is a good experience for me, as my parents nEver got divorced.",Theories!
House. We all know what's going on here. Cuddy gave you that present.,No. Infections?
"standing I think! loud, long sigh I think she loves you.",angrily I told you to lay off the present. The fellows smile behind his back. and the LSD. We got distracted by the painkillers. Toxins are still the most likely.
"Just tell her how you feel. If you won't, then I will. I'll walk right down there. Damn it. Love like this needs to fly free.",You talked to Wilson.
"He has very girly handwriting, by the way.",I knew I should have just wrapped a new present. You said the Patient volunteered. Where?
"checking file Uh, Pleasant Valley.",Soup kitchen in Trenton.
"Soup kitchen in Trenton. Thirteen, Kutner go search the home and the school. Taub, you take the anal swabbing of the fragrant and contagious homeless men. Taub stops smiling as the fellows leave.",Why don't you just hang out in the video store and tell Everyone Kevin Spacey's Keyser Soze?
You had my present for a year and didn't Even open it?,I had no way of knowing there was an expensive book inside.
"Completely meaningless prank, Even for you. He gets another ice cream sandwich","Stealing your ice cream is a completely meaningless, albeit delicious prank. Observing my team's reactions to unexplained phenomena could've been pretty useful."

"Yes. House pauses while eating the ice cream to stare at Wilson. The holidays. They're hard for you. I get it. They sit at a table You see the people around you giving and receiving gifts, having sustained, meaningful relationships. And, since you can't, something deep in your subconscious makes you create the appearance of a gift. It's sad.",You really passed your psych rotation?
It's too bad you can't just be nice to people. You could get a real present that way.,"If I wanted gifts, I would just look deep into my Patient's eyes and act like you."
You just wind up insulting her. Perhaps calling her Mrs. Moron.,"Right, because I'm physically incapable of being polite."
"Being kind in a sustained, meaningful way? No.","Oh, I get it."
"Yeah. That actually is what I'm trying to do. And the pathetic part is, it's not going to work.",thoughtfully You're right. I gotta stop being such a jerk. Wilson looks at him. He takes Wilson's second ice cream sandwich. Oops. Kinda undercut myself there. He leaves
House. It's tuberculosis.,"You got that from an anal swab? Man, you're good."

I have a! a terrible headache.,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I'll get you fixed up. Is there anything else you need like a bottle of water? Coffee? Mint tea?"
"No, but that's so nice. Usually the clinic doctors are kinda rushed.","If you can't be nice, why be a doctor. So, where do you feel the pain?"
In the back of my head here.,"Uh, huh. It's Beccaria's sign. That'll be gone by your third trimester."
"Uh, I'm not in school.",deep breath Neither is your fetus.

How do you! You know that just from the headache?,"How do I know? I missed my period. I got fat, threw up. Oh no, wait. That's how you know."

How did you check it five times? The cycler's broken. You would have had to send it out. It would have taken,"Oh, yeah."
He opens Wilson's door. What? Why?,I win. He tosses the gift to Wilson who catches it.
You faked a scientific miracle just to win a bet with Wilson? She follows him back to his office.,"Mmm, more an argument. I realize it would have been simpler to just fake the paternity test, but hey Christmas spirit and all that."
I think you're confusing nice and evil again. Letting a Woman deceive her husband by inventing a virgin birth just so you can,"And it obviously would have been more fitting if the baby had been born on Christmas, not just invented then."
"It's not leukemia. Seizures, liver failure It's eclampsia.",Which means we don't have one dead Patient. We have two.
I wanted to apologize. For all of the horrible stuff I did to you in high school. I'm sorry.,What's gonna happen to her?
I spoke to both sets of grandparents. It's too painful. They're putting her up for adoption.,What are you gonna do?
I already spoke to a Lawyer. I become a foster parent and then I adopt.,"Merry Christmas, Cuddy. He leaves"
I'm sorry. I just! I couldn't take the pain anymore.,"Either I need a new watch, or Mowgli is cutting into your Beauty Sleep."

Departmental budgets are due this week.,I'm gonna need an extension. Got some time next decade.
Cameron already turned yours in.,That's nice of her. Two questions Why did she? And why are you telling me?
Same answer now you owe her a favor.,I'm gonna need an extension. I got some time -

He's seen sEven different specialists over three years. No diagnosis and no relief.,"Oh, I am fascinated already. It's like I'm treating myself. He gets cured, and I get to learn a valuable lesson about the milk of huMan kindness."
"If I thought you learned lessons, I nEver would've quit.",So you're wasting a favor because?
I think you can help this guy.,rattling his Vicodin vial Drug-seeking Patients
I'd shoot the guys with the torches. Not one doctor this guy has seen in the past three years has been able to find a single thing wrong with him. What does that tell you?,who has continued to stare at the pills without taking them It means they're idiots.
"So would the carbon monoxide he sucked out of his car. It's not a toxic reaction. It's a psychosomatic reaction. The pain profile showed an excessive concern about his physical health, difficulty sleeping, getting out of bed.",He's not in pain because he's depressed. He's depressed because he's in pain.
"Not according to the pain profile you ordered. It's not a diet issue. We should start him on antidepressants for his sake, as well as his family's.",We're not diagnosing his family.
We're not diagnosing you either.,"It's rhabdo. Push IV fluids, check his urine, do a muscle biopsy."
What muscle? He says it hurts all over.,Then she'll biopsy all over.
Where are you going?,"taking his jacket from the coat tree If Cuddy can come in late, I can leave early. If you need anything while I'm gone, just ask Cameron to do it."
Means it's getting worse.,"Got to let the phone ring more than four times when you're calling a cripple. Chronic pain and pulmonary embolism, go."
How'd you know he had,You called after midnight.
Hypercoagulable state could cause pain and a PE.,You think the blood clot was caused by a clotting pRoblem. That's helpful.
"What if it's a cancer syndrome, like Trousseau's? Explains blood clots, multifocal pain, lack of obvious physical signs.","And why he's gone three years without anyone seeing it. Check his chest, abdomen, and pelvis for tumors. He hangs up."
That's not cancer.,No hurry. I already bathed once this week. I wouldn't want to look elitist.
Can't do anything till I write up an estimate.,Fine. Pad it all you want. Here's a check for the deductible. Don't touch the piano and lock up when you leave.
"Sorry, deductible doesn't apply here.","Well, I'm no arParktect, but I'm pretty sure the master bedroom is part of the home, which means the home warranty"

I'll help. She grabs her stuff and rushes out the door behind Kutner and Taub.,"Good thing we don't have a suicidal Patient with a horrific, undiagnosed pain disorder."
We did till we diagnosed it. We found intestinal edema and air in the blood vessels. Pain was vascular.,"If it was vascular, we would've seen unEven pulses."
His blood pressure was unEven. Thirteen and Kutner are doing an angio.,He had hemorrhages in his fingers.
There's air in the intestine. It has to have come from somewhere.,"thinking Yes, it does. He leaves."
Will that take away the pain?,"It will be completely ineffective, and the pain will completely go away. Cancel the angio."
He has air in his blood vessels. If we don't open the artery to his intestines,handing Thirteen his cane Where can air come from?
Air bubble caused the PE and cardiac arrest.,You tried to finish the job that you started at home.
I lied. I wanna die. Please just let me die.,No. He leaves.
"Is anyone keeping an eye on him, because this whole idea of suicidal watch was specifically created for suicidal Patients. I realize how you might've thought the name was just a coincidence.",Are there any visuals in this room that are key to us learning our lesson? 'Cause the telephone

The pain started in his abdomen near his intestine. The first symptom has got to be key.,"He's had multiple EEGs, all of them cleaner and squeakier than Cuddy's rubber nipples."
What about a glycogen storage disease like McArdle's? It explains the pain. Plus there's plenty of muscle cells in the wall of the intestine.,Fourteen is right. Kutner smirks. Go run an ischemic forearm test.
Take the garbage out on your way out. She hands Kutner a dirty diaper.,"If you want a Man to take your crap, you have to marry him first."

We're getting sued?,PRobably. That's Cuddy's pRoblem.
"Hopping pain, means it's something in his brain, not his body.",Except the pain's in two places that connect to two separate regions of the brain.
What type of Lawyer do you need? I'll bring it up at the next world domination subcommittee meeting.,Didn't say I needed a Lawyer. I said I needed the name of a Lawyer.

to Kutner Who represented the hospital when you set that Patient on fire? Chris Carrick.,Chris? That doesn't sound like a very good Lawyer.
"If we can't Even resolve body versus brain, we're nEver gonna diagnose the guy.",What was the name of the firm?
Caddell and Carrick. It's not like we can chop off his head to see if the pain goes away.,Need to cut off a guy's head.
And hearing me say no over the phone wasn't good enough?,I'm inconveniencing you because you inconvenienced me.
You know that foster-care official is coming in the morning.,"If they weren't, there'd be no inconvenience."
Do not try and force me to choose between my Parkld,I'm forcing you to do your job! If you can't also
"Fine, you want to separate a Patient's central nervous system from the rest of his body.","If the pain stays, it's in his brain. If it vanishes"
"And what about options three, four, and five? His respiratory system freezes, or he dies of infection, or he leaks CNS fluid like a fire hydrant, which would make him wish he were dead?",You need to scratch option five. He's already there.
"You preach objectivity, but as soon as a Patient comes in in pain, all you want to do is look under the hood. You don't care if there's a one-in-three chance you'll kill him.","If I don't diagnose him, there's a one-in-one chance he'll kill himself."
"This should numb Everything from your shoulders down. Any pain that's peripheral should be gone. House enters, not wearing a mask, of course. What are you doing here?",Just stretParkng my leg. Carry on.
Bad pain day today?,rattling pill bottle About to get better. Don't worry. He's making yours a double.
I remember when the drugs still made things tolerable. I still thought I had good days left.,Turns out you have to live to find out.
"You don't have a family, do you?",Left them all back on Krypton.
"You're alone. That's why you can handle your pain. No need to put up a front, to be what anyone else wants you to be. You're having more bad days lately, aren't you?",quietly after a pause Yes. Chase looks at House for a moment.
"No, but less. Four out of ten, maybe five.","Can't be. If whatEver is causing the pain is in your brain, it's still a ten. Periphery is zero."
Which one of you is House?,The big black guy.
"dropping an envelope on the table in front of House Chris Carrick. Next time you use my name in a threatening e-mail, it won't be just a bill. It'll be a lawsuit. He leaves.","to Foreman as he inspects the envelope without opening it Can you blame me? The last time that happened, the guy shot me."
What if the spinal block triggered some sort of placebo effect?,Guy's taken the finest opiates Blue Cross can buy. How come they didn't trigger a placebo effect?
"He just started screaming, do something! Please, God, do not let it be what his father has.",I think he's faking.
Where is he going?,Where is it?
Where is it? Where's what?,producing an empty bottle of rubbing alcohol from under the sheets.
You're hurting me.,"Remember the feeling. Maybe next time you want to help pops, you'll do a better acting job."
Fabry disease might be able to cause central and peripheral pain.,No angiokeratomata.
Lightning pain from syphilis.,All the syph tests were negative. They silently follow him into the Diagnostics Conference Room. Why aren't you guys still talking?
Something has to.,Unless! Nothing does.
So now you think,Mine's a more interesting version of nothing.
Opioid induced pain.,"Pain and the drugs that treat pain work by changing brain chemistry, sometimes to the point where pain receptors read painkillers as killer pain. Take him off the drugs."
"We can't cure him, so we're gonna torture him?",Torture is the cure. Eventually his body will recalibrate itself.
Assuming you're right.,Yes. I find it confusing to assume otherwise.
How would you like to stop taking Vicodin?,Good thing I'm not the Patient.
This is lunacy. You're torturing this guy on a hunch.,"It's the only hunch we've got. If I really wanted to torture him, I'd Manipulate a clinical trial in the hopes that he'd sleep with you."
Are you suggesting I got Thirteen in that trial because of some personal,I think you got her in because of your usual Messiah complex.
How's it false if the trials are showing results?,"Well, if it were that promising, you wouldn't have to change the schedule. But, hey! Hope springs eternal."
This was a cooking accident?,First time making cherries jubilee.
Awfully big fire.,"If you ask me, some of the portions in that recipe were off."
It's not working.,I know. I started him back on the pain meds! He drops his backpack behind his desk. She's still standing there. Which means you can leave.
My son was right. I tried for so long to protect him from! But I'm the one who's been selfish. This is no way for him to live.,"Until we get an answer, it's the only way."
There is no answer.,There's always an answer.
"Then what is it? He's been here four days. Three suicide attempts. You don't have an answer. When I saw you! When I saw the cane! I thought, thank God. The doctor will understand. Because I sure as hell don't. My husband thinks it's over. So look me in the eye, tell me you'd want to live like that. House looks down slightly and says nothing. Then stabilize him. Get him in decent enough shape for the drive home. She starts crying. So he can finally!",quietly Okay.
"You're insane. You know that, right?",Because I have principles?
Because you paid more to bribe me to lie on your claim than the entire cost of the repair.,"I don't care if I pay, as long as the people who pocketed my premiums for the last nine years also pay. I didn't break the pipe."
"WhatEver. If you want to stick it to the Man, that's fine by me. He signs some paperwork and gives it to House. You happy?","Nope, but I'm right."
"Nope, but I'm right.",Lock up on your way out. And don't touch the piano.
Lock up on your way out. And don't touch the piano.,Testicles. What do they make you think of?
"STDs, testosterone issues, that summer on Fire Island.","Oh, so close. The correct answer is epilepsy."
Epilepsy doesn't cause chronic pain.,"It does if it spreads to the sensory region of the brain, then rewires the pain neurons."
Would've shown up on an EEG.,"Not if the seizures are in a place you can't see on an EEG, a place too deep in the brain, like the area that controls the muscles supporting the!"

"It was lower, right? It's Everywhere.",But when it first started.
It started in the stomach cramps.,"Yeah, like bad gas, or a permeating pain! Like your kidneys were being pulled out through your scrotum."
sits up straighter. House's description seems to register with him. Why?,Because epilepsy is treatable.
You gonna pay for that?,Nice of you to offer. Now I can actually get some cream cheese.
29-year-old teacher. She works with special needs Parkldren. She,Love what you're wearing.
"Because Dr. Cuddy is not here. She's decided to spend some more time at home with the baby for a while. I'm taking over some of her day-to-day responsibilities, like babysitting you.",Interesting. You have your whole life ahead of you. So why would Cuddy want you to die so young?
She figured I'd spent three years working for you. I was inoculated.,Good.
That's why I took the job.,"29-year-old Special Ed Teacher coughs up blood all over Corky. No dyspnea, no weight loss. to Foreman Why are you smirking?"
"You're gonna destroy her, aren't you?",I am going to do my job. If that involves leaving her a rotting pulp!
Thoracic tumor is a better fit. Erodes into her airway and esophagus,"Oh, will you two stop it already?"
"Oh, will you two stop it already? Stop what?",Disagreeing.
"Okay, which one of us shouldn't have an opinion?",It's not an opinion.
"Drop it, House. We're seeing each other, end of discussion. Anything else isn't relevant.",It's extremely relevant.
How about you just Judge our ideas on their own merit?,"Oh, you don't want me to do that. Go run a bleeding-time test, confirm our Patient's blood is screwy, then you can come back and pretend to disagree about why."
"It's her platelets, looked like they had bite marks in them.","So now you're agreeing? Either you folded because I gave you crap, or you broke up, or"
"We disagree, you blame our relationship. We agree, you blame our relationship. Don't you see a pRoblem there?",Yes. Don't you?
Could be lymphoma.,Not with normal LDH.
ITP fits. We should start her on methotrexate.,"Absolutely, and total body irradiation."
"TBI will promote cancers, kill her digestive tract.","Don't forget, stop her from bleeding into her brain."
"It's premature, reckless, and potentially lethal.",True.
True. Must be somebody's job to stop me from being reckless and irresponsible. He gets in the elevator. Nobody can stop me from being premature. He chortles goofily as the doors close on him.,Got a Patient with ITP. Need to hit her with radiation.
to person on the phone I'm gonna have to call you back. to House Methotrexate.,"Good point. On the other hand, if she bleeds in her brain, she's gonna need a Special Ed class of her own."
"On the other hand, if she bleeds in her brain, she's gonna need a Special Ed class of her own. Fine.",Really?
"Yeah, if you think it's right, do it.","Hmmm. Some people thought you were gonna be brutal, marking your territory."
"Some people thought you were gonna be brutal, marking your territory. Who?",Nobody. Just because I call him nobody doesn't make me a racist.
"I'm not gonna play games. If you come to me with a request and it makes medical sense, I'll say yes.",I need oral sex. I'm pretty sure biological imperative qualifies as medical sense.
Can I return my phone call now?,I don't really see how that's gonna be possible.
Patient won't respond to methotrexate. Bleeding time hasn't improved.,You have a medical dilemma for me. I have one for you. I need a reason to not do total body irradiation.
Other than that Cameron said you can't.,She said I can.
Then why don't we just do it?,"Because it's premature, reckless, and potentially lethal."
Then why don't we just don't do it?,Because that would let Cameron in on the fact that I nEver intended to do it.
"This is gonna be convoluted, isn't it?","I figured I'd ask for something really crazy, so she'd shoot me down and get the whole I can control House thing out of her perky little system."
Unless we irradiate her. Without the radiation. We book the nuclear lab. We fill out the paperwork. We bring the Patient down there. We do Everything but flip the switch.,Go. Do. Don't flip.
"And is there anything we should be doing, you know, to actually help the Patient?","Trust me. In the long term, this'll help all our Patients. In the short term, double the dose of methotrexate and add prednisone."
"The Patient said she had to go pee. Maybe when she got up, she started to urinate. Increased the vagal tone, caused arrhythmia, and stopped her heart.",Who has to go pee in the middle of a nuclear procedure?
It wasn't really a nuclear procedure.,She didn't know that. The others look at him. People don't die from peeing.
Like the classroom with the broken heater and the cold metal table in the procedure room.,"Oh, for God's sake, get a room. Immerse her in an ice bath. The cold will activate her cold agglutinins."
Causing her heart to race.,Confirming our diagnosis.
And giving her another heart attack.,"Lucky for me, there's a flaxen-haired maiden who loves to say yes."
You hired me to do this job. Let me do it.,"Oh, I'm sorry."
"If you're gonna wait, you can wait outside.","Unless the new mother brings the baby to work because she wants to dump the baby, because she hates the baby and thinks she made a big mistake."
It's not a big deal. I was having a bad day.,Is Wilson gonna be in trouble?
For betraying my trust in a vulnerable time? No. Why would that bother me?,"He was worried, made a bad choice."
You saying I should give her back?,Much better than having a mother who doesn't give a crap.
What did you want?,We got a green light. Go draw the Patient's blood.
Go draw the Patient's blood. Why?,To see if it clumps in the cold.
She's making you confirm your theory before you treat?,She approved the bath. Just thought we ought to do a test to confirm.
I think she was playing you.,getting on the elevator Go draw the blood.
You come to procedures now?,Only the ones that might involve stopping the Patient's heart.
Cameron tell you to be here?,Shut up.
"He was extremely sensitive to touch, yet he had a! a tactile fascination with newspaper. I mean, he wouldn't read it. He would just! just touch it, crinkle it. I thought maybe that was a way in. Papier mch and! and it was. He let me into his world.",Please tell her that talking will ruin the test.
"All the kids I try to become a part of them, and then have them become a part of me.",How much longer till the heart attack?
"I wanted to be a doctor from the time I was eight years old. NEver wanted to be a pediatrician, though.",Now they're both talking.
It's not cold agglutinins.,I'm not surprised. She obviously has brain damage. Taub looks at him. Seriously.
"She screwed up a room number six years ago, and you decide she has brain damage?",Transposed digits. Classic marker for number confusion. Means she has a lesion in her left parahippocampal region.
I misdialed a phone number this morning. Must be contagious.,She also forgot to pee before your fake test.
So she has a small bladder.,Shows an inability to predict the future.
"Also loCated in the left hemisphere of the brain, close to the parahippocampal region.",Means the damage is ongoing.
"Two subtle clues, six years apart. That's hardly compelling evidence.",I'm compelled.
"That's not what this is. Every time a decent person comes in, you set out to prove that they have brain damage.",I nEver said her deranged personality was a symptom.
You don't need to. I've been here five years. I can hear your thoughts from my apartment.,Can you hear me now?
Move onto another organ.,I did.
The screwed up numbers and forgetting to pee points to her being a huMan being. The platelet dysfunction and cardiac arrest points to a pancreatic tumor.,Or multiple sclerosis.
Or we could not cut into her brain. It's just her pancreas. We should do an ERCP.,"Well, we could settle this with rock, paper, scissors, but, unfortunately, there are people who adjudiCate these disputes."
A pancreatic tumor is much more likely to kill her.,"Not this week, not next week, not next month."
The number confusions six years ago. You don't think we have time for an ERCP?,"The heart attack was six hours ago. Now, maybe it's planning to go into hiding for a couple years, or maybe it's gonna hit her lungs."
Stop! We have to assume it's the brain.,I'll go fire up the biopsy drill.
"No, we had to assume it's the brain until we prove otherwise. Do an MRI, T-2 images.",You want me to do another test?
"You should be able to see the MS plaques. If they exist, you can do your biopsy.",No.
"Even magnified images of her hippocampal region, nothing.",This is surprising.
So can we cancel the biopsy?,Go ahead with the ERCP.
I need to talk to you about Remy.,Who?
Who? Thirteen.,What did you call her?
She's on placebo.,And you want to change that.
"Or I respect your opinion, and I want to hear what comes to your mind.",Has she invited any of her lesbian friends into bed with you?
I was mistaken. He starts to leave.,Drug gonna cure her?
"turning back It looks promising, reducing symptoms.",No cure then.
"The question is, are those few years worth risking the rest of your life in medicine? No.","There, that wasn't so hard, was it?"
"There, that wasn't so hard, was it? Thank you.","You're welcome. Foreman turns to leave again. Unless you love her. Foreman turns and stares at House. If you love her, then you do stupid things."
"The surgeons were able to drain the pleural effusions. The Patient's breathing on her own, but she's still pretty weak.",Lung failure proves that one of us was right. Who said brain?
"Yes, you predicted that her lungs would fail, but the MRI was negative for MS.","I was right about the where, but not the what."
Are you talking about cutting into her skull?,"Actually, I'm talking about cutting off her skull, exposing her brain."
ERCP was negative.,"leaning over to hold Thirteen's hands And she agrees with me because she agrees with me, right, sweetie?"
All we need is a more sensitive test. Endoscopic ultrasound.,turning and grabbing one of Kutner's hands in both of his Just accept that you've been proven wrong.
adding his other hand to the pile You were also proven wrong. Why don't I get a second test?,"Because if I'm right about the brain, then we don't have time to indulge your wrongness."
getting up to leave Let me know when Cameron says yes to cutting off our Patient's skull. I'll be doing the endoscopic ultrasound.,"Good news. He comes the rest of the way in. I don't need your approval for some crazy, unproven treatment. I just need to do a test."
You wanna remove your Patient's skull.,Remind me to revoke Kutner's telephone privileges.
I didn't realize that was an AMA-approved treatment for MS.,"Not searParkng for MS, but what set it off equine encephalitis. Turned a cool breeze of MS into a Cat 5 storm."
I didn't realize your Patient was a horse.,There's been huMan cases.
Not when it's 30 degrees outside. Transmission is by mosquito.,"So she got bitten six months ago, or it's some other infection."
"You're asking me to let you cut off the top of someone's head. I need more than, I'll know it when I see it.",So you want proof before you let me go looking for the proof? This is the test.
You have to give me something.,"Cuddy's gonna love you. The Patient, on the other hand, is gonna hate you until the day she dies next week. Actually, this idiot will pRobably forgive you. He leaves."
Don't worry about it. It's just the picture that came with the frame. You can chuck it.,Kid with a raging viral syndrome and three dead mosquitoes. I'm off to storm the Bastille.
looking at a vial inside the baggie These aren't mosquitoes.,Fruit flies. Close enough.
Acute viral nasopharyngitis? One of her students has the common cold?,"Team's not what it used to be. On the other hand, Kutner ran his endoscopic ultrasound, didn't find peep."
So disproving it's her pancreas proves it's her brain?,"Yes. You used to do this job, remember? That's what used to pass for evidence."
Now I do this job. You brought me three dead bugs and a runny nose.,I can't find you the proof you want because it's trapped inside her head.
What do you want me to do? Say yes just because you're House?,"I'd certainly like that, yeah."
Cameron actually said yes?,"Nope, I'm just obsessive about clean cuticles."
Sawing off the top of her skull and placing electrodes on her brain is insane.,"Right, we should be retesting her pancreas for the umpteenth time."
"You're skipping steps because it's Cameron. You haven't figured her out yet, and you want to see how far you can push.",I'm skipping steps because our Patient is skipping steps on the way to being dead. If you've got a better idea!
"We should remove her spleen. Splenic lymphoma explains the damaged platelets, the heart, the lungs.","If this doesn't work, the spleen's all yours. He heads into the OR Unless I kill her, of course."
"If this doesn't work, the spleen's all yours. He heads into the OR Unless I kill her, of course.","Not only will this allow us to clock your brain's processing speed, you'll also get free cable for the first three months."

"I'd nod yes, but I can't move my head.",showing another flash card This pen is red. Its ink is red. Is all ink red?
Cameron's letting him cut into our Patient's skull based on nothing but dead bugs and someone else's runny nose.,"There are two pints in a quart, four quarts in a gallon. How Many pints in five gallons?"
"to Rachel Okay, all right.","That's my old boss. loudly And by old, I don't mean former."
Insulting me is not gonna make me go away.,You're not here. Obviously I'm not trying to make you go away. He holds up another flashcard. Hint the answer is a number.
Is she serious?,"Well, she's certainly not funny. Put the phone down. Pick up the baby. Make us all happy."
I can BP's dropping.,Get it back up. I got a whole stack of these.
"Oh, that is so annoying. Can you make it stop?",Baby's crying is annoying you? to Cameron What's her nerve conduction?
14.3. It's actually speeding up. But her BP's 80 over palp. We're gonna have to stop.,That doesn't make any sense.
"Please, turn that phone off!","Why does the baby annoy you, but no one else does? I mean, you're right about her, but"
Can't dose her with anesthesia till the last batch completely clears.,How come the baby annoyed her?
Her blood pressure's in the tank. I hope she lasts two hours.,What was different? Our Patient loves all things annoying.
She'd love this conversation.,"She's an earth mother, takes in the freaks and rejects of huManity and tells them they're a-okay. So what was different?"
"Her head was open, you were asking her questions, a baby was crying.","She had low blood pressure. According to the laws of physics, low blood pressure causes light-headedness, chest pain, but not annoyance."
Move your feet.,You decided to keep her. Thank you for telling me. You can go now.
I talked to her. We connected.,You talked at her. You had a chemical reaction.
Are you trying to annoy me?,I'm trying to explain you.
"I know it doesn't make any sense, but it was real. It was there. You want to hold her? to Rachel Come here. Come say hi.",taking the baby You think we'll bond?
taking the baby You think we'll bond?,Is that cute?
Is that cute? A little.,"If I threw up on you, you'd be pissed."
Your puke isn't as cute.,That's 'cause of your hips.
Plenty of people live perfectly normal lives without,entering Spleen's fine.
It's not her brain.,Of course it's her brain.
You looked at her brain. You took off her skull. You found nothing.,Didn't look in the right part.
She has a patent ductus arteriosis.,"When you get stressed, your blood pressure goes up and forces open the ductus."
"I know gas is expensive, but I could've given you a ride.",Elevator's broken.
"Dana Miller, the cancer researcher. Spontaneous pneumothorax.",Awfully thin file.
She just got admitted.,Lots of things can cause pneumothorax. Why don't we let eight or ten other doctors rule out the boring stuff?
We wanna take this case. She's maybe five or ten years away from curing retinoblastoma.,popping what looks like more than one Vicodin pill Which would make this case attractive to anyone who has some vested interest in people curing the incurable.
We have a case?,Did you just get to work?
Am I in trouble?,Did you take the elevators up?
"to House So, steroids for asthma?",Yeah. Do a CT looking for hyperinflation to confirm. The team files out

Elevators can be capricious. Sometimes it just seems like they're out to get you. She keeps playing with the blanket. Why would she do that?,walking back around to the front of the desk Why do you think the elevators would be out to get me?
"I don't know. Maybe they wanted to take time off to spend with their little dumbwaiter. But then they had to leave it at home with an elevator sitter, because you drove the replacement elevator to quitting because, you're incapable of listening to anybody but me. That's just a theory.",You're wrong. I don't Even listen to you. Either do your job or go home. Leave me out of it.
I am gonna do my job. It doesn't mean I have to do it happily. Doesn't mean I have to do it without resentment. And it definitely doesn't mean I have to do it without seeking vengeance on the person making me be here. Congratulations. You've officially dragged me down to your lEvel.,Okay.
You've officially dragged me down to your lEvel. Okay.,"to the custodian Hey, Blue."
"Well, then, why are you a doctor? Why aren't you sitting by a pool in Fiji knocking back mai tais?",People act in their own self-interests. You're all here because you're happy to be here. Or at least because it's your best option.
I'm here because I want to help people.,"No, you're here because it makes you feel good to help people."
So... you're happy to be here?,Does it show?
Could be pulmonary fibrosis.,Do a biopsy.
You said that would be stupid.,Does she know? Because Jonas Salk would not approve.
Your belly's full of blood.,"First her lung deflates, like me after a cold shower. Now her liver starts to bleed, like me after"
"Now her liver starts to bleed, like me after You okay?",Great. Just practicing my clown college audition.
We were in the GRC.,"Lung, liver, go."
Shouldn't you be obsessing over who did this to you?,Nope anybody bother MRIing our Patient's liver for tumors?
"If you're not obsessing, you must have already figured it out.",Yes. So I'm obsessing about why you're not obsessing about why our Patient's liver suddenly sprang a leak.
"There's a tiny spot on the caudate lobe. Could be a granuloma. He hands the MRI scan to House Erodes into the hepatic artery, causes the bleed.",looking at the scan What caused the granuloma?
"Blastomycosis. Could have been asymptomatic for months. It hits her lungs, we give her steroids. It blossoms and attacks her liver.","Get a piece of her lung, stick it under a black light. If it glows, sick Parkldren who need her souffls can breathe easier."
"Get a piece of her lung, stick it under a black light. If it glows, sick Parkldren who need her souffls can breathe easier.",Foreman.
Foreman. Again?,sitting down behind his desk You have a pRoblem.
"I told you, I didn't",Then you really have a pRoblem. The way she turned her head to look at the MRI... I think she's losing her peripheral vision.
Because she turned her head?,I'm happy for you.
I hear Cuddy's SEAL training finally came in handy. Should I be investing in a flak jacket?,You're safe.
"No carpet bombing? No burning of Dresden to teach her a lesson? Well, since you're incapable of taking the high road, I assume there's some deeper, more long-term strategy in effect.","Cuddy's not playing games. She's not looking for lEverage. She wants pure, unadulterated vengeance."
And your counter-move is to let her have it?,The only time to strike back is when I want something.
"Yeah, that makes sense too.",Too?
"I was thinking you actually feel guilty about taking her away from her baby. But your explanation's good too. It's completely inconsistent with your character, but whatEver.","Oh, thank you, rationalization Man. You have saved the village. You wanna eat? He gets down off the exam table"
picking up the file from the exam table You forgot your file. He sees the name on the file Dana Miller? The cancer researcher?,Not anymore. House opens the door and exits
"I did a free flap closure to avoid any scarring. She was lucky the scratParkng didn't cause any brain damage. But the first thing she said when we woke her up was, It still itches. He sits down beside Kutner","Itch receptors are only in the top two layers of skin. Which means she's not actually itchy, she just thinks she is."
"Why do you have to quit to do it? If I want to do something, I do it. If you can figure out a balance, there's no burnout.","Thanks for the lesson, Deepak. The itParkng started yesterday, not eight months ago. Meningitis, encephalitis... He snaps the Vicodin bottle shut and pops a/some pill/pills"
So would a brain tumor.,"Well, how 'bout we stop guessing and MRI her head instead?"
I don't remember demoting you.,pulling a folded up magazine from his hip pocket I brought you something.
"grabbing the magazine from him That's just a rationalization by working moms to justify not being with their kids. Which is fine, if that's what they want. It's not what I want. looking at the magazine And this is Nurses Quarterly.",The point is
Where's your cane?,heading for his office Where are your coworkers?
"Technically, it can't still be that, because it nEver could be that. She scratched through her skull while she was sleeping. Unless she was having a dream about fleas","talking to Foreman who has just entered and taken his coat off the rack Oh, hey, funny you should drop by."
"talking to Foreman who has just entered and taken his coat off the rack Oh, hey, funny you should drop by. We were just talking about this Patient of ours. Tell him the part about where two of her doctors don't show up Foreman opens the door to leave Where are you going? putting something in his jacket pocket and coming back into the conference room to Taub and Kutner Polyneuropathy. It's not in the brain, it's in the nerves. It explains the itParkng, the lungs, the liver. Shock the affected area, reboot the nerve she'll be fine.",following Foreman out into the hallway Foreman. How bad is she?
waiting for the elevator She's got a tumor in her optic Parkasm.,You don't need your coat to treat a tumor.
I'm going to the drug company.,"To tell them that you compromised their trial, your ethics, and the Patient's health? That's a great idea."
"They have records on hundreds of Patients. I can ask them for access, find out if other Patients dEveloped tumors and how they were treated.",This drug inhibits cell death. I think I could take a wild guess at how I treat that.
Stop taking it? Yeah. She tried that yesterday.,"Oh, my God, it's been a whole day, and her brain tumor hasn't melted away?"
"getting on the elevator I want to be able to tell her this happened to other people, and they're fine now.",So tell her.
I'm not gonna lie to her.,A little late for that.
You gonna tip Housekeeping?,looking at his watch Get it from Cuddy.
Don't tell me she burned your apartment to the ground.,"holding his leg and sitting up Warmth would have been nice. No heat, no power. Apparently Mrs. House called the utilities and told them we were moving."
We've been paging you all night.,"By all means, let's discuss the failed attempts to contact me, not the reason behind them."
Patient started experiencing spinal shocks before the maParkne was turned on. L'Hermitte's sign.,"Shocks without shock, an itch that won't stop. She needs Dr. Seuss. He pops a Vicodin"
"L'Hermitte's sign could mean Behcet's, B-12 deficiency.","No sores, no anemia. Where's Foreman?"
Could be another demyelinating disease. Why are you asking about Foreman and not Thirteen?,Because both questions are bound to have the same answer. Ebony and ivory are joined near the hip. Forget the brain. Look lower.
But an aggressive spinal heMangioma could.,Go find it.
Go find it.,You didn't answer the door.
PRobably because I didn't want to talk to anyone. You can leave your stolen key on your way out.,"I was looking for Foreman. I figured... He pauses, noticing that she is not looking at him You can't see. Where is he?"
On his way to the drug company.,grabbing the phone off a table Tell him to come back. I'll dial.
If they can help.,"You think that drug company has a magic tumor wand that no one else knows about? You need radiation, not ritual sacrifice."
"You think that drug company has a magic tumor wand that no one else knows about? You need radiation, not ritual sacrifice.",He asked for my advice before he switched you off the placebo. I told him to do it if he loved you.
He only thinks he loves me.,It's the same thing.
What he does is who he is. And the same goes for you.,"Slow down. Unless you want to radiate her heart instead of her brain. Of course, then your pRoblems would actually all go away."
Thanks. I'm not beating myself up enough already over this. Entering the left common carotid.,watParkng the monitor You broke the rules. Girlfriend went blind. You gotta be ready for losing to be one of the possibilities. You're at the carotid bifurcation.
I knew that giving her the drug would be bad for me if I got caught. I nEver thought it would be bad for her. Nobody else was having adverse reactions.,You did it because you love her.
Classic mesothelioma. It metastasized outward to the spine and muscles.,"Ah, the irony of it. Maybe she wouldn't be sick at all if some other lazy cancer researcher hadn't gone home early."
Where are Foreman and Thirteen?,"Shouldn't you be saying, Those weren't there when we scanned her two days ago?"
Mesothelioma shouldn't grow this fast.,Good rephrasing. Have Wilson do a biopsy to confirm.
Mesothelioma doesn't bleed.,So what causes masses that do bleed?
She'd be crawling with worms. We'd have noticed it. Gorham's disease and Kasabach-Merritt can both cause super-aggressive vascular tumors. His pager goes off and he reads it Patient's heart just stopped. He takes off toward Dana's room,So what causes that?
"We need to resect the vascular tumors, stop the bleeding.",Too late no surgeon's gonna touch her now.
So we give up? Just let her bleed out?,Don't be silly. You know what that would do to our malpractice insurance rates? We go on the offensive. Cut off the invading army's supply line.
You're talking about embolization?,"Cut off the arteries that feed blood to the tumors, they wither and die."
You can't kill the tumors without also killing healthy tissue. If we wipe out 3/4 of her lungs...,Let's hope that running marathons wasn't on her happy list. The elevator doors close
"holding out the cane I found this. In the, uh, coat closet. Where I hid it.","taking the cane and holding it up to talk to it Thought I'd nEver see you again. Little, little Greg. Yeah, you heard me right!"
"You are who you are. It's annoying, but... it's not your fault. It isn't about you. I! I! I'm sorry.",Because you were doing this job perfectly until the baby came along.
What? I'm apologizing. Can't you just accept my,I accept. We gonna have to do this dance again in 28 days?
What the hell is wrong with you?,"Yesterday, you hate me. Today, you're practically weeping on my shoulder. I can only assume that what I'm hearing is your aunt flow telling me..."
"When I was being a jerk, you suddenly act huMan. But when I act huMan, you turn back into a jerk.",Guess our cycles aren't matched up yet.
"This is your way of saying you accept my apology, isn't it?","Nope, this is my way of saying you were doing a crappy job before you will do a slightly crappier job now."
Or this whole thing is just an act. And you've gone back to the part you think you need to play.,"You should go talk to Wilson. Rationalization Man needs a faithful sidekick. Now, Rational Man needs to go save a life."
"House. If you're looking for returnable bottles, Kutner's already cleaned it out.",Damn!
So the nurses gave her pads instead of tampons. Is that diagnostically relevant?,Fact that the nurses had to give her anything is. Means she's bleeding from her uterus. He goes over to the foot of the bed
Women do that. It's perfectly natural. Not scary at all.,"She menstruating and, she's bleeding Everywhere."
Can't do surgery until her cycle's over and she stops bleeding.,"Well, let's hope she can hold out till then. In the meantime, get her a pint of cookie dough ice cream and a DVD of Beaches. He leaves"
"Dr. Schmidt. It's Foreman. Uh, actually, the trial isn't going too well.","You told them, didn't you? Foreman nods Well, you really had no choice... On account of being an idiot. They gonna pull the drug?"
"I broke protocol. Her results are no longer admissible to the trial. They don't have to do anything. Anyone else gets a tumor, they'll put a warning on the label.",Gonna keep your license?
They'll come after me if I attempt to participate in any more trials.,That's very decent of them.
"That wasn't your locker, was it?",It's a lock-er room. How else are they gonna learn? He leaves

House! It's one Evening. I'd like you to be there.,"Religious hokum, get sponge bath. Can I get back to you?"
Can I help you?,Just browsing. Thanks. Happy to be underaParkeving again?
Running the ER is slacker heaven. Looking for anything in particular?,looking at a file Not anymore. Where's this guy?
Where's this guy? Why?,'Cause he's my next Patient. It'd be rude of me not to introduce myself.
He's a drunk priest who hallucinated Jesus.,Afraid you might have missed something?
Afraid you're wasting Everyone's time? It's obviously either alcohol or exhaustion.,So you admit you have no idea which?
I admit that I'm too busy to care who you're screwing with. She walks away,Don't thank me. Just knowing I can be of assistance is thanks enough.
You went out of your way to pick him? This is nothing.,There are no small cases. Any guesses where this joke is going?
There are no small cases. Any guesses where this joke is going?,Could be psychomotor epilepsy!
Could be alcohol. Shouldn't we let the ER rule the obvious out,"Atropine toxicity, occipital lobe tumor."
You know something about this case you're not telling us?,Why would you think that?
Or screw with a hallucinating priest.,Both are possible. There's only one day to find out. Run an EEG for epilepsy. CT his brain for tumors. And go check his House Of God for toxins.

I thought you had an orgy planned.,I lied.
Are you lying about the Brubeck tickets?,"Yes, but only to save you from yourself."
"I'll be fine, and so will Cuddy if you don't show up. I'm surprised she Even invited you.",wondering It is oddly flattering.
S so what do we do? Nothing.,Cool.
It's cool he's a Parkld molester?,It's cool the priest doesn't beliEve in God. It's cool that God did to him what he did to the kid.
It's cool that God did to him what he did to the kid. Allegedly.,You think he's innocent?
He had honest eyes?,"And you think he's guilty, which explains why you're dying to discharge him."
"If Everybody lies, that includes teenage boys.",Aren't we lucky to have such an interesting Patient?

We're not splitting up.,So which one of you is taking a hike?
And neither of us is quitting.,Interesting.
You were fine with Chase and Cameron dating. You obviously don't actually have an issue,to Foreman You're fired.
How long are you gonna keep this up? We know you're not,Wrong.
"When my mistake blew up, you did Everything to keep me from contacting the drug company.","To save your license, not your job, and definitely not your relationship. So, badge. He holds out his hand"

Where are Foreman and Thirteen? They left.,Leprosy can cause necrosis and hallucination.
Why would they leave?,"Because Foreman doesn't work here anymore, and Thirteen is mad that I fired him."
"Because Foreman doesn't work here anymore, and Thirteen is mad that I fired him. Don't worry. She'll be back.

I've been wanting to introduce myself. He walks out,Are you really a virgin?
You have to treat me. You don't have to beliEve me.,"And before we treat you, we have to diagnose you. Not knowing whether we can beliEve you is making that difficult."
Everything I've told you is true.,You lost your faith because a teenager got confused?
"Oh, yeah. God wants life to have meaning. Life's meaningless without free will. With free will, there's always suffering. So, God wants suffering.

"You want us to tell a sick adolescent boy that he's really not an adolescent boy. That doesn't seem simpler to me. No, just, signing the consent form give him the meds.","So, you have pain in one arm and both your legs. Does it hurt right now?"
"No, its, when, I like put pressure on them. See, it hurts when I do this, with his right forefinger, he pokes himself on his upper left arm Ow, and this, pokes himself on his left thigh Ow, and this, pokes himself on his right knee Ow.",taking the Patient's right forefinger and squeezing it How about this?
"Heart's still working that means synapsis is still firing, we just need to get a message through.",Aaahh!
What the hell is going on? Close-up of House who looks guilty,I think my penis stopped breathing do you know CPR?
"Looks like your brain is Okay. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive.","I'm fine, other than the fact that my nurple is now purple. to Thirteen No wonder you broke up with him. I'm surprised yours are still attached."
"I'm fine, other than the fact that my nurple is now purple. to Thirteen No wonder you broke up with him. I'm surprised yours are still attached.","to Thirteen By the way, I can see that from here. I assume those are our Patient's lab results."
The only reason you'd ignore a near death experience is you don't care or you already know why it happened.,"It's called Vicodin, I took too Many."
"It's called Vicodin, I took too Many.",loudly Can I please get some information about our Patient?
I don't remember you taking any Vicodin today.,I don't remember hiring my Mother. What causes the enzymes in little Boy George's existing heart pRoblem and pelvic pain?
You didn't take any yesterday at breakfast either.,I don't remember having breakfast with my Mother.
"Protein lEvels are normal. This kid's depressed, if he's self-medicating with drugs and alcohol that would explain his symptoms.",Search the school search the home.
"Seriously, or are you just deflecting?",Both. He gets up from the chair
Where are you going?,"grabbing his jacket Nowhere, I'm staying right here, so we can properly discuss this. He walks out the door"
"continuing A pain that tears and bites and will not bend, only when I sleep, will it end.","Downer, and medically irre! his voice fades out as if he's falling back asleep"
If he's faking you think he's going to come clean because you said his name?,to Kutner with his eyes still closed Back off. Only Thirteen gets to grab my nipples this time.
quietly to Thirteen That is sweet that you're worried about House.,"Unless the next stanza reads, Hoping to fry my brain to death, I smoked some primo crystal meth, I'm not interested."
You can't deny that this kid may be suicidal.,We're not here to make him happy we're here to diagnose him.
"Well that would certainly explain the inappropriate responses. I gotta go. Okay. to House while putting his phone back in his pocket sorry, consult.",about the drinks When did you order these?
You off bourbon? We can get you something else.,I came here expecting a burger. Figured I'd have to endure a little lecture on moderation.
You nEver listen. So why,"Instead, I get a drink a nice little serving of respiratory depressant on the day that my lungs stop working."
You seem fine now.,You don't beliEve that I OD'd on Vicodin.
Funny how I'm usually right.,You think that I'm on Heroin.
Well? Wanting House to prove he's not on Heroin,Goodnight. He gets up from the table and leaves
You should ask your parents. You idiot!,"Okay, I admit it. I have bulimia. I look good though, don't I?"
"Heroin. Heroin! House, of all the stupid",I'm not on heroin.
angry I just caught you with your fingers down your throat.,I'm on methadone. Stupid product. Heroin without the high.
"Yeah, and twice the risk of death.",But no risk of arrest.
You nearly died.,Today was a fluke. I nodded off.
"Right, you're safe as long as you nEver sleep again. Mistime your dose, you die. Couple of drinks, you die. Mix it with the wrong drugs, you die. You want to detox from Vicodin? Pick something that won't kill you.",I'm not detoxing.
If you're looking for something to help with your pain,"Doesn't help my pain, it eliminates it."
"You still breathing in there? 'Cause if not, I'm sending in janitorial.","I'm not breathing, but it's strictly voluntary. Should've seen the guy who was in here before me."
I know about the methadone.,sighing It's legal. I have a prescription.
WhatEver doctor you conned into writing it clearly had no idea about your addiction issues Your lack of,He knows I'm in pain. What I put in my body is my business.
"You keep taking this, you could die.","If you'd said that if I keep doing this you could die, then it'd be your business."
"I can't sit by and watch you kill yourself. As long as you're in my hospital, you can't do methadone.",I'll send someone for my stuff. He starts to walk out
"That's it, you're quitting? You're choosing methadone over this job?",I'm choosing lack of pain over this job. He walks out
to House Who was she?,I hired her to watch me sleep make sure I don't stop breathing.
Home nurses usually wear scrubs.,She's not a nurse.
You hired a hooker to watch you sleep? That just can't He stops as House walks into the living room. He looks astonished,"Surprisingly, hookers are cheaper. And they don't sue for sexual harassment. holding up two ties Which one?"
"holding up two ties Which one? You, shaved.",The red one then.
You have two ties?,walking across the room to a small mirror on the wall Meeting at St. Sebastian's today. Gonna try and talk 'em into starting up a diagnostics department.
Sounds great. I just came by to check up on you. See how you were doing.,Tying his tie in front of the mirror I'm fine.
Which means it's not scleroderma.,"I have an interview, in two hours."
"I have an interview, in two hours. Wow.",Hand over my letter of recommendation.
"Sorry, I haven't done it yet.",You have no right to sabotage
"I was busy with this. She hands him a sheet of paper It's a list of requirements for your methadone treatment. Weekly drug tests. Supervised doses administered on a precise schedule, by me, or, one of the nurses.","Seems weird, getting my meds here when I'm working somewhere else."
Yes. pause I'm offering you your job back. She sits down,I want a raise.
I want a raise. No.,And a bigger office... but in the same spot.
No. We both know this is where you belong.,Okay.
"Welcome back. House starts for the door, then pauses and turns around",sincerely Thank you.
He leaves You okay?,I have issues with authority. You?
We thought you were gone.,Cuddy missed me.
And what happened to your cane?,She asked to borrow it for some reason. Patient dead or do I need to do anything? House takes off his tie and loosens his shirt collar
It's not scleroderma.,"Wow. Two days, and you've already got two separate theories. House sits down"
Which rules out scleroderma.,When did you two come up with this?
We ran into each other in the lobby. She sits down,"So, what did we miss? When I say we I mean you, since I wasn't here."
We've ruled out Zollinger-Ellison.,That was a dumb idea.
That was a dumb idea. Why?,Because it was wrong.
"Also toxoplasmosis, dehydration, SLE, various intersex disorders.","Oh, crap. pause This kid like energy drinks?"
But energy drinks don't explain,Nice work. He gets up and heads for the door
"So, we're okay?",Why wouldn't we be? to Thirteen about her shoes Nice heels. House leaves
Why wouldn't we be? to Thirteen about her shoes Nice heels. House leaves,This is all your parents' fault.
This is all your parents' fault. Excuse me?,"to Jackson Chug a lot of energy drinks before, during, and after practice? Jackson nods"
"to Jackson Chug a lot of energy drinks before, during, and after practice? Jackson nods",Your son came in here with simple dehydration. That's why he collapsed during the game.
The ER treated him for that. It didn't help the pain.,That's where the energy drinks came in. They put a strain on his kidneys so he needed more time to rebound from the initial dehydration.
Then why isn't he better?,That's where your idiocy came in.
It was your freaked-out overprotectiveness that nearly killed him. Nearly?,"He's young. A few weeks of dialysis, he should be fine."
"He's young. A few weeks of dialysis, he should be fine.",You gave birth to a freak of nature. He turns and opens the door Doesn't mean it's a good idea to treat him like one. House leaves the room
"Starting tomorrow, you'll come to my office for your fix.",I'm done with the methadone. I screwed up.
The kid's parents wanted that MRI.,I knew he didn't need it. I did it anyway. That's what got him sick.
You just solved a case that no one else could solve.,"I created a case. I played nice because, I was in a good mood because, I didn't hurt. He gets up"
You don't need your pain to be a good doctor.,firmly I'm not interested in good.
You're afraid to be happy.,Why do you care if I'm happy?
"You're afraid of change. The one thing you have is your intellect. You think if that's compromised, you have nothing. She holds up the dose of methadone Just take it.",No.
Don't do this.,It's already done. He throws the methadone in the wastebasket and grabs a hospital cane which is propped against the wall This is the only me you get.
holding out a file Cameron brought this up from the ER.,Doesn't look like a friendship bracelet.
"It's Phineas Gage, the most famous case study in medical history.",You're telling me this Patient got a railroad spike drilled through his frontal lobe? He takes the Patient file
Gage was a different person after the spike. Argumentative. Impulsive.,Whereas our guy became a different person after Chardonnay.
"He was sober when they brought him in. There's also the nosebleed, the collapse.",to Foreman MRI show anything?
to Foreman MRI show anything? smiling Nothing.,Good. What fun would that be? So the tumor's not in the cool neighborhood. It's cool neighborhood adjacent.
A well-placed tumor in the nasal cavity eroding into the brain could do the damage.,handing the file to Foreman Go stick a scope up Phineas's nose. See what you find. The team leaves
"Make this go away. to Taub, as he prepares to put the tube up Nick's nose God, that honker really is huge, isn't it?",Wednesday night. Low-down-blue-meanie versus the Incinerator.
Low-down-blue-meanie versus the Incinerator. I can't.,Let me rephrase. Low-down-blue-meanie
I understand monster truck code. Do you understand can't?,"Not when it follows low-down-blue-meanie. Is the world coming to an end Tuesday night? Otherwise, Wednesdaythey stop"
"All right, it's not can't. It's don't want to. The fact is, I just don't like monster trucks.","Yes, you do."
"No, I don't.",You've always liked monster trucks.
"No, you've always liked them. I've tolerated them.",What are you hiding?
Luckily jerkiness is a temporary condition for this guy.,"No, it's not. We may be able to fix his impulse to say his thoughts out loud, but he always gonna be the guy who thinks them."
"But he's also gonna be the guy who doesn't say them. If he spent his whole life constructing this nice guy persona, isn't that as much who he really is as anything else?",You would argue that. You're all persona.
"I agree with Wilson. This guy's a Harry Potter. House and Wilson look at him questioningly The sorting hat was going to put Harry in Slytherin based on his nature. He refused, so he ended up in Gryffindor, through choice.",There's damage somewhere in his brain. Go find it. Kutner leaves
Your tush is like the pistons in a Ferrari.,You're welcome.
That was for my benefit?,You're 40 years old!
You're 40 years old! 38,The administrator of a hospital!
Dean of medicine.,People don't get personal with you.
So that was your way of saying I look good today.,You didn't get the slightest kick out of that?
Just proving a point.,Anyone sitting here?
Just my persona.,"You know, it's amazing the way people cling on to insults."
So that wasn't an insult?,"I'm not suggesting that, like our Patient, you're hiding a dark, sarcastic core beneath a candy shell of compulsive niceness. House has pulled a fork out of his breast pocket"
I'm not always nice. I'm not nice to you.,Because you know nice bores me.
"Because when my parents put me in the rocket and sent me here, they said, James, you will grow to Manhood under a yellow sun.",And why'd you lie about monster trucks?
And why'd you lie about monster trucks? I didn't.,"I checked your appointment book. You got tomorrow night marked off, but you didn't put down what you were doing. So you thought someone might look at the book"
"I'm playing racquetball tomorrow night, with Taub.",Why would you hide that?
"Because the world revolves around you. I devote time to anyone else, you'd end up stalking me and harassing them.",You say that as though it wouldn't be fun.
We know it's not systemic sclerosis.,"to Taub Hey, Cyrano de Berkowitz. Let it go."
The CBC showed normal white blood cells.,to Taub So how long have you been playing racquetball with Wilson?
So he's a late bloomer. His daughter has a neurological condition.,"swinging his cane like a tennis racket First of all, Wilson played tennis on his college team, and you are a Jew."
Sandy Koufax is Jewish. Greatest left-handed pitcher of all time.,"Sandy Koufax is all you Jews go on about. Sandy Koufax, and the Holocaust. he sits down Gets old."
"There are dozens of congenital conditions that fit our parameters. We can't spend time gene testing for all of 'em, especially when we're only guessing it's congenital.",to Taub Is a z-shot offensive or defensive?
to Taub Is a z-shot offensive or defensive? It's both.,You suspected that was a trick question.
But I could have said neither. Diabetes makes more sense.,We can narrow the testing down to 40 likely candidates. Test for peripheral nerve damage.
He's got brain damage. He's likely to have peripheral nerve damage no matter what the cause.,"Yes, that's why we should not test him for it."
They have to be done Every couple hours. You're punishing me because you're jealous that I'm spending time with your best friend.,That would be petty. I'm punishing you because now you've joined my best friend in lying to me. Let me know when you're ready to confess Everything. The team leaves
Why'd you page me here?,still tossing the ball I need you to update me on the Patient's condition.
Seems to be dead. Why'd you page me here?,I need you to update me on the Patient's condition he sits up and holds up the ball while hitting this against the wall.
I finished the last blood draw.,I expect the people who work for me to rise to a challenge. Unless they don't expect to work for me.
Last blood draw was at 600 AM. Sugar lEvels nEver rose above 120 all night. Taub misses and has to Chase down the ball and start again,So the glucose was normal. Means you were wrong about diabetes.
hitting the ball again I still think it's the endocrine system. Maybe I just got the wrong gland.,So you're going for thyroid instead of pancreas? Makes sense.
Fine. I'm not playing racquetball with Wilson. I was nEver playing racquetball with Wilson. pause I thought it would be helpful if a Department Head owed me a favor. But it's not worth this.,nods Not bad.
"What kind of infection? It could be anything Staph aureus, tuberculosis, strongyloides!","Go back to Phineas, get a history."
We've got a history. He hasn't been out of the country.,Get a detailed history.
No one at home is sick. No one at work is sick. There's no sign of ticks or mosquitoes.,Get a more detailed history. Ask him again. And again until he remembers something. Taub starts to leave
Get a more detailed history. Ask him again. And again until he remembers something. Taub starts to leave,to Taub Not you. Kutner can do it. You're gonna be busy with something else. Kutner leaves
"Guy leads a boring life. They stay home a lot. No travel, no exotic pets, no nearby standing water.",You sound pleased about something. Can we get to that part?
"His wife rescues dogs. Among others, a big rottweiler who's taken over the House. Our Patient hates it.",Was the wife there to hear this?
Was the wife there to hear this? No.,Too bad. Keep going.
The dog marks his territory all over the living room. I asked what the odds were that he would have put down food or drink where the dog could reach. He said he put a glass of juice on the floor while he was fixing the television.,The dog was fixing the television?
The dog was fixing the television? Yes.,The Patient's eyes red?
Yeah. I'm thinking Weil's.,"Bacterial. He lucked out. Start him on doxycycline. If he improves, we'll know we were right."
I told Wilson you sent me to get information.,"And now you're telling me. What does that make you, a quadruple agent? They walk into House's office"
He let me print out his e-mails.,Wow. Excellent. Information he wants us to have. Did he let you print out his deleted e-mails?
Did he let you print out his deleted e-mails? No.,Then go back there
"As long as I was sitting there, I thought I'd print 'em anyway. He hands a stack paper to House Top one's the one you're looking for.",reading the email Writing to confirm Wednesday at 700 PM.
It's out going to jgonzaleznymercy.net. There's a Joan Gonzalez in oncology. It's a consult.,"Secret consult, 700 PM. He finds a picture of Joan Gonzalez online Oh, Joan is perky."
You're wrong. There was a Patient file attached.,Where? He holds out his hand for the file
It was password-protected.,"No. Wilson doesn't password-protect his Patient files. I'm the only one he'd expect Ever to look there, and he knows there's only one Patient I'd want to check on."
You think Wilson's sick?,"typing again If Wilson had cancer, there'd be no reason for him to drive three hours to Manhattan."
"I don't want to ask this, but, have you Ever had reason to think he might be depressed?","turning to look at Taub and speaking very curtly No. Get out of here. Taub leaves, House looks worried"
Get the hell out of my room. Kutner and Foreman leave,"getting up and approaParkng Wilson Your assistant said that you were out of the hospital, taking a walk."
Is there an emergency?,I don't know. Is there? You nEver take a walk unless you've got something you need to think about.
reading his messages Maybe you just don't have a good statistical sampling of my walks.,The other thing you do when you need to think is you come to my office.
Taub. another graduate of the House school of being a dick.,Private dick.
"Look, I'd love to stay for the full inquisition, but I need some hot coffee.","Of course you need hot coffee. It's 45 degrees outside, and you left your coat upstairs. Why?"
getting his coffee You're going to tell me why I forgot my coat?,"Once you get outside, the cold would have reminded you."
House walks in and Nick approaches him Nick Greenwald. I hear you're the guy in charge. I'm the Patient with the disinhibition.,"If you're here to say thanks, you're welcome. Now go away."
"Oh, I'm not thankful. I'm pissed.","Oh, all the more reason to go away."
They're talking about sending me home. To what? A life where I'll continually drive away anyone who might for a second care about me?,Those are the breaks. He walks over to his desk
You could operate.,You could die.
"So I'm either better or dead? I'm okay with that. he moves to face House on the other side of his desk I I've always been kind of a! an imPatient guy. But I've worked hard to keep my mouth shut. I've made my wife happy. I've made my little girl happy. I want that back. Otherwise, it's no life.",handing Nick's file to Chase I want you to remove a small pRoblem.
taking the file and glancing at it I'm not a neurosurgeon.,But your boss is. You could assist. I'm sure you'd like to add to your resume.
It's too near the brain stem. Nobody's gonna touch it.,Your boss would.
You want me to help you? He turns to face House Tell me why.,Why what?
Why you care. The puzzle's solved. The guy's alive. And the odds of coming out of this surgery with that same status aren't that great.,My Patient has a quality of life issue.
"He says awful things, hardly a medical condition.","with eyes downcast, not making eye contact with Chase When he leaves here, he's going to lose his family."
giving a slight nod I'll see what I can do.,looking at Wilson You've apparently got this whole coat thing backwards.
I may have overreacted.,You definitely overreacted.
I knew you'd meet me halfway.,It made me think.
Maybe the reason I don't always open up to you is because it's redundant.,Daniel Wilson.
"There have been new anti-psychotics dEveloped since he ran away. He's been on them for a couple of days, and by tonight, he should be in shape to talk to me.",But you're not sure if he wants to.
"I'll be in New York in a few hours, and I guess I'll find out.",Why wouldn't you tell me this?
"House, you and I! We don't have the normal social contract. I don't expect you to tell me the lies",I am fully capable of lying to you. I've lied plenty of times.
"I mean, collaborative lies. Giving someone a hand who maybe needs to deceive themselves, just a little. Wilson gets up For two days I've been thinking about how Danny's gonna react when he sees me. If I said that to anybody else, they'd say, don't worry, it'll all be all right. You wouldn't.",Because it might all go horribly wrong.
"he laughs Yeah. Yeah, it might. He turns to leave","In which case, you might want some company. Wilson walks back toward House as if he cannot beliEve what he just heard"
Feel free to send him an IM.,handing Wilson his coffee and sitting down across from him You told me you saw your brother once. After he disappeared.
"13 years ago. I used to go to Princeton whenEver I could. I must have hit Every homeless shelter in town. And then one day, I'm just sitting at this deli, having a sandwich, I look out the window, and there he is. He was gone by the time I got outside.",That's why you were so eager when I told you there was a job at Princeton. I thought it was just my charm.
That's the team. Shouldn't you answer?,They already texted me to say they're doing something stupid. Wilson smiles
We'll find out. They leave,The spell-correct on Kutner's phone has got a hair trigger.
"He closes his phone You took a walk in 45-degree weather, and you left your coat behind. Go ahead.",I think you were punishing yourself.
"The sParkzophrenia started when he was a teenager. When he was in college! He was on meds, but he'd still think a professor was out to get him because he got a B, or he'd fight with his roommates because he nEver showered.",Where were you?
"Med school. He, called me, Every day. Talked for hours. I didn't have hours.",Interesting. Later for that. Go on.
"I was tired of being the guy that Everybody counted on, so one night, Danny called One night, Danny called, crying, upset about something. I had to study for an exam. So I I hung up! Took my things. I went to the library so I wouldn't have to hear the phone ring.",I wonder how that turned out?
"My mother called me the next day. Danny had run away and left his meds behind. Which I knew meant that he would nEver be able to choose to come back, because he'd be so detached from reality.","So you made your one effort to live a normal, selfish life, and the universe immediately smacked you down."
You don't think that's a little facile?,"Actually, I don't."
It was a pretty big Event.,Hanging up the phone?
"We're not talking about my brother anymore, are we?",It's House. AVMs don't explain his glucose.
"Since this is a significant moment in my life and all, I! he shrugs",into the phone Yeah.
talking to House who is not listening I think I'll just go in then.,still talking on his phone Explain that.
Right. He picks up his coat and follows the attendant out of the waiting room. House is too focused to notice,You'd given him steroids.
It doesn't explain the organ failure or the brain damage.,This whole thing is an overreaction.
I'm sure she's moved on. Nick sits in a wheelchair and Audrey wheels him out of the room Kids are so resilient.,You okay?
I'll be seeing Danny again next week. I'd like you to meet him.,Sure. He sounds interesting. knowing that Wilson has more to say Go on.
"I thought seeing him again would change Everything. It would be wonderful or terrible. Instead! we're just strangers. It's kind of, anticlimactic.",Which is better than terrible.
Which is better than terrible. Go on.,Does it bother you that we have no social contract?
"laughs My whole life is one big compromise. I tiptoe around Everyone like they're made of Parkna. I spend all my time analyzing What will the effect be if I say this? Then there's you. You're a reality junkie. If I offered you a comforting lie, you'd smack me over the head with it. Let's not change that.",Okay.
"No, see, this if you were implementing the social contract, you'd say that, but only because! It makes me feel better!",It is kind of fun watParkng you torture yourself.
Do you think things will work out with my brother?,"No. But when it does go wrong, it won't be your fault."
"But when it does go wrong, it won't be your fault. Thanks, House.",You do actually like monster trucks?
"You have a Patient waiting, see? She indiCates Morgan West who is standing behind her in the exam room door.",I'm waiting for a follow-up.
I had colds all winter.,"I've been in this room a while, but it's spring now, right? He climbs off the table he was standing on."
I feel run-down like maybe something big is coming on.,"Run-down. Come on, give me something. Sore throat?"
Sore throat? No.,Runny nose?
"No. I know it sounds weird, I'm a nurse, but could you run maybe a CBC or thyroid up","loudly Dr. Cuddy, I need a consult. Cuddy enters. Until she stops seizing, I may as well go back to my office and get my diagnosis on."
She's urinating on herself.,She's having a seizure. If she hadn't peed it would!
If she hadn't peed it would! It's green.,Interesting.
It's green. Interesting.,35-year-old Woman. Head of nursing at an old age home.
Neuro is also written in green. Does that mean she has green neurological symptoms as well?,From now on I'm gonna use two colors. Green indiCates irony.
Why are we taking this case?,"Welcome, your lordship. We were just preparing your morning briefing."
"Sorry I'm late. And, yes, green pee does meet the only diagnostic requirement you care about! it's interesting. But is it worth us taking this case?",Us aren't taking anything. I'm taking. You're accepting.
"Okay, I accept. She has adult-onset epilepsy, and she really likes those Saint Patrick's Day beers.",looking away Go check out the House and the office for toxins and infections.
Her neuro exam was normal. No subsequent seizures. It's not life-threatening. It's not important.,"Luckily, neither are you."
"You got conned. Methylthioninium chloride. Notable side effect, green urine. She's a nurse. She knows the dosage. Knows how to fake a seizure. She pees pea soup and gets the warm attention of doctors all week long. She's a Munchausen and you're her mark.",So your insight is based on discovering an anti-Alzheimer's drug at an old-age home.
No good reason it'd be sitting in her desk.,You Ever tried to pee on yourself in public? It's not easy.
"Sorry, I rushed the Jewish frat. We peed in private.",For good reason. I can spot a fake seizure. Which means this was real. Which means her pRoblem is phenol.
"Carbolic acid? Yeah, maybe she accidentally inhaled some at a gout treatment facility circa 1890.",It's still in some antiseptic throat sprays. She's been chugging it all winter for her colds. Phenol explains the seizure and the urine.
She'd have to drink five bottles a day.,Which is why I'm sure you won't have trouble discovering evidence of it when you search her House.
"Oh, you were lying about the throat spray. That does make more sense. So why are you wasting Taub's time?",Because I don't want him to know that I'm wasting my time disproving his fake seizure theory. He indiCates zipping his lip. Zip.
Hi. Tests back?,Head CT was negative.
What about a thyroid uptake or abdominal ultrasound?,Sure. How about I flash some lights in front of your face first?
You want me to have another seizure?,We're gonna have to give up the room unless we can confirm a pRoblem.
We're gonna have to give up the room unless we can confirm a pRoblem. Okay.,Dammit.
"Please forgive me, I'm so sorry.",What are you worried about? You have maybe a night in jail for fraud. I have to go tell one of my employees he was right.
I'm not a Munchausen. I'm gonna die unless you help me.,You'll have to come up with something more original.
A cat predicted my death.,"Cats make terrible doctors. Oh no, wait, that's women. You're screwed. He leaves."
"A few years back, I was one of them. Good luck, Neil.","If you're going to kill me and rape me, please do it in that order."
"This is the cat, Debbie. Have you heard of her?","Debbie. Sorry, but without a last name!"
"She was in the news. We found her as a kitten. She lives in the nursing home. She only sleeps next to people when they're about to die. House enters his office and closes the door in her face. Ten Patients in the last year. And then yesterday she did it to me while I was sitting on my couch. Please, the whole staff, the doctors Even, we all know this is real.",calling from his desk Can you come back later? I have some business I'm conducting with the Prince of Nigeria.
"Just watch this video. She holds a tape against the door. It'll prove I'm not lying. Dr. House, I am begging you. She starts to gasp loudly and drops the tape. She puts down the carrier as she sinks to the floor. Chest.",Quick! Before she goes without attention for eight seconds.
Before she goes without attention for eight seconds. House.,"He gets up, goes to the door but doesn't open it. She's faking. The cat told me."
"Debbie the cat spends most of her time just prowling the halls, the queen of her own private world.","Gotta say, I don't think the changes they've made to American Idol really work for me."
You want to treat her? She's a nut job.,Don't we all have quirks? Aren't those eccentricities what make us huMan?
The doctors we spoke to also agree!,Nut jobs get sick too.
So you think this cat story is nonsense. And you admit she faked her earlier symptoms. But you still think she's actually sick now?,"Well, anything would sound ridiculous if you said it in that voice."
Confirm she's faking or I'm gonna have to kick her out.,There's that voice again.
I'll give you 24 hours.,Consecutive?
What are you doing?,"holding Debbie No, Mister Bond, I expect you to die. Bronchospasm, go."
"No cough, no fEver, and Blofeld didn't smoke a cigar.",He might have.
"Lungs were clean on the CT. Dogs can be trained to predict diabetic comas, epileptic seizures they can smell cancer. It is possible there's something in this cat.",It's more possible that it was just a coincidence. 10 million nursing homes.
Maybe the cat didn't predict anything. Might have caused the deaths.,We shoulda listened to Ted Nugent.
"Yeah, it could be cat scratch fEver or visceral larva migrans. Maybe he didn't kill Everyone at the nursing home, but it may be killing Morgan.",The worms hop from the cat to the cat lady's lungs. I could buy that.

What money worries?,"Extrapolating from the fact that he's been skipping his morning muffin, I'd say that he lost almost all his money on the market last year."
I'm on a diet.,I'm also extrapolating from the online portfolio you forget to log off. But it's mostly the muffins. Scope her for worms in the lungs.
There are no worms in the lungs.,What else could cause bronchospasm?
Why are you pushing a crash cart?,"Because Patients sometimes crash, and they haven't yet invented a crash tractor for me to drive wildly around the hallways."
You actually think the cat is going to predict someone's death?,"No, I know the cat is not going to predict anyone's death. Then I will have scientifically disproved!"
"You didn't keep this Patient despite the cat, you kept this Patient because of the cat. You're scared there's something to it.","If I could prove the non-existence of an omniscient God who lovingly guides us to the other side, I would."
"Cats' brains are always in alpha mode. The few scientific tests that have seemed to confirm psyParkc phenomena, that's where it takes place.",Please tell me that you were kidding so I won't have to fire you.
Don't you want to check their charts?,Of course not. This is a double-blind. I don't want to Even subconsciously

Look at Debbie.,"Good news, Mister!"
I told you to get rid of death cat.,Do you see a cat?
I see a litter box.,"brandishing his cane This is a disability, Dr. Cuddy. Can't make it to the men's room on time."
You pee on the mice too?,"Well, now you see the mice actually prove that I don't have a cat. There's a tank of mice in the corner."
Are these! are these the genetically modified lab mice from oncology?,Genetically modified for tastiness. He smacks his lips together sEveral times.

"Your team just completed a methacholine challenge, which came up negative.",Who told you about the test? Taub?
I'll nEver say. But yes.,"Her airways clamped down. I heard it. We kick her onto the street, it could happen again. I wish there was a lawsuit cat. It could warn you."
"I'm sorry, but if you won't escort her out, I'll have to get security to do it. She leaves.",You're joining me for a good-bye smoke.
I don't smoke.,Fine.
I'm not a super!,"How 'bout four years, that sound right? That's when you switched from a family insurance plan to the one you're on now."
I was married. I got divorced.,"Two years before that, you got Parkcken pox shots, which you only get in adulthood when you have a kid."
"It was my stepson, Timothy. She coughs as House continues to blow smoke at her.",What happened?
He was in school. He was having his morning snack. And he choked. And the teacher saw it and they did Everything that they were supposed to. He shouldn't have died.,You want to make it make sense.
crying What's wrong with that?,"It's meaningless, is what's wrong."
I can't breathe.,"Hey, doc. He calls over a doctor who is nearby. Breath sound soft to you, doc? The doctor listens to Morgan's chest and nods. Hooray! You're officially sick."

This is pathetic. You're still punishing me for calling you out on the green urine lady?,"Nope, this is for ratting me out to Cuddy. I'm not asking you to apologize, just scoop some poop out of a box."
"Now that you've delivered that important lesson, I'm gonna go test the Patient.","What, you think your bag's gonna die now?"
Now you're punishing me because you think I'm superstitious? What do you care?,It's not so much about me caring per se.
"It's brown. I didn't do anything, honest.",I'm just a girl who can't say no.
It is possible she's still faking.,hanging his cane on a bookshelf She didn't fake the bronchospasm. You think she's faking some stuff but not other stuff? Maybe she's Unchausen.
I'm just saying the brown urine doesn't make sense. What?,Nothing.
We've ruled out Every possible cause for brown urine. No blood in the urine. Liver and kidneys fine.,Brown could be fecal. A fistula!
How do we know the urine is still brown?,Had to be. Once you've gone brown!
"If we've ruled out Everything that can make the urine brown, what if it just looked brown? If the green dye nEver left her system, what plus green makes brown?",sitting Purple. Strep bovis infection from colon cancer. Paraneoplastic syndrome would explain the bronchospasm.
We scoped her when we checked for the fistula. There's no tumor.,"Oh, no."
I wasn't scared by the umbrella either.,"What? Not Everything's about you, Kutner."
I realize it's stupid. I just! I don't know Everything. I don't want to invite!,"Great, 'cause I thought your superstitiousness had to do with your folks being killed."

Sorry I was late again. I've got a long commute from the poor House.,Knew it when I hired you.
"Don't worry, I'm not quitting.",I know. Guy who signs a non-compete instead of just telling his wife that he cheated doesn't have the guts to quit.
Bad example. I did tell her.,"From guilt, not from courage."

standing and walking to the bed Thank you for showing me this. But maybe she's just confused in this new environment.,In 1844 a preacher in upstate New York added up some dates in the bible and predicted Jesus' return.
You're trying to prove to her she's not dying?,That would be dumb as she might be dying.
This Woman lost her kid. Why are you attacking beliefs that give her a little bit of comfort?,I don't care if her superstitions make her feel better. I just want her to think more clearly.
Oh. Maybe that could make her as happy as you are. The elevator arrives and they step inside. Where are we going?,"Experimenting. The backpack yowls. Another doctor in the elevator looks around. Stop it, Dr. Wilson. It's just not cute anymore!"
You already experimented on the coma guy. Haven't you proved your point?,Not to the Patient. And not to the millions of idiots who drooled over that news item about the magic cat.
Why are you so obsessed with this? Can't you just call her an idiot and leave Everyone alone?,"Hey, look, kids, therapy cat."
"You're a liar. Therapy animals are dogs, not cats.",Aren't you feisty? This one's special. If she likes you interesting stuff happens.
"No, okay. Uh, kids, playtime's over. The kids leave. You know what, this is a good thing. Because either you're starting to doubt yourself, which is healthy, or",I don't beliEve in the legend of goodbye kitty.

How Many times are we gonna watch this? There's no tumor.,"Oh my God, the death cat is attacking your legs. You're going to die."
Maybe it has something to do with that little red dot dancing around down there.,"continuing to point the laser at Kutner's feet Oh my God, the death laser is attacking your legs. You're going to die."
Maybe we're not wasting time. We wouldn't have seen a flat lesion.,Skin cancer could have metastasized to the intestines. Cool. Check for melanomas.
"Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Come here. Here, kitty. He opens the door to the conference room. She meows once but doesn't move. Kutner leaves through that door, instead.",What?
It's not cancer. We found spider veins on her back. They weren't there when she came in.,"Spider veins means Cushing's. Could cause an abdominal disturbance, brown urine!"
But the bronchospasm?,Cushing's myopathy.
I think she's dying.,I just told you it's Cushing's. We treat!
I don't mean because of the spider veins. Mr. Limpert died.,If that's my high school gym teacher!
"It's your coma Patient. He was stable for a year and a half, and he just died. The cat was right, House.","Here, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss."

Cat's nose is powerful. It could smell liver or kidney failure.,"Exactly, except if you'd glanced at the nursing home files I had faxed over this morning, you'd know that most of the Patients' livers and kidneys were fine what else?"
MRI's aren't telling us if the Cushing's in her adrenals or her brain.,So check her ACTH.
ACTH is 11.7. It's too close to tell. We can't treat the wrong organ 'cause that won't solve anything. She could have a cortisol storm.

You're playing pranks and this Woman could be dying.,"So have Chase do a venous sampling in her brain. If he finds something, it's there. If he finds nothing, it's the adrenals."
What exactly are you hoping to find inside your dead coma guy?,Catnip. Chew toy. I don't know. That's why I'm looking!
"enters with Foreman Your Patient had cardiac arrest during the venous sampling. We got her back, but her heart's still tenuous.",That tell us anything?
"She's weak, possibly dying.",So nothing. What about the ACTH?
What about the ACTH? Slightly elevated.,That confirms the Cushing's is in the brain! go.
Are you sure that it's Cushing's? You'd expect central body obesity. She's in good shape.,"If it had a normal presentation, there wouldn't be a cat involved."
So it's the brain. That means the next question is whether to remove the pituitary right now!,That's not a question for me. That's a question for the Patient. You'll present both sides and let her decide.
I've got to stop telling you my theories. You always just try to prove me wrong.,You mean the theory about Cuddy's ass getting bigger at the full moon? I confirmed that one. Photo's on my blog.
"Normally, you'd be up in the Patient room hectoring her on what to do. Instead you're up to your elbows in some irrelevant dead guy who may or may not be connected to a magic cat because you want to prove to me that you don't care.",Case is over. I'm exploring a scientific mystery.
I'll schedule an operating room.,Early.
I'm not staying long. I'm quitting.,You got a new job?
You got a new job? No.,"Well then, you're not quitting. See you back here tomorrow."
You're not accepting my resignation?,"Easier this way. It avoids the whole thing where you panic, run back and grovel, and I punish you and then take you back."

Bring donuts. Everyone loves those bear claws.,"Here, puss, puss, puss, puss, puss. Puss?"
Did you give him the money yet? No.,"I was right. And more satisfyingly, you were wrong. It was a coincidence. The cat was not predicting deaths. It was just trying to keep warm."
"Yes, dead people are renowned for their warm glow.","They are if they're fEverish, like three of the Patients were. Or if they're wasting away, like the other eight."
"Or if they're wasting away, like the other eight. Wasting doesn't!","Yeah, it does. If it means someone sticks a heating blanket on you."
"Congrats. Because of your crazy obsession with this cat, you've solved a completely trivial mystery.",Completely trivial.

Just curious. Thank you.,I wouldn't come here for thanks.
But I didn't.,You didn't didn't do anything. I stopped it.
And what made you do that?,Science. Logic. Reason. Pick any three.
A cat chooses that exact moment to sit on your computer. Maybe that's science and logic and reason or maybe it's something else.,You're an idiot.
I looked up the preacher from New York State. His followers nEver faded out. They became the SEventh Day Adventists. A major religion. That Man changed the course of history.,Because his followers were as deluded as he was.
Maybe he just gave them something to live for.,Feel better. He leaves.
Feel better. He leaves.,Kutner! Kutner comes in from the conference room. Cat pee on my chair?

It was his idea. He saw the rash,"If he did, he'd have hung a mission accomplished banner in my outer office."
Don't toy with him. If you're going to fire him,The fact that he stole your idea means that he cares enough to lie. That's all I needed to know. Rat pee. That's a very nice idea.
House. You left this in my office. He hands House a cell phone.,"No, I didn't. So either I have a hole in my pocket"
"Oh, that's right I remember now, I stole it. Because if you had gone up there to check out my girlfriend, you wouldn't have come back here and lied to me about it. You would've thrown her right in my face.",You underestimate the entertainment value of your obsessions.
And then there were all those calls you weren't taking in front of me. House stops and turns to look at Wilson. So I dialed the number of the calls you weren't taking. You're seeing a psyParkatrist.,You had no right to invade my privacy. He reaches under Lee's pillow and pulls out a recorder.
Is! is that!?,Yeah. It's irony.
Hey. God sent you.,"Suddenly, you're not so fascinating. He leaves."
You're spying on your team.,"Prioritize, Wilson. Is that what you really want to torture me about right now?"
I don't want to torture you at all. I think this is a great thing. Not something you have to drive an hour out of town to shroud in mystery.,Yeah. Whining on someone's couch. That's an excellent use of my time. Maybe I'll discover that my Parkldhood wasn't perfect.
So your attitude about therapy clearly hasn't changed. And yet you went. Which leads me to beliEve that maybe something else has changed. The stop by the elevator. Maybe you think you can change. Credit Cuddy with that.,"Not much credit to take, because I'm not going back."
"Oh, House, please! I assume you went because you're tired of screwing up Every chance you get at happiness.",fiddling with his phone Delete contact.
Do not let the fact that I found out about it,Don't beat yourself up. I'm not going back because it doesn't work. He enters the elevator and pushes the key to confirm the delete.
"54-year-old Woman with acute respiratory failure. No anaphylaxis, lung issues or tracheal lesions. Tox screen was clean for coke and amphetamines.","I will give you 30 reasons, one for each pound that cause the apnea which enflamed the epiglottis. Why is our rainbow coalition missing brown and bi?"
No apnea because no sleeping pRoblems when she's sleeping. She spent the last six months caring for her husband who's dying of heart failure.,Reason 31 whatEver whacked the husband's heart is also whacking her airway and!
I contributed. And the Patient's illness wasn't caused by her husband unless lung cancer's contagious.,Interesting.
Could have picked up melioidosis from one of the islands.,Would have jumped to the husband and finished off him and his lame immune system.
"No tumors, no drugs, no bacteria. Leaves viral varicella zoster.",Start her on IV fluids and acyclovir.
Can't. She's deManding to be released so she can get home to her husband.,"How sweet. They can die together instead of separately, 40 years apart."
The mind can heal the body. Seeing his wife in distress might have actually slowed down his death.,Or he could have just had an adrenaline surge when he saw his chance to hit the singles market. Send her home.
The pageant starts in an hour. You have to do something. There's something wrong inside her head. It's like she has no idea what's going on around her. She waves her hand in front of her daughter who doesn't react.,I thought she was just flirting with me.
Think of it as Costa Rican sober juice. She's drunk?,That little minty scent hiding beneath the rose petal perfume and the cherry blossom moisturizer and the morning dew hair spray.
slurring Gotta be perfect.,You spit it out?
She can resume her vigil over her husband who started fading again.,"Win some, lose some. And strictly speaking, since he's not my Patient, win some. Look at the time. It's half past Taub was lying about Kutner."
"He pRobably went to a comic book fest, spent the night at some Wonder Woman's lair. I'm sure he'll","Find out what or who he's doing. Either way, Cuddy's gonna want me to write it under reason for termination."
He's cold. Eric!,He didn't say anything? To any of you? Family pRoblems? Bad relationship? Financial pressures?
His parents were shot right in front of him.,Parents are ancient history.
Not to someone who actually cares.,He didn't slit his wrists and!
You're blaming us?,shakes head slightly Just trying to figure it out.
This isn't our fault! Something like 25% of suicidal people show no outward signs of depression.,No. 25% of suicidal people have friends who didn't notice anything and don't want to feel guilty.
"We still have a Patient. Actually, two. One worsening, one who should be worsening.",You can't be in denial about Kutner and the husband.
It's possible Eddie's body is willing itself to live.,"Well, call the tabloids. Tell them you just witnessed the miracle of slightly increased kidney function."
Maybe we should pass this file over to another doctor.,And the next one too?
"I'm sorry. I've hired a grief counselor whom I'm sure none of you will see and I'm offering time off, which I'm sure none of you will take. But just know it's available. Long pause","Polyserositis fits. Start her on indomethacin. He heads for his office, followed by Cuddy."
If you'd rather not deal with this case!,I'm fine. Despite what Wilson will say.
He hasn't come to you?,Pretty sure he has mah-jongg Tuesday mornings. I assume he thinks I will work through this better if I don't have to keep flicking his wings off my shoulder.
You didn't Even have an inkling?,I know his fantasy football team cratered. Figured he'd gotten over it.
Well! Sorry for your loss.,Thanks. But it's not my loss.
Then I'm sorry you don't think it is. She leaves and Foreman and Thirteen come in from the conference room,Patient's membranes aren't gonna heal themselves.
Taub went to run the treatment. We'd like to go see Kutner's parents.,I'll join you. He takes a Vicodin.
Wish we did. We all,"It was his name. He was conflicted, didn't know where he fit in, being ripped out of his world and stuck into yours."
We encouraged him to hold onto his heritage.,It's hard to still be Lawrence Choudhary when Everyone sees you as Kutner.
It was his idea to take our name.,Then you should have said no.
Then you should have said no. House.,"All his Anglo name gave him was the illusion that he was someone he wasn't. You were being emotional, not rational. You didn't understand him."
"We loved that boy, you son of a bitch.",You wanted to make him happy by shutting out his pain.
House! Go back to the hospital.,I'm sorry about your son.
"Indomethacin had no effect. She's still in pain. Rules out polyserositis. I ran a hormone panel on Eddie. His prolactin's above normal. Means he's actually improving. Body chemistry changes for all sorts of reasons stress, fear! Why not love? But maybe he's going into some sort of remission/",You haven't asked if I learned anything relevant from the Kutners.
"If you had, I'm sure you would have mentioned it.",Or you're afraid there is something relevant. Which would mean you could have saved him.
I don't buy that suicide is always a cry for help. Sometimes you just don't want help.,Good thing you got some. Or you'd have tried again and gotten it right.

How could she be! The windpipe thing?,That was real.
We haven't been this close for years. I wanted to hang on to that. Ow!,"Oh, please. People hate reruns."
It's my leg. I swear this is real!,"What, you pinky swear or you just plain swear? Because"
How can she fake that? He pulls back Charlotte's sheet. Her left lower leg is much smaller than the right.,She can't.
Her left lower leg is much smaller than the right. She can't.,"So, what can shred an epiglottis and make muscle disappear?"
Mr. and Mrs. Kutner. They caused Kutner's death. Why not Charlotte's?,Mourning period's over.
So what now? You gonna insult your way through his Rolodex till you find someone with an answer?,I've been polite to the friends I've called. All of whom were useless.
They weren't useless. They just didn't know anything more than we did.,"Tomato, tomah-to."
"MS. Weakens myelin sheath, compromises nerve conduction. I'm talking about Charlotte, the one who's still alive.","to Foreman and Thirteen You two, stick her in an MRI."
"to Foreman and Thirteen You two, stick her in an MRI. Confirm MS. to Taub And you, run the echo on Eddie that you're planning to do behind my back to see if his heart's improving.",Did you let me hire a pervert?
Did you let me hire a pervert?,Kutner's police background check from when he started. He was charged with indecent exposure.
"Kutner streaked at the Penn-Dartmouth football game. Precisely the kind of thing you'd expect him to do. It's okay. You should be upset. He thought like you, pushed boundaries like you","If he thought like me, he would know that living in misery sucks marginally less than dying in it."
"For the record, I'm uncomfortable violating a dead colleague's dignity.",It's only violating it if you find something. Good to see you.
What are we looking for?,He was hiding. Why?
Shame? Fear? Are you okay? It's okay not to be okay.,reading a card in a trophy case Colonial Warrior Blaster. Number One One. He spent months tracking this down. He had passions.
He was obviously in pain. Does it really matter why?,He hung the bad with the good.
"Here's how we're going to handle this, House. We're going to leave here and go to the closest bar and drink and tell stories about the time Kutner almost blew up an OR. And pass out in our own sick. Sound like a plan?",What am I missing? to Wilson You've got that look. You figured this out.
You're not here because you care about Kutner. You're here because it's a mystery. You're here for the puzzle.,What if I didn't miss anything 'cause there's nothing to miss? He didn't kill himself. He was murdered.
Autoimmne hepatitis? Did you page Foreman?,Took up Cuddy's offer of time off. Normal thyroid means no hepatitis.
"Could be Amyloidosis. Amyloid buildup hits the organs, tissue",Her muscles wouldn't have atrophied. You run the echo on the husband?
Heart's still failing. The improvement was only temporary.,"I prefer the less subtle answer You were right, House."
House! it was a suicide. The police have already investigated.,"They investigated what they saw, not what they didn't saw. Talk to friends, classmates, pizza delivery guy. And draft Foreman. He can make calls through his tears."
He can make calls through his tears. No.,"Is that No, I'm not calling my boyfriend, who apparently called my boss instead of me to say he wasn't coming in?"
We all want to know why Kutner did it but we're not gonna waste time chasing ghosts.,You're not remotely curious?
Only why a Man who embraces the rational is suddenly pursuing the irrational.,She could have alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency. Run her AAT proteins.
IT's been trying to close out Kutner's email account. Apparently someone's still logged onto it.,It wasn't hard to figure out that his password was Kutner. He did what they tell you not to do.
He wasn't murdered.,But his parents were. And the guy who killed them is coming up for parole.
He's coming up for parole. He's not out on parole.,Kutner testified at Every one of his hearings. The guy wouldn't be the first to see the clock ticking.
He was killed by his own gun.,"Which he bought years ago, obviously for self-defense."
In the temple. Cops found residue.,Right. The murderer would nEver try to make it look like suicide. That would be unethical. Cuddy stands up to leave You haven't asked about my Patient.
You're waiting on an AAT protein results.,Means you checked up to see that I'm still on it.
voice over She's stable. But whatEver was left of her liver is definitely shot now. And there's no change in Eddie.,"So, thanks to her idiotic move, she's dead in 24 hours if she doesn't get a new liver."
It was selfless. She loves him.,How does that disagree with what I just said?
"No diagnosis, no liver. No liver, no living.",What do you know. It is myelofibrosis. He starts writing on the paper. Says so right here. Who wants to tell Cuddy?
How Many times have you lied to the transplant committee?,Just twice.
How Many times has it worked?,I don't quite see how that's relevant. His pager goes off. He checks it. Cheese it. It's the coppers.
grabbing his pager We're not just going to leave them to die while you fixate on Kutner.,"Technically, he's not our Patient. So I'm really only leaving her to die."
We've already explored the usual options. Shouldn't we at least explore unusual ones?,Absolutely. He goes to his desk and picks up his phone Don't worry. This is why God gave me two ears.
Kutner would say we should just come clean with Cuddy.,"Wow. If only he were here to say that. I'm sure Cuddy would be bound to fall for the old, Hey, the dead guy won't mind if we're wasting"
"Wow. If only he were here to say that. I'm sure Cuddy would be bound to fall for the old, Hey, the dead guy won't mind if we're wasting",Need an incurable roMantic to talk to an incurable roMantic.
Kutner wasn't murdered.,You deduced that by removing your sunglasses to the strains of a Who song?
Suicide means you could have helped him. Murder lets you off the hook.,shows Cameron two films.
Partial won't be enough. She needs a whole liver and he'd nEver survive the procedure.,"Nice symmetry, huh?"
gets it He dies on the table and you give her his whole liver.,"If he's gonna do this, he's gonna do this for love. I though he should talk to someone who spoke the language."
You can't do the transplant.,Only if he said no. But your urgent hovering means he said yes.
His fingers have nodules. I think his doctors misdiagnosed him.,Or you sprinkled too much wishful thinking in your tea.
Obese Man with lung cancer Two easy explanations for his heart failure. Nodules can mean something else. Something curable.,Go back to the ER. My thanks to you and your cold feet.
"What's going on? I'm giving you a shot at a cool result. Better yet, a chance to prove other doctors idiotic.",Except you're wrong.
You figure that out by taking off your sunglasses to the strains of a Who song?,The guy who killed Kutner's parents died of an aneurism two months ago.
Kutner hid from Everyone. You didn't get a chance to save him. No one did. Run the tests. Find out if you have a chance to save Eddie.,Bad news.
But how come I was getting better without the medicine?,Your emotional state bumped your Catecholamines which helped raise your prolactin.
My emotional state?,"Three months of treatment, you'll be back to your buff, Parkseled self."
I don't want the treatment. Do the transplant.,But you'd be trading the certainty that you'll live for the uncertainty that she'll live.
I was ready to die anyway.,Now you get to be nicer to your next wife.
You're basically asking us to commit murder.,I was yesterday too.
There's a difference when he has 20 years to live instead of two days.,Not really. Not legally.
"That's your way of convincing us to do this, by saying it's no more immoral?",The idiot is gonna do this with or without us. This way we can protect the organ.
We should be protecting him.,"So we strap him to the bed, wait till his wife dies?"
She spiked a fEver. LP shows her white cells through the roof. She's infected Everywhere.,I should fire you.
Infection means we have a new clue.,And a full two or three hours to figure it out.
Sarcoidosis hits the spleen and the liver.,She would have lung issues.
Scleroderma inflames the tissue.,No skin or GI pRoblems. He sighs What is she hiding?
You don't know that,angry Either we have all the clues and we're idiots or we don't have all the clues.
"Possible exposure, people, places.",Both.
"Possible exposure, people, places. Both.",Bad lie. Did you really think the beaches in Hawaii were just like the beaches in Rio? The disease bearing sand flies are completely different.
She's nEver been to Rio.,Who'd you go with?
Why are you doing this?,I don't actually need to know who it was.
"turns her head toward Eddie, slowly Last year! It was nobody you know. Rio was supposed to be ours. I got tired of waiting. I'm so sorry.",to Taub on his way out Start her on antimony and have Cuddy find her a liver.
I was wrong about you.,"No, you weren't."
You're in pain.,And you're roManticizing. Again.
You worked with him Every day for two years and you nEver saw this coming.,No one saw it coming.
"But you see Everything coming. This has nEver been about what you missed. This is about why you missed it. You're terrified that you're losing your gift, losing! who you are. And I'm terrified of what you'd do then.","Unless you feel there's more to do here to cure me, don't you have a funeral to go to?"
He's seen three different specialists.,Interesting. Almost as interesting as you trying to step into Kutner's shoes just days after he stepped out of them.
"If he was trying to fake an illness, why would he consent to be seen by the best diagnostician in the country?",Now who's trying to get her hybrid waxed?
That's normal. Sometimes this test causes vertigo He turns toward Cameron and vomits and nausea.,Cameron just brought me a case.
"Cameron is happy in the ER. There's no way she wants her nose back on your grindstone. he orders Egg white omelet, no bacon, whole wheat toast.",I say it's not my grindstone she's after. And not her nose she wants on it. She and Chase are practically living together. What did you just order?
What did you just order? An omelet.,Since when do you pass on the swine? And wheat toast? Might as well eat a sheet of sandpaper.
Yes. But I don't like eating the same thing two days in a row.,Your bro's nurse not lovin' the love handles?
"I'm just not in the mood for bacon. And you're obviously trying to avoid talking about Kutner. Which is odd, because you spent a whole week obsessing about why",He's no longer on my team. I'm sorry he's no longer on my team. Nothing else to talk about.
You're wearing the watch he gave you for Secret Santa.,"displaying the watch Five functions, including a stopwatch to time how long it takes you to ask me if I'm okay."
You gonna order?,Not hungry. He takes a Vicodin.
And you know this because,"She changed her shoes. If he was faking, he'd have vomited on the other side of the bed."
Could also be our only warning before a massive stroke.,Do a Holter and a carotid Doppler.
No sight of heart or arterial pRoblems but he's been hiccupping on and off for over a week.,"Nice. I'm hooked. You can get back to your shift at the ER. Except, as far as the ER is concerned, you're on vacation, right?"
I postponed a trip because I'm concerned about the Patient.,"Explains why you ditched Chase and came to differentials, not why you ran the tests."
You told me to.,"Well, I'm not your boss, as you usually take great pleasure in pointing out. Hey, you don't still have the hots for me, do you?"
I care about the Patient and I care about the people who work on your team. They've been through a lot lately. I just thought I,Was Florence Nightingale. Yeah. You're gonna nurse us back to spiritual and mental oneness. That would make sense if we were having this conversation a week ago.
"Think what you want that I'm here to get a job, that I'm here to wrap you in swaddling clothes.","The pRoblem is, I think neither. Because neither makes sense. The only thing that does! doesn't."
Pathological hiccups plus inability to balance. Go.,What she said.
Brain would connect the two.,"It could, if Cameron hadn't already CT'd his head. Empty as her boyfriend's calendar."
What does this have to do with Chase? Nothing.,at the same time Not sure yet.
It's possible it's not connected to a protest. MS wouldn't show on the CT and his name's Swenson. Scandinavians have an increased susceptibility to MS.,Better theory than he's faking it. The clogs have it. Do a lumbar puncture to confirm MS.
I guess we'll just continue to twiddle our thumbs.,"God, I hope that's a euphemism."
How am I supposed to do a lumbar puncture on a Patient with intractable hiccups?,I'm trying to figure out what that could be a euphemism for. Taub sighs You'll find a way. Cameron sighs
He leaves Dr. House?,"Sorry, I'm just the Zone delivery guy."
"I'm, uh, Doug Swenson's wife.",His history said the environmental kamikaze was single.
"He, um, he pRobably didn't want me to worry. He told me he was in jail with some of the other protesters.",Yeah. No worries there.
He's in jail a lot. Not so often in the hospital. I searched his e-mail and I found the referral to you yesterday.,You must really love your husband and travel by rickshaw.
"Uh, I had to find somebody to take care of our four-year-old son. Doug's all right, isn't he?",I have no idea.
The doctor in the office next to yours said that you might be here.,I got it figured out.
That mean we don't need to do the LP.,indicating Cameron I was talking to her. You're not Even supposed to be here.
You want us to stop or not?,"What? Oh, I don't care what you do with him. You're not doing a favor for a doctor in Philly. You're doing a favor for an oncologist in North Jersey."
I'm spying on you for Wilson?,"Spying, preemptive grief counseling."
Wilson sees you ten times more than I do. He's a better liar and he wouldn't have to cancel a vacation to do it.,Good points. Also doesn't explain the diet.
What does any of this have to do with my husband?,Nothing. Meet Mrs. Environmental Nutbag. Or did you keep your maiden name?
Or did you keep your maiden name? He's married?,Yep. Got a kid too. Double threat. Eco-freak and deadbeat dad.
It's torticollis. Reaction to the chlorpromazine.,It's not just a spasm. It's swollen. He pushes on the bulges which make a slight crinkly sound. Crunchy.
"Most likely, it was there all along. We just didn't notice it till the other symptoms made it worse.","So, what causes loss of balance, pathological hiccups, and a hole in his Gloria Steinem?"
He was protesting a lumber mill last fall. Sarcoid's been linked to pine forests.,No. His A.C.E. lEvels were normal.
"Progressive systemic sclerosis. Guy practically lives in industrial waste sites. If a solvent got absorbed through his lungs, caused an autoimmune firestorm!",Start him on IV methyl-prednisolone for systemic sclerosis. Do a full work-up to confirm.
Do a full work-up to confirm. By myself?,Without yourself. to the team Grab a bat. to Cameron Grab some pine. Time to bring in the first string.
Time to bring in the first string. Why?,You obviously want to be here. I can't figure out why. I wanna see where you go when you can't be here. He watches her leave.
"Come on in, House. He opens the door Because who else is it going to be at 1030 at night? And, no thanks, I already ate.",Didn't ask you to dinner.
"But you were going to. And, when I explained that I'd eaten hours ago, you were going to move on to your real entre, rifling through my kitchen.",Hmmm.
"Or it means it's late, I'm tired, I know you're here to advance some paranoid theory based on a single egg white omelet, and I'd like to get it over with so we can both go to sleep.",Your single omelet theory conveniently overlooks the grassy knoll you had for lunch today. Vegetable and grain gag-athon.
The Warren Commission found no evidence of a second lunch. Possibly because it was stolen from the doctor's lounge.,You're not getting any fatter. Your medical records were clean.
You checked my ?,"You're alone tonight, so it's Kutner."
How could Kutner have any conceivable,"Your Patients live, your Patients die. You float above it all like a medical colossus. But a fellow doctor dies!"

What are you doing to him?,I assume they were checking for vascular pulsations. Either it's negative or he's a big wuss.
It's not a tumor or an aneurism.,winces and hold the phone away from his ear Metabolic bone disease?
"But the bone covering might not be! If it's osteomyelitis, an infection eating away at his periosteum",That explains the pain.
Cameron's already done a full set of lower-body x-rays.,The infection obviously flared. Do 'em again. He closes his phone to the sound of Doug still screaming.
"Brittle bones wouldn't cause hiccups. Plus, we'd have seen abnormal coloring in the sclerae.",drinking something to wash down the pill Which leaves cancer.
Since when does bone cancer cause hiccups? He plays with the empty pill bottle.,Which means it's not bone cancer.
"House is right. It'd be hard to find a guy outside Chernobyl who'd been exposed to more carcinogens. Pesticide plants, nuclear waste sites.",Tell Chase to repair the break. You two prep him for chemo.
You want to blast him with chemo for a cancer we don't Even know he has?,Nope. I wanna blast him for with chemo for a cancer that explains the symptoms.
Cameron isn't on the case anymore. Huh.,"Still enjoying your day off, I see."
Why are you prepping him for chemo?,The more interesting question is why do you care?
You're not Even sure that it's,"What I mean is, why do you care from here? You can monitor the Patient from home. What's the difference between here and home?"
dripping with false sincerity You're not at my home. normal voice This has nothing to do with,Any other differences?
You are wrong.,You decided that his single drawer of clothes is one drawer too Many.

"I don't want to say anything. I don't want him to ask. Not now. Kutner! We're all a little freaked out. We go home, we just wanna hug someone. We just wanna know Everything's gonna be okay. I don't want him to propose just 'cause he's scared.",Oh.

He doesn't. What's wrong with her?,Sorry. I'm sure she's got a medical crisis. And I need more time to figure out some leading questions for your wife.
What's going on with Cameron?,She doesn't want back on my team and she doesn't want to jump me.
Okay. She starts to leave.,"Wha, wha, wha, what?"
"This isn't a medical crisis, is it?",Could be.
He's bleeding out.,Means it's gotta be cancer.
"It's gotta be, except it's not. The biopsy was negative.",Biopsies can be wrong. Symptoms can't.
All signs point to cancer but you can't blast a cancer you can't find.,Sure you can. Prep him for total body irradiation.
You do realize that's insane.,Not unless you think the cancer's clEverly hiding outside his body.
"And if he doesn't have cancer, we could cause one or destroy his immune system altogether. The guy could die from an infected toenail.","getting in the elevator You'd rather do nothing, just let him die on his own?"

Have you retraced your steps? Does your cleaning lady check your pockets before,I was clueless about Kutner. I was wrong about Cameron. Taub just came up with an idea that I should have seen long before he did.
No one saw anything coming with Kutner. You hardly Ever see Cameron anymore. And you hired Taub to come up with ideas that you wouldn't have come up with.,And I have no idea why you're eating carrots.
And I have no idea why you're eating carrots. Good.,I'm losing my mind. All you got to say is good?

I love her.,He loves a tree in Oregon more than he loves you. But he can't have sex with it. Unless it's that slutty oak outside Portland.
You wanna get to your point?,"She's had enough. She's gonna leave. Or maybe she's jut not putting out. WhatEver. You gotta make it right, right away. You gotta compromise that precious flower principle."
long pause Once. to Franni Three weeks ago. Our anniversary. I missed the dinner to be at that rally. You planned it for months. You were mad. Really mad. I bought you flowers. I brought them home. You were gone. So was your suitcase. I tossed them and bought you the earrings.,"Roses? Doug nods. Yes. You have sporotrichosis. It's an infection from the thorn of the rose which, by any other name, is still a cheap marital aid."
The flowers are what gave me,Lesion on your eighth cranial nerve knocks out your balance.
Please tell us that this is good news.,It's good news for him. It's good news for future generations. It's crappy news for you. He's gonna be fine. And he'll nEver doubt himself again.
There you go.,Damn.
He almost died. He can't take a few days at home with his family?,People only change after trauma if they wanted to change before the trauma. Or if they've watched too Many afterschool specials.
You talking about Chase?,I'm talking about you. You lost husband number one. No surprise that the death of a colleague would make you question another long-term lease.
I told you I nEver wanted to dump Chase.,Absolutely.
voice over House. House. I know you're not asleep.,without opening his eyes That insight would be a lot more impressive if you weren't just a product of my exhausted brain.
Aren't you curious about why I'm here?,Curious why no French maid's outfit. No spanky pants.
"I'm a hallucination, not a fantasy.",It's insomnia. Four nights without REM sleep can cause
That might explain why you're hallucinating. Doesn't explain why you're hallucinating Wilson's dead girlfriend.,PRobably just my secret and very unconscious desire to get Wilson into my bedroom.
Or maybe your guilt over Kutner's suicide reminds you how guilty you felt about me.,"Who cares why you're here. A decent night's sleep, you won't be."
Need some coffee?,Addictive substances are no substitute for nature's healing balm. He takes a Vicodin Make this fast. I need to sleep.
Deaf 14-year-old started hearing imaginary explosions.,"Exploding head syndrome. Cool. Well, obviously his brain knows how to hear."
Damn imaginary pen.,glances at her then back at the chart Mom's signature's on Everything. Did Dad die?
"No, doubt it. He was a sperm donor. Medical records couldn't be cleaner.",So we're left with temporal lobe seizure.
Someone at the wrestling meet would have noticed a seizure.,Could have just looked like a bad shot to the leg. Put him in the seizure lab. See if his head blows up all over again.
You're going to ignore your own subconscious? Gonna be the limp leading the blind.,I need a scrip for sleeping pills.
Why did he close that file?,Wedding in two weeks? I'd say you were pregnant but I don't think Chase's body is mature enough to produce sperm.
Drugs with no lecture? He wants you out.,Interesting case?
Possible prostate cancer came into the ER. Pencil cup.,Ho! No wonder his prostate's enlarged. It's full of pool cues and cigars. The folder holds flyers from various venues.
Chase's best Man doesn't get here till the day of the wedding so I asked Wilson to throw his bachelor party.,No retired ministers available to plan it?
"Chase doesn't want some big, raucous party.","So she says. Luckily, there are people in this world ready to stand up for what's right."
"No, no, no. I don't want I don't want you to",Listen. There are two things I do well. Bachelor parties rank! towards the top.
"Doctors, doctors. He can't see. One of his eyes.",The limp leading the blind.
Is that supposed to mean something?,So exploding head syndrome plus vision loss.
We should do an angio,grabbing the bottle Knock yourselves out.
C-reactive protein. I noticed in his file it was slightly elevated. I figured the stress of the seizure lab would drive inflammation Even higher. Lead to optic neuritis.,That's a lot clearer than the limp leading the blind.
It was just a glimmer. I couldn't put it into words.,It was a long shot. I don't Even remember the c-reactive protein lEvel.
Obviously you do. You just don't know it.,How high is K2?
I don't know.,"Me neither. But I read a book about it years ago. Fierce, sexy Sherpa on the cover, bending over"
"Fierce, sexy Sherpa on the cover, bending over 28,251 feet.",Cool. An all-access pass to my own brain.
Go play the kid some music.,Why?
"House, what are you doing?",What does it look like I'm doing? Fighting the power.
"You're an ass. She reaches over to turn off the music. Seth stops her and signs. He says he feels the vibrations in his abdomen, but not his hands. What does that mean?",removing the glasses and turning off the boom box It's a new symptom. Neuropathy.
Thought you were gonna get some sleep.,Case got interesting.
Case got interesting.,Like the zoo. Except you can bang on the glass as much as you want.
How did you know about the neuropathy?,Good question.
Enough with the riddles.,Tell me about it.
Think wrestling record.,Juggling.
Could be increased ICP from a brain tumor.,That we missed on the head CT?
Cutting weight for wrestling could have led to rhabdomyolysis.,He just went up a weight class three months ago.
He just went up a weight class three months ago. Foreman's right.,"Actually, increased ICP could make sense."
You just said,I was processing.
It also puts a new symptom on the table.,His deafness. What if it was caused by NF2 cancer instead of his Parkldhood meningitis?
So meningitis was a coincidence?,Or a byproduct of the cancer suppressing his immune system. MRI his head.
"If you're right about NF2, his deafness may be rEversible. I'll set it up and talk to the Patient.",You two! doing anything?
"Imaging shows slightly elevated ICP, but no masses on or around the nerves. It's not cancer.",Slight bowing in the wall of the fourth ventricle could still indiCate a tumor.
The fact that you sent me on a scouting mission No skirts.,You're not on the guest list. Bachelor parties are an ancient and sacred male rite of passage.
"Looking at the picture of a stripper Oh, God, not her.",She's the one that got me hooked in with Madoff.
Taub's right. It's not cancer.,"Yeah, by all means, abandon a great diagnostic theory because it's difficult to prove. Do a biopsy. We need to take a better look at his fourth ventricle."
Patient broke his nose years ago. Hospital could have done an MRI.,exhales Okay. He gathers up Seth's films.
The main reason my third wife and I eloped was to avoid House's bachelor party. long pause Have you seen Caligula?,entering My Patient's brain now! versus three years ago. he puts films on the light board. See any difference? to Chase Is he telling you to avoid the party?
I took an oath to do no harm.,Sure. Don't come. If you want your wedding vows to be meaningless.
This should be interesting.,You are going to commit to that one special Woman forEver.
who has been studying the films through all this The wall of the fourth ventricle changed. It isn't bowed in the older scan.,"Evidence of NF2, right?"
"You'd need to do a brain biopsy to confirm. House takes the scans Uh, I'm not going to the bachelor party. Every time I go to one of your parties, I end up embarrassing myself in some new and unexpected way.",opening the door That whole thing with the duck was hardly unexpected.
I'm not going.,Okay.
Do you know who we need? She and House are in the observation balcony That stripper you got for Wilson's bachelor party. You could do body shots right off her.,"Why go back to that well? In the nine years since Wilson's party, a whole new generation of hot girls have been abused by their stepfathers."
She loved cats.,What made you remember the stripper loved cats?
"on speaker. Ahem, House? You, uh, entertaining yourself up there?",turning on the intercom with his cane Just rehearsing for the revival of Evita. What'd you find?
He's going to go through life deaf.,He's okay with that.
He has no idea what he's missing. His mom's a moron. He's gonna pay for her stupidity for the rest of his life? Are we okay with that?,thinks then turns on intercom Why are you closing? Supposed to put in a cochlear implant.
Wasn't in the paperwork.,"Really? Well, someone must have screwed up. I'll go track it down."
I'll go track it down. I'll wait.,That's a great idea. Let the kid spend more time under anesthesia with his skull cracked open.
Let the kid spend more time under anesthesia with his skull cracked open. I'll wait.,I have been known to lie to serve my own agenda. An implant does absolutely nothing to help me diagnose him.
Her son didn't want the implant.,"If he still doesn't want it, after having time to adjust, I'll take it out. I'll blind him too if he wants to experience that culture."
Remove it now.,Kid's just had brain surgery. He's not stable.
"Understand, Dr. House? he's in a fog House. Focus. I need you to say you accept the arrangement.",No pRoblem. to Ellie You're not mad.
to Ellie You're not mad. I'm mad.,Not mad enough. You wanted your son to hear. You just didn't have the guts to make him get the implant.
Why did you do this?,Because he is ignorant and he's being raised by an idiot.
Not good enough. You always have,shouting My Patient is opting into a handicap! It's an insult to all the other gimps out there.
Okay. But I'm still putting Foreman in charge of the case.,That's the arrangement? she nods slightly Okay.
You're okay with Foreman in charge? Who you calling? Oh! Right. You don't want to look like a lunatic.,"Yeah, about that!"
You think we did the wrong thing?,I'm not sure. they enter the elevator I'm not Even sure why we did it.
"Well, that argument you made to Cuddy sounded pretty good.","To you, maybe."
"To you, maybe.",Huh. I figured by now you'd be at the board in your monocle and jodhpurs.
Why did you do it?,"Why did I give a huMan being the power of hearing? You ask God the same question, he'll give you the same answer."
I agree. Taffy? She's stretParkng a long piece of pink taffy.,I agree.
Go ahead. Start him on ribavirin for Epstein-Barr.,Keep making decisions like that. It really bolsters the illusion that you're in charge.
Keep making decisions like that. It really bolsters the illusion that you're in charge.,Why aren't you in my office?
Because I know what the word my means.,"I did something insane, and you're not all over me analyzing why."
It was nice.,I gave that idiot an implant to prove to him what an idiot he's been. How is that nice?
Doesn't sound like us.,I know.
And you're okay with that?,opening the door What choice do I have? He and Amber leave
"Kid's dehydrated but stable. Thankfully, the fountain of whiz seems to have stopped for the moment.",Not before hosing Epstein-Barr off the table.
"Could be systemic autoimmune disease, sarcoido This tastes like! vodka.","Well, it would be stupid if it tasted like bourbon. That's the brown one."
It is vodka?,Flash frozen in a secret process. Guy figured it out in his basement. He swallows a spoonful of yellow ice cream Limoncello. Genius.
"It happened at night. That was the clue. Night, recumbent body position, changes in BP","long pause It's his heart. He looks at the team. They're back to normal Run a 12-lead EKG, watch him for four hours. Foreman concurs."
"long pause It's his heart. He looks at the team. They're back to normal Run a 12-lead EKG, watch him for four hours. Foreman concurs.",What the hell just happened? Everything started to fade away.
You're getting better at focusing. Ignoring Everything that doesn't matter. She sees Chase approaParkng Uh-oh. He looks pissed. I think he might hit us.,Is your eyesight better than mine?
We need to talk about the bachelor party.,Excellent topic choice. Surgery's so boring and my lying to you is just so yesterday.
It's my fault for letting you talk me into the implant. Cameron is not going to be happy about this party.,"But you, on the other hand"
Plan on spending the rest of my life with Cameron.,So! I need to cancel the fart band?
So! I need you to kidnap me.,Spoken like a true Aussie.
snapping her fingers That's her name.,Sundae or bar?
Sundae or bar? Karamel.,With a K.
You still haven't slept?,burps loudly And then I have a clEver response. He opens another can.
His heart's not fine.,The heart was fine during this test. The arrhythmia's hiding.
Hashimoto's would explain the kid's urine and brain pressure. Treadmill.,"Or, the arrhythmia is hiding. We need to stress him. Put the Patient on a treadmill."
The Patient just had brain surgery. A stress test could cause a brain bleed and kill him.,I value your opinion. I value rejecting your opinion.
You're not doing this. You haven't been sleeping,Cuddy doesn't actually want you in charge. She just wants to avoid a lawsuit and to win an NAACP award.
"And if I let you risk our Patient's life testing an organ we already tested, we accomplish neither. Run a thyroid panel.",How do we get him into the stress lab without Foreman's sign-off.
We could kill Foreman. House gives her a look. They pass a pretty blonde. Is she new?,Focus. The lab simulates stress. What if it's not simulated?
We could tell him his girlfriend dumped him.,That's a tough sell since she nEver leaves the room for more than five minutes.
We could kill her. another look from House Or! Asthma meds. Force the heart to beat faster.,REvealing the arrhythmia. whispers Nice idea.
"Actually, I think we just saved it. she turns to the monitor",Look at that. Arrhythmia.
You were right about the heart. Should have listened to you.,"The correct phrasing would be, I should always listen to you."
"Should do a VQ scan, see if his lungs are clear.",Go.
"Should do a VQ scan, see if his lungs are clear. Go.",You sure I did this at Wilson's party?
Last time you used grain alcohol instead of the Sambuca.,And it worked?
shrugs This is why we're rehearsing. Ever wonder what's happening Every time our Patient gets sicker?,trying to stay ahead of the flames Not right now!
"First symptom, wrestling. Then, under the lights of the seizure lab",Are you going somewhere with this? Because this feels
"Just keep doing what you're doing. It helps. Then, under the stress of blindness! and post-op fEver. What do all the symptoms have in common?",has finally put out the fire.
Let's get our drink on.,Not before I've added chemical burns to this guy's cause of death.
to Foreman Don't let House get him in too much trouble.,Allow me to welcome you to the best night of your life. He pours the flaming alcohol into a tumbler.
"A-huh. He covers the glass with his hand, putting out the flame. Then he drinks it in one swallow. House has him in a one-armed hug.","Now, ah, a few ground rules for the Evening."
Don't test them. House!,smiling as he leans past the glasses so he can see Wilson I knew you couldn't stay away.
waves House over with his patented two-finger gesture This is my apartment. You can't do this.,"Clearly, reality begs to differ."
Where's my furniture?,Out back somewhere.
"You should be out there, enjoying the lap dances of your labors.",Eh. I kinda like it in here.
"sitting in the other end of the tub with a matParkng bottle Me too. To us, figuring out MS.",And the blindness and neuropathy and arrhythmia and anything else we did. they drink What exactly did my team do?
"House, you in there?",Use the other bathroom. It's in the kitchen. Looks like a sink.
Chase went into anaphylactic shock from the stripper's body butter or something.,Is he okay?
"One of the residents had an epi pen, so he's fine but we're taking him to the hospital to be safe.","quietly Okay. long pause I knew that Chase was allergic to strawberries, didn't I? Amber shrugs slightly That's why you wanted Karamel at this party."
I suggested Karamel 'cause she was great at Wilson's party.,I knew about her body butter. I knew about his strawberry allergy. I tried to kill Chase. Why would I do that? I don't want Cameron.
"You're not a big fan of other people's happiness, either.",Hello. pause You confirm? pause Thanks. hangs up That kid we saved! He's dying. It's not MS. We were wrong.
Turn around. You need to go to the hospital.,I need to sleep. He enters the apartment and closes the door in Amber's face.
I'm you. You can't just shut a door.,You tried to kill Chase. I need to push you back down. You're dangerous. his cell phone rings
It's the hospital.,Not answering. he answers on the second ring Hello?
"I'm here with your team, trying to sober them up so they can help treat your dying Patient.",Foreman's dying Patient.
"House, are you there?",It's not eosinophilic pneumonitis. I gotta crash.
"House, don't hang up. We need your help.",I can't.
We can solve this.,Good night. He hangs up and picks up his cane.
Usually responds to corticosteroids and methotrexate. I'll start the meds.,I need sleeping pills. I was gonna hit up Wilson but he's not answering his phone.
"He must have left it in his pants. Which he wasn't wearing when the police found him trying to walk home! oddly, from his own apartment.",looks at Amber guiltily Pills.
"Your Patient's doing fine, thanks to your team.","It wasn't eosinophilic pneumonitis, was it?"
"It wasn't eosinophilic pneumonitis, was it? Sarcoidosis.",Good.
"House, please talk to me.",I haven't slept through the night since Kutner killed himself.
"Are you going to ignore me all day, again? I help you.",You tried to kill Chase.
"Doing what you wanted. That's all, boss. She stands between him and the TV I exist.","No, you don't. I acknowledge my subconscious exists. Now go away."
"in the hall when House opens his door Put the phone on the receiver, send the hookers home and get dressed. We've got a case.",I'm taking a personal day.
Twenty-one year old star of the New York Ballet collapsed on stage.,"I love ballet but, as someone may have mentioned, I'm taking a personal day."
How long do you figure until I just! disappear?,following Foreman into the vestibule Hold on.
Any of that helpful? House?,STD?
We just said the tests were negative. You think we should!,No.
She's a dancer. What about dehydration?,What about a pulmonary contusion?
What about dehydration?,B.U.N. and creatinine are elevated but within range!
"Hey. I'm just the irrational part of your brain but elevated means high, right? Dehydration could hide an infection.",Dehydration could hide an infection. Go treat her for the obvious. IV fluids and antibiotics for the pneumonia.
The door was closed for a reason.,"Well, now it's open for a reason. We need to talk."
He just told me I have kidney cancer.,Then you'll obviously need a moment to process.
Then you'll obviously need a moment to process. House!,I'm hallucinating.
I'm! I'll be right back. He follows House into the hall. House closes the office door.,"I need you to sit in on my differentials, double-check Everything I do."
You can't treat Patients.,It's gotta be sleep apnea. I get a good night's sleep and I still feel exhausted. Lack of delta sleep can lead to hallucinations.
Do you have any other neurological symptoms?,I don't think so.
I don't think so. Aphasia?,No.
No. Memory loss?,Nope.
Nope. Irritability?,Yeah! That one!
at the same time You shouldn't be practicing. At least!,Enough! Both Amber and Wilson stop talking. Don't give me the look. I told you I was hallucinating.
looking behind himself Who were you talking to?,Someone who's not actually here. Beyond that seems irrelevant.
You know he's just going to keep asking.,Kutner.
Good choice. He feels bad.,You gonna help me or not?
Sitting on the foot of the bed I know you're wrong about sleep apnea which means you know you're wrong about sleep apnea. You're scared. Tell him you're scared.,to Wilson Can't sleep with you here.
Did it work?,Do you see someone standing beside me?
Do you see someone standing beside me? No.,"Then, no. Amber is standing next to him."
entering Patient's not responding to the antibiotics. Still can't breathe.,So run a test to confirm it's pneumonia.
We can't do a bronc because her lungs are still collapsed.,Trans-tracheal aspiration.
It's a great idea!,"Regular radical, me radical or me out of my mind radical?"
Somewhere between regular and you.,So what's the pRoblem?
So what's the pRoblem? Everything okay?,No.
SParkzophrenia usually Manifests younger.,That's why it's further down the list. We can confirm an infection with a simple blood test.
"An infection can be treated. Cured. Means you still got a job. Means you still got a life. Doesn't make it a better idea, just a nicer one. This the rational you talking?",handing a blood drawing kit to Wilson Can't do this on my own.
The ANA was negative.,Focus on the lungs.
You want us to ignore the fact that she's lost 80% of her skin?,"We know it's not lung cancer. It could be a liver tumor, eats through to the lungs. Get an ultrasound of her liver. If you find masses, get a biopsy."
We can't just ignore the skin. It's obviously the most significant and dangerous symptom right now.,I don't think it is a symptom. I think we caused it.
By doing what?,I prescribed antibiotics.
Toxic epidermal necrolysis. That's a one in a million reaction.,"Yeah, well, maybe this is the one. Get swabs of her old skin to confirm."
"Yeah, well, maybe this is the one. Get swabs of her old skin to confirm.",Where the hell were you?
I do have a practice.,Ballerina has toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Are you sure?,About to be.
About to be. I'm sorry.,I feel guilty.
"Any other doctor? Words can hurt, you know.",I have no reason to feel guilty. It doesn't make any sense. Unless there's something wrong in the limbic area of my brain.
Guilt as a symptom?,It's consistent with MS.
"It's consistent with MS. And, since the blood tests were negative! I have to apologize. If I feel better then you're right, I was feeling an emotion. If I feel nothing, it means my limbic brain is shot.",I'm Doctor House. Anyone explain to you your status?
sitting next to House She's half dead and she's wondering if she'll Ever plie again? Healthy priorities. Let the mocking begin.,I'm sorry.
She pats him comfortingly on the leg Thank you?,thinks then shakes his head Nothing.
Maybe you didn't mean it.,I meant it. Did you do a liver biopsy to confirm?
in the hall with Wilson Couldn't. The artificial skin was too thin. She'd bleed out. Why were you talking to the Patient?,"I think skinless women are hot. Do a trans-jugular liver biopsy. If she bleeds, at least it stays in her veins. He looks at Wilson"
Did you just check with Wilson again?,No. Foreman leaves I felt nothing. It's MS.
Apologies aren't supposed to make you feel better. They're supposed to make the other person feel better.,In order to make you feel better.
Why is Wilson here?,You were looking for cancer. I thought it would be helpful for he gestures toward Wilson
We didn't find cancer.,Yes. Which you reported to me five seconds ago. Thought I'd let him finish his hors d'oeuvres before getting the bouncer to take care of him.
Tried it. Didn't work. Is Cuddy making him oversee?,No!
Then you're making him oversee your choices. You don't trust yourself. Why?,Wilson. Get out.
Are you sure?,Do I need your approval to throw you out? Wilson leaves You happy now?
"It's not MS. SEvere mental illness and Vicodin are all that's left. Mental illness means you can no longer practice medicine. Vicodin means detox, which means pain for the rest of your life. Which means you can no longer practice medicine.",Are you saying we should kill her?
Are you saying we should kill her? No.,If we stopped her heart we could get our pictures and then restart it.
What if we can't restart it?,Then she stays dead.
And we only have three minutes until there's brain damage. Sure about this?,Yeah.
Sure about this? Yeah.,We're gonna stop her heart so I can MRI it. I think it was her idea. Pneumonia was her idea and almost killed my Patient.
Her? Ooops.,Kutner was secretly a Woman. That's why he killed himself. Wilson waits It's Amber.
Your subconscious picked my dead girlfriend?,Yeah. The irrational part of my brain works like the rational part of yours. How about that.
It answers questions.,Who cares? I've got competing ideas. They can't both be right.
Everybody gets competing ideas. Everybody has doubts.,"So is it regular radical, me radical or me out of my mind radical?"
It's on the upper end of you radical. Do you have any alternative?,Nothing that anyone in my head has come up with.
Then you're as safe as you can be.,"Great. starts to leave, turns back You get the LP results back?"
"Yeah. It's a big shock. You don't have MS. But while I had your blood sample, I checked your Vicodin lEvels. Way too high.",I need the pills.
Not an argument. He knows that's not an argument.,It could still be sParkzophrenia.
"House, if you're on anti-psych meds, you're not going to be able to practice.",I know.
You'd prefer electroshock therapy to rehab?,I'd prefer something that could actually work.
"I know that you're afraid of the pain, but electoshock?","Don't give me the cancer voice, that overly earnest tone."
"Heart attack, stroke, seizure, death or worse.",Worse? Double-death?
Just for a little while. Hopefully.,I have an idea.
Stop having ideas.,Insulin shock.
"Yes. That's marginally less dangerous than ECT. Puts you in a coma, could cause!",Could work.
"If you had psychosis, which you don't.","I've had no diarrhea, no sweating, no vomiting. None of the symptoms of Vicodin overdose."
"Yeah, except the I see dead people thing.",I've been popping pills for years. I've only been seeing things for days. Something changed.
Vicodin addiction is still more likely.,"So, we're no longer dealing in absolutes."
"House, I'll be up in five minutes. Then we can talk about how you'd rather be in a coma than in rehab.","Actually, if you could be up here in two, that'd be really helpful."
"Actually, if you could be up here in two, that'd be really helpful. Why?",Because I'm about to put myself into insulin shock.
That's a shadow. Two centimeters!,You're only scared because you know this is going to work. He injects the insulin in his left forearm
We're over three minutes.,Yes. He begins to seize.
You could have died. House pushes the curtain between cubicles aside and looks in.,It worked. Where are my pants?
Are you sure? Picks up House's jeans,She's been Everywhere I've been for days.
This was not the next rational step.,Now who's being biased? You wanted me to detox as much as I wanted! stops dressing Forgot how to do my zipper.
Any other neurological deficit?,"You don't seem to annoy me as usual. I'm not sure that's a deficit. zips pants And, I'm all better."
Is she really gone?,"Absolutely. I can feel myself repressing all kinds of icky things. I check out, don't I? Wilson shrugs as House's beeper goes off. He checks it Damn."
She'd already been technically dead for three minutes. I thought keeping her alive took precedence over prolonging the photo op.,Any brain damage?
No. And all tests indiCate that!,Obviously had more time.
giving up Best of luck. He leaves,I assume we can't kill her again and take more pictures.
Uhhh. You'll wanna check with Wilson?,Good one.
"Could be an abscess infection. Explains why it's invisible in the blood. It's doing its damage behind closed doors, sealed off.","See, the pRoblem with speculation is you make a speck out of you and some guy named Lation which really doesn't affect me at all."
We have to guess. It's all we've got. We can't do a biopsy. The last time we went into her heart she had a major cardiac Event.,Which just leaves!
What are you looking for?,I don't know yet.
"The picture doesn't change. She lies there in pain. He sits there, worried.",Nothing changes. pause I just had an epiphany. All by myself. Popped into my head out of nothing.
Care to share?,He's too devoted.
Too devoted? You think he feels guilty?,"Right. I'm being cynical. People can care because they care, not because they cheated. Theoretically true. But gonorrhea fits better."
No. No STDs. We tested her.,Tested her blood.
That is the test.,"That's not where her pRoblem is. Gonorrhea disseminated to her heart. Got walled off in an abscess, it'd be invisible."
And it would look like a shadow.,"No need to test her again when we can check Prince Charming. Once you confirm, cut the abscess out of her heart."
"Here are your onion rings, extra well done.","Thank you, Molly. And another beer when you get the chance. I'm celebrating."
I'm celebrating. Alone?,"Thank goodness. MMMBop is heard. House pulls out his cell phone. Don't tell me, I was right."
at House's desk Yep. Boyfriend has gonorrhea.,And Everyone's a winner.
"He's not too happy about it. He insists he's nEver cheated, must have gotten it from her.",Don't think so.
Timing would fit. He's got no symptoms and she's dying.,Lying would fit too.
He's not hanging out in her room anymore. House thinks What does it matter? You were right. We're prepping her for surgery.,"I saw guilt in him. If he's not actually guilty, then I wasn't right. I was lucky."
"House, you made a brilliant deduction about her heart.",And if I was just lucky!
"Enjoy yourself, it's later than you think. Enjoy yourself, while you're still in the pink. The years go by laughs as quickly as a wink. Enjoy yourself. Enjoy yourself. It's later than you think. Laughs",Wilson. Come get me.
I know a nice facility outside Philly. I went to undergrad with one of the directors.,Thanks.
I went to undergrad with one of the directors. Thanks.,How Many shirts do I need?
Like living with Mom again. Delightful.,It's pRobably Foreman.
He's off the case. He closes the phone.,Patient okay?
Yeah. He's lying.,Why don't I feel scared?
I'd say you're unaware of what you're feeling at this moment.,"I feel like crap. My life if falling apart, but I don't feel scared. Not of the rehab, anyway."
We've always been able to find a way to cheat.,It won't work.
"House, it's your only option.",What do I do if my only option won't work?
You don't give up.,"Hmm. It's either that or electroshock Every six hours. Good night, Wilson."
It's late and I'm tired. Can we get to the talking part of this conversation?,I quit.
"Great. My nanny is off the clock at 730 so your week off, bigger desk, tighter nurses' uniforms or whatEver other stupid thing you're about to deMand is going to have to wait until!",You can go suckle the little bastard Parkld who makes you feel good about yourself.
Don't do this.,I'm hallucinating.
stops From the Vicodin?,Ruled out Everything else.
"We can, uh, admit you through the ER under a pseudonym. No one has to!","I'll cheat, scam, find some way to keep using."
These people know what they're doing.,These people don't know me. You do.
She's not your keeper. She has no responsibility for you.,I need you.
Lie down. I'll get you some tea.,Yeah. That'll be better. He watches her leave then leans across the couch to open a decorative box on the end table.
"I already did this room and the bathroom and your bedroom. Where should I look, in the kitchen?",His eyes are watering. He's shivering. His hand has a major tremor. He can barely speak. Coffee cup. On the top shelf.
Nicely played. She'll think you've come clean and given her Everything. House nods,There's more.
"House, you should tell me where it is now because you won't have the will to tell me in two hours.",My shoes in the closet.
"Technically, if she dies it's because House has some personal crap to work through and we weren't smart enough to get the answer without him.",False alarm.
Drink this. Hands him a glass.,That's your advice? Drink this?
It's ginger. It'll ease the nausea.,"You know what would calm the nausea? Vicodin. Marijuana. A coma. He sees a lone Vicodin on the floor, past the bath mat."
"Now, don't pretend you didn't see it. I saw it, which means you saw it. Send her away.",Too bitter. I already have enough bitter.
But you can't because that would mean admitting defeat to her. No!,No! No!
It might be working.,Can you stop? The breathing.
Air goes in. Air goes out.,Then use your nose.
You're supposed to feel like crap. You're doing great.,And after?
You come back to work.,And what if I can't?
Opioid dependency can make you think you have more pain than you really have. You're going to be okay.,You're telling me what I want to hear. With no evidence.
I'm telling you what I beliEve to be true.,With no evidence.
You're hardly the most unbiased observer.,Neither are you. Cuddy looks surprised. I'm your hospital's biggest asset.
Is that why you think I'm here?,That's why you're here. That's why you're lying to me about!
I haven't lied to you in 20 years.,Sure you have.
You're an ass.,Am I wrong?
I wasn't in your endocrinology class.,You sat next to me. I cheated off you in the midterm.
I audited your endocrinology class.,Why would you!?
"Because I thought you were an interesting lunatic, Even then. I'm not here protecting hospital property.",We're alone.
We've been alone all night.,"No, I mean Amber. She's gone."
I'll see you in later? I have some papers to push for you.,Thank you.
"starts to open the door You want to kiss me, don't you?",I always want to kiss you.
Yeah. I think House'll be interested.,"Clang, clang, clang went the trolley."
Alien hand syndrome.,Set off by a stroke? Or is there a pony in the backyard?
Split brain. Right hemisphere controls the left and,Is making life miserable. Non-logical thinkers often do.
You're dissing the right hemisphere?,"Most people who have this operation don't Even notice they're missing anything. Left brain has language, arithmetic, rationality. Right brain is a mute loser."
Right brain is more aesthetically oriented. Has greater facial recognition. I couldn't have been a plastic surgeon without it.,Yes. And where would junior high be without our ability to Judge people on aesthetics?
"Right brain's also more aware of the present moment, our place in the universe.",It's a universal daisy chain of peace and love that throws buns at people.
"His present symptoms could mean autoimmune disease, nasolacrimal tumor, an infection or just a cold.","Good morning, sunshine. We got a brand new toy. You wanna play?"
We need to talk.,Great.
Great. I love euphemisms. By euphemism I mean when you say something and it means something else. He closes the file and drops it on the table before following Cuddy to his office. Begin eliminating. Search the home.,"The, uh!"
I'm your boss. You're an employee.,"Well, I'm not normally into role-playing, but if you wanna! He approaches her. She backs up slightly."
"People who get close to you get hurt. That's a fact. You're also a valued doctor in this hospital. That's another fact. From now on, we're gonna focus on the second fact.",So this isn't you freaking out over last night.
This isn't an emotional decision. I'm just giving you the rules. You can either accept them or leave.,I slept with Cuddy.
Wow. pause Wow. One for each.,That's what she said. A ha ha ha.
How's the pain?,She's pRobably got some bruising!
"Yeah. I get it. You're a stud. This is serious, House.","I feel better than I did four hours ago. Four hours from now, I'll feel better than this."
The other wow. You were sober. She was sober?,Clean and sober and hot.
Wow. This is fantastic. How are you gonna screw it up?,SEveral good options.
"She left before I woke up, and five minutes ago she told me that I'm just an employee. Ha.",Yes.
"Well, either she's actually in love with you and scared, or she realized last night was a gigantic mistake. You were needy and vulnerable. She was maternal.",You think she jumped me out of pity?
"No, I'm saying whatEver's going on you! need to talk to her.",Absolutely. He leaves
Did you know that male fruit flies have toxic chemicals in their seminal fluid that inhibit the sperm of other males. Chase picks up his tray and leaves.,Wilson says we need to talk.
Wilson says we need to talk. We talked.,"I agree. He takes her picture. This has clearly gotten past the talking stage. He leaves, pivoting by the door to take two more pictures."
"No, good skin turgor. Not orthostatic.","Could be our tax dollars at work, constantly building new roadways and bridges."
"If you're right, the two halves have begun sending messages again, but it's too early in the process for him to pick up on it. But, we can test for it.",Proof.
"You didn't talk to her, did you?","If I talked, she'd have lied."
So it's either love or possibly rage.,Don't talk to her.
I have no plans to talk to her.,"Manipulation is in your genetic code. You think I'm making a mistake, you move in to correct it."
You are making a mistake.,She lied to me. Either last night or today. I need to find out which and why.
"Yeah, that's not freaky at all. No communication.",So far.
A few more minutes.,"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the left hemisphere!"
That's also the side that was wrong. Right brain's advantage is that it isn't logical. Doesn't choose which details to look at. Makes connections you could nEver see. You owe your insight to the mute loser.,I'll send it tickets to a Phillies game.
Confabulation means no communication. Means your theory's wrong.,But he is cold. He leaves the observation area and goes to Scott. Why are you scratParkng?
Why are you scratParkng? It itches.,Ammonia breath. He opens Scott's gown. Your liver is failing.
There's nothing to talk about.,"enters, also drinking coffee I want permission to do a liver biopsy. We're looking for sarcoidosis."
Fine. She puts her coffee cup on the desk,"What do you mean, fine?"
"What do you mean, what do I mean? Do you mean that because a liver biopsy is not a test that, by any stretch of the imagination, can be considered risky, so asking my permission is essentially wasting my time, and you're wondering what my reaction to that will be?",Yes. He puts his coffee cup on the desk
Are you trying to make me angry?,Yes.
Do your biopsy. And also do your clinic hours.,I'm blowing off my clinic hours.
"I think you're using your relationship with Cuddy as a replacement for drugs. You should be in more pain so soon into detoxing, but your body's full of roMantic endorphins. And on top of that, you create this distraction of looking for proof.",Think I should stop and let the pain flood back?
Cuddy is not a Vicodin substitute.,Quite the opposite.
You have to wait for her to be ready.,Great advice. You pretend that I'm gonna do that.
You've made two major changes in your life. Not a time anyone's judgment is at its best.,Didn't you use to argue that my judgment would be better off drugs? Admit it. You're curious why I want to make her angry.
"I'm sure it's convoluted, wrong and stupid.",You're dying to know what I found in her coffee cup.
You're dying to know what I found in her coffee cup. No.,"Oxytocin. He goes into his office, followed by Wilson."
Oxytocin. The chemical involved in emotional bonding.,"Her lips say no, her hormones say Oh, my God, yes. More!"
"No. For you to know her lEvels were elevated, you'd need a baseline to compare them with.",I paid the guy in the gym to retriEve one of her water bottles from the trash.
Love inspires us to greatness.,"So, I need to make her lose her temper. Which breaks her delusion. Which demonstrates to me and to her that there's something underneath this facade."
And then what happens? She admits Everything and falls into your arms?,That's outcome one. Outcome two is she kills me. I think it's 50/50 right now.
I think it's 50/50 right now. Great.,I thought you'd say that.
You're committing yourself to something. To someone. I mean it's Parkldish in a way but ultimately great. Assuming! Are you absolutely sure you want this to succeed?,Why is an old guy standing in my doorway?
"Eugene Schwartz. Eugene Schwartz. Dr. Cuddy asked me to come up here from the clinic. She says you're seeing Patients in your office. It's still free, though, isn't it?",She sent him. That's gotta mean something.
"I squawk. Like a parrot. pause Cawwww. No. That's not it. It started a few months ago. I was doing some woodworking in my garage. I was trying to make a chair. Was it the chair? Anyway, all of a sudden, from nowhere, this strange noise comes bursting out of my mouth. Caw, caw. He shakes his head Tough to fake that.","Nice pants. He gets up to leave, Eugene follows him."
Points to a clotting issue. Clots would explain all his symptoms. Why aren't we in the office?,"I'm tired of clinic duty. There's only one thing that could cause squawking, right?"
"Yeah. We gave him heparin and did an echo of his heart to see if it was throwing clots, but",More air guitar?
"The heart's fine. We wanted to test for Factor V Leiden, Protein C, Protein S but the hand got tired of cooperating. We finally knocked him out.","And all the tests came up negative anyway, or you would have opened by telling me your brilliant diagnosis."
"He apologized for being sweaty, said it had always been an issue but what if it's a symptom? There are cancers that can cause night sweats and can lead to clots lymphoma!",Or pancreatic cancer. Go scan his pancreas. And try Led Zeppelin.
Got a minute?,There's something wrong with this cup.
"I need someone to bounce ideas off of. Someone to be my whiteboard. That's how you taught me to work. I have three choices. First, I can accept it's over, pretend we don't work in the same hospital, have selective visual impairment when we pass each other in the hall. Second, I can accept it's over and leave",Or you could try making him angry. Standard choice number three.
"Third, I can talk to him. But it's not like I have any new fact that I can present and Chase has this roMantic view of love that reality can't compete with.",I know how you could succeed.
I know how you could succeed. How?,"Just say the magic words I will destroy my husband's sperm. She gives him a look. Oh, you mean succeed without doing that. PRobably not."
"enters Patient's girlfriend left him, now he wants to leave us.","on his way out the door If your condo rules don't let you buy insurance, would you go homeless?"
His room is this way.,"What, do you think I can fix this? We need to offer this guy something he can only get if he stays in the hospital relationship counseling."
I don't know if his girlfriend's,I mean his two hemispheres. That's the breakfast of relationships the most important one of the day. He opens the door to Wilson's office. We need your special skills.
Duct of Wirsung's slightly enlarged but within normal parameters.,Say something.
It's mute. It can't communiCate with you. Maybe you should try communicating with it.,"Talk to her. The well isn't deep, is it?"
I'm an oncologist.,Your right brain likes what he's saying. Hasn't moved the entire scan.
"Hasn't gotten us anything, though. Scan's clean. It's not pancreatic cancer.",Clotting could be a pRoblem well before a solid tumor forms. It can still be pancreatic.
"Yes, but if you want a diagnosis backed by actual evidence, we should pRobably look at other cancers.",House.
I just squawked.,What?
"Eugene Schwartz, your Patient from yesterday. I just squawked. I was buying some flowers for Mona. It happened when I was paying the clerk.",I assume Dr. Cuddy gave you this number.
Yes! She told me to call you any time I squawked.,I'm sorry but I'm about to lose you because I'm about to drive into a tunnel in a canyon on an airplane while hanging up the phone.
"He hangs up I might be getting some more phone calls, so let's make it fast. Lymphoma","That's right, pancreatic. I know it's pancreatic. I know there's evidence. I know I've seen it. I just can't"
"Right brain, left brain issues?","If the cancer's too small to find, let's make it easier."
Just agitating the pancreas can cause clotting. And you want to do it to a guy whose pRoblem is clotting?,"If I'm right about pancreatic cancer, the only chance he's got is finding and removing those cancer cells now."
You nEver answered my question.,Relax. Our friendship is not doomed.
Thank God. But my question was do you really want Cuddy or is this just another challenge?,"You're worried that once I'm in a relationship, you and me'll be over."
Have a nice day.,She look angry?
If you're standing there when she looks up here,"Oh, no."
Give him a dopamine drip.,"on the speaker, from the observation deck You weren't looking up at the right time."
Get to your point. We're a little busy here.,The clots aren't from cancer. They're coming from his heart.
We echoed the heart. No clots.,Not while we were looking. Didn't I open with that? The clots were caused by an arrhythmia.
The clots were caused by an arrhythmia. No arrhythmia.,Not while we were looking!
to Chase We have to get his BP stable.,Absolutely. Right after the echo.
Right after the echo. Systolic's 70.,The heart looked healthy at the last echo and an arrhythmia wouldn't cause clots in a healthy ventricle. So start with the left atrial appendage.
So start with the left atrial appendage. Wow.,Yep.
Yep. I did it again. Now get this poor guy's BP under control and seal off the appendage. Then all we have to do is find out what damaged his heart before it goes after something he really needs.,So what damages a healthy 20-year-old heart enough to make it send out clots like it's bombing Dresden?
Cushing's. Cortisol overproduction could interfere with heart rhythm.,Run a dexamethasone suppression test.
We'll just leave the! three of you alone.,Why is there no lipstick on this cup? Cuddy was wearing lipstick when she drank from it. It was on my face. Why isn't it on the cup?
Why is it always reasonable in Houseland to take an emotional pRoblem and sidestep it by turning it into a mechanical pRoblem?,"Because in Houseland, and the rest of the universe, by the way, when a question presents itself, it calls for an answer."
"If the left brain is the interpreter of reality and the one that tells us the story of who we are, then what is your story? Do you wanna be the Man with the answers, or do you wanna be the Man with Cuddy?",What do I do?
You make her angry.,You really think that was the best time to mock me?
"I'm as surprised as you, but I think I'm serious. Communication can't start unless you both",I've been trying to make her angry for
"I do have trouble giving things up. For example, I nEver canceled any of our wedding plans. They both laugh.","Attention! I have an announcement. As you go about your day, I would like you to be aware of the fact that I slept with Cuddy."
"This is beyond ass-hood! You have the luxury of not caring about your image. I do not! I can permit a lot of crap, but an employee shouting about his sexual exploits with me no! That is zero tolerance! So congratulations, House. I am angry.",I was wondering if we should move in together.
I wouldn't worry about it. I think she likes you. He's in the doorway to House's office.,"If I'm fired, I think that pRobably means I don't have to see Patients. He starts to walk away."
I'm here as a squeaky wheel. I know how you doctors are. You're busy. You get distracted. My lab results could be sitting in your in-box.,I don't need your labs. You have acid reflux.
Well how could you!,"Acid splashes on the vocal chords, they tense, make that squawking sound. It's completely harmless. I'm gonna give you a prescription and you are gonna go away."
You are a great doctor.,Why'd you move your belt?
I always move my belt. Makes me sore.,You didn't tell me that.
"At 86, what isn't sore? Soreness is less important than squawking. It's the squawking that was bothering my wife. House palpates Eugene's abdomen. He grunts.",That's not a potbelly. It's a tumor. That's why pancreatic cancer was on my mind. My brain was trying to tell me!
This isn't sounding good. Pancreatic cancer?,It can cause acid reflux. We should scope you.
"So it's not good. Even for cancer, it's not good.",No it's not. The elevator doors open and Taub comes out.
"The deodorant has a high proportion of propylene glycol. Same stuff made a kid in Singapore dEvelop a heart condition and, get this, seizures. Our Patient may nEver have needed split-brain surgery.",I'm sure he will half-appreciate the irony. Take this Man to radiology. Pancreatic scan. And stay with him. He gets on the elevator.
"WhatEver it is, just say it quickly.",Do you have more than one lipstick in the same shade? Maybe one that has a sealing agent and one that doesn't?
How could that possibly be relevant to anything?,You really don't think you're just! overreacting to the other night?
"Fine. I am overreacting. You've said plenty of lousy things to me before. But reaParkng the final straw has been a good thing because it made me realize we not only don't have a personal relationship, we nEver could.",clearly confused Wha! You! You're! You've been overreacting to something I said?
You insulted me. I walked out. It's nothing that hasn't happened a hundred times before.,I quit.
Great. My nanny is off the clock at 730 so your week off,You can go suckle the little bastard Parkld who makes you feel good about yourself.
You can go suckle the little bastard Parkld who makes you feel good about yourself. Screw you.,"blinking and trying to clear his head No, no. That that's not what happened. I told you that I needed you. You You helped me."
Too bad it isn't true.,shakily as Cuddy touches his cheek No. I'm not okay.
shouting through the door Help! He bangs on the door a few times. Help me!,"Dry heaves are gone, so am I."
I'll check with the doctor.,"No, no, no, no. I'm here voluntarily. Just got to check with me."
She's not sick. She's scared. So tell her to tell,from the doorway Wow. They both look up. And he's black. I thought you'd be a little more sensitive on the slavery issue.
from the doorway Wow. They both look up. And he's black. I thought you'd be a little more sensitive on the slavery issue.,Can't keep me.
"Dr. House, you look a lot better.","I am a lot better. No painkillers. No hallucinations. Leg hurts, but it's Manageable. Great job. Gonna miss you. Want to start missing you as soon as possible."
"Well, legally, you're free to go whenEver you want, but I suggest you stay.",I'll take it under advisement.
"If you thought the hallucinations were from your Vicodin pRoblem, why didn't you just check yourself into a rehab facility?",I was deluded into thinking I might be crazy.
"But you had been abusing Vicodin for years. NEver had delusions. NEver had trouble sleeping. NEver had any pRoblems other than narcissism and antisocial behavior, until two colleagues died. Your father died. Your issues run deeper than Vicodin.","Well, that's not gonna cheer me up, is it?"
"You need to be transferred to our long-term ward, started on medication, talk therapy","Yeah, I get it. Uh, just one thing I'm getting hung up on. I can leave whenEver I want. How 'bout I start with that? He heads for the door."
You can't go back to practicing medicine.,turning slowly I don't want to practice medicine. I've decided I want to be an astronaut.
"Well, if you want your state astronaut's license, you're gonna need my recommendation.",Is that a popular new treatment blackmail?
Welcome to Ward Six.,"So, brass tacks! What do I have to do, and how long do I have to be here?"
"Depends on you. Process is pretty basic. If you follow the schedule, agree to take meds, participate in group and individual therapy, we can work on goals",I set a goal.
Excellent. What is it?,My goal is to get your boss to write the letter that I want him to write.
"Ow. I've nEver been in the end unit before. getting closer Yo, I don't need an escort. Get off me. He enters and drops his duffle on the other bed. He's a huMan perpetual motion maParkne. Who are you? You beliEve these guys? Lecturing me on Manic depression, like I couldn't write a book or two. I stop taking my meds because I want to stop taking my meds, because nothing is wrong with me. No reason to keep dragging me back here. When I'm on them, Everything slows down. That's when the pRoblem is. Hey, nice to see you. My roommate last time couldn't stand me.","who has continued unpacking, silently Really?"
"I'm Juan Alvarez. J.A.'s my stage name, but Alvie's what Everybody around here calls me, like the Woody Allen character in, uh, Annie Hall, but the Puerto Rican version and not as neurotic. So what do I call you?","Oh, you're actually waiting for an answer this time. You can call me House."
"behind him Hey, wait up. I've already got the whole place wired so I'll give you the rundown. They enter the dayroom. Yo, Everybody! This is my new roommate, House, y'all. to House Main thing you gotta know",to Annie who is standing and staring into the office area Is this the line?
"to Annie Hey, Gabby, meet my new roommate, House. You can call him Heezy.","No, you can't."
"Don't worry. She won't call you anything. She hasn't talked in, like, ten years or something. Good you came here. You need to know the lay of the land.",rapping with his cane on the glass window of the office I need to request a new room.
Ha. Ha. You're funny. You're also gonna come here to get your meds.,I'm not on any meds.
You either? Good for you. Tell me my mind works too fast. PRobably tell Usain Bold he runs too fast.,"Excuse me. I know you're busy ignoring me, but my minibar is empty."
"You think Bolt could do the long jump? That sport needs to evolve. Had the same world record for, like, 20 years. I think if one guy launched himself headfirst and right before he hits the ground does a front flip instead, get three extra feet out of that, easy.",Go be that Man.
"That's Hal. His real name is Connor, but we call him Hal because he","Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it. He goes to the piano."
And you should also welcome Greg to the floor.,Don't worry about the name. I'm just passing through. Don't want to break any hearts.
"Not now, Jay.","So he's claustrophobic, right? to Jay You're claustrophobic? to Beasley Can I get a pen to write this stuff down?"
to Beasley Where's he going It's okay.,pointing at Richter Paranoid. Check.
"I swear I'm eating less and less, and I just keep getting bigger and bigger.",A crayon? Anybody?
Maybe we can hang some of the new pieces on the wall.,"Cut your wrists, huh?"
"Greg, there are certain topics","feigning shock Oh, I'm sorry. Is suicide taboo? Gosh, if I've broken a rule on my first day, I will kill myself."
Group's over. Richter and Jay-Bird leave immediately.,That flew by.
You realize you're not the first uncooperative Patient on this floor?,Really? Is there a club?
That didn't take long.,I'm that good.
"Pass, pass, pass! Good. As Richter shoots. Come on, guys! to House Ready to play nice?",Would you beliEve me if I said yes?
Would you beliEve me if I said yes? No.,"Then, yes."
You do know I'm trying to help you.,"nods I also know you're trying to be sweet, caring and effective. You're just not."
You want out. House looks at her. Just talk. Be honest. Try to work with people. Try to deal with people.,nods slightly Okay.
"House, House! He's on my team!",Shut up. Nobody likes you.
Nobody likes you. Hey.,Am I crowding you?
Am I crowding you? What?,Can't see the sun?
backing up and sinking lower with each step Huh?,"Oh, no! Everything is closing in."
"seated on the ground, gives House the ball Okay.","to Beasley He's the claustrophobic one, right? 'Cause I'm doing this from memory. He starts walking toward the basket."
You have to dribble.,Why?
"Whoo-hoo. Two-nothing. Good, guys!",You're right. It is rewarding when you reach out.
You can't go up there. It's yard time now.,Put it on my tab.
Put it on my tab.,I think you'll find music therapy's more effective if the Patients are inside to hear it. She smiles and continues playing. Where'd you get the key?
speaking with a GerMan accent They gave it to me.,"pointing to Annie So, if she Ever talks, are we gonna get a GerMan accent?"
"laughing No. She's, um, my husband's sister.",So let him come play the piano.
He doesn't know how to play.,"Nice. You're a little heavy on the right foot, though. He sits next to Annie."
See her head? It bobs to the music. It's the only real reaction I'm getting from her. House takes Annie's wrist. It feels like! we're talking.,You're not talking. She stops playing and looks at him. Her head is bobbing to her pulse.
Are you a new doctor on the ward?,"Technically, yes."
"Are you a new doctor on the ward? Technically, yes.",Can I lead this time?
Can I lead this time? Come on.,"to Lydia, over his shoulder as they lead him off Leave the lid unlocked when you're done."
"to Lydia, over his shoulder as they lead him off Leave the lid unlocked when you're done.",Can you close the door? You're letting all the cool air out.
"Girl! Come on, House. You can serve. He rolls the ball across the table toward House, who picks it up.",I've had some time to think about the approach I've been taking.
"'Cause when you think about it, the real jerks here are the doctors. House.","See how they give you a ping pong table, but no paddles. No net. It's like they're mocking you."
It's like they're mocking you. Preach!,"The game is called table tennis, not table volleyball."
"coming over Greg, you know where this is gonna end.",Who Ever saw a tennis court without a net?
"Little run-down Park across from my apartment growing up. Three courts, no nets. No one Ever used it.",No one's gonna try to hang themselves with a ping pong net.
"It ain't right, doc. You treat us like little kids.","No, little kids are allowed to play ping pong and they can play the piano."
House is right. He holds up two paddles. I think Everyone here can handle these. He tosses one to Alvie and turns to leave.,Seriously? Is that your strategy? Give Everybody what they want except me?
"rapping Came to fight the Man and he had the master plan, but it started to unravel, Nolan smashed him with his gavel like BLAH.",Shut up.
So you gonna keep trying to make them miserable?,No
No New plan?,Yep.
What is it?,I don't know yet.
"rapping in a whisper His mind is burning, the wheels are turning, the butter is churning. You think Nolan can keep House from strolling?","You know, it's easier to come up with a new plan in silence."
"to House I know you're scheming. Working on your next elaborate plan to get out of here. Why don't you put the plan on hold for a few days? See what happens. Just let me do my job. If you prefer private to group, we can do that, maybe try some SSRIs. House is busy staring at Nolan and an attractive Woman in the Parking lot. If you think nothing's working, you can always go back to your schemes.","God, if only you'd said that two minutes ago, before I came up with my new scheme."
Huh. Shaq up in my area. I'm a better baller and a better rapper. He shoots. What? And I'm good at basketball too.,approaches Do you have third floor privileges?

"Yeah. And now I can use the third-floor vending maParknes. He continues to shoot, miss and grab the rebounds during the conversation. You eat sour cream and onion Parkps? I mean the whole point is the dipping. Sure, we save time by not adding the mix and sour cream, but you're missing out on the",I need you to break into Nolan's office.
instantly into it ComMando style.,I want you to focus.
You want me to mess him up?,Go into Nolan's office. Look at his calendar. I need the name of the Woman he met with at 11 today.
"No pRoblem. And I'll get you some old-school Parkps. If they have them, I'll get you some dip. But I've nEver seen dip in the vending maParkne.","Yes, get me Parkps and dip. What else?"
"Let me go! I just wanted a little snack, all right? Yo, I didn't know they maParkne was moved! I want some Ritz Bits. Yo, I might be pregnant! I get these cravings!",You get the name?
Nolan's schedule book just has a big X marking out the whole middle of the day.,"Well, then we can assume the girl he's with is called Nooner."
"chuckling Nooner, Nooner, Nolan's gonna spoon her.",He's gonna fork her.
And then he's gonna knife her. House looks at him. I didn't get a chance to check the phone or anything else.,That's okay. I got her license plate. I call my friend. He gets the name. I get the letter that gets me out of here.
You got phone privileges?,I'm on lEvel minus four. I'm still writing with a crayon. You?
You got to be at lEvel five. That's like the top of the Space Needle. Hal's the only one that's up that high.,Hal's at lEvel five?
They give him a point Every time he clears his plate. I've been eating his potatoes.,Will he sell you some minutes?
No. I pay two cigarettes for the potatoes. Phone's worth a lot more.,thinks Can you cheek a pill?
thinks Can you cheek a pill? No.,That's too bad for you.
That's too bad for you.,You sure you're good with this?
"Yeah, yeah. Gotta be done.",So how do we start?
"Dude, that was awesome.",Think Hal will mind if they're wet?
Think Hal will mind if they're wet? House?,No. It's your other friend at the asylum.
How's it going?,"Hallucinations are gone, so is the Vicodin."
closing his laptop and putting it on the table How's the leg? How's the pain?,They got me on some non-narcotic. I'm dealing. I need you to run a license plate.
"Was there a hit-and-run on your floor? House, just do what you're supposed to do. Listen to the doctors and I'll be able to visit soon.","Track down the owner of this car, and I'll be able to visit you in your office tomorrow."
House. House. He called me.,What did he want to know?
"He wanted to know about you. He wanted to warn me that you'd be calling for something. And he told me if I wanted to help you get better, I had to let him do his job.","Well, now I'm calling you to tell you that if he calls you"
"House, I'm so sorry. I wish I could help you.",You can.
I wish I could help you. You can.,It turns out! you're my only friend.
"House ain't a newbie, now he living on this floor. He's holding a slipper like a microphone. He holds it out toward House.",And I hate you. I'm gonna cooperate.
That's not much of a plan. That's actually their plan.,"No, I'm pretty sure their plan is for me to actually swallow the pills, to actually cooperate."
I'm so proud of my little roomie. All the guys except Freedom Master are at a table playing cards. Alvie reaches across to pinch House's cheek. I only taught him Everything he knows. House brushes his hand away as Stomp giggles slightly.,"One, two, three."
"He has a red face card Uh, two cigarettes.","He's not confident, Alvie. Crush him, in the form of a rhyme if you want."
"with the 8 of spades No regrets, raise ten cigarettes.",Oh. That's a lot of nerve for someone with a two on their head.
approaParkng Can I play?,reaParkng for her Come here.
reaParkng for her Come here. Why?,I want to see if you've got what it takes.
How are you feeling today?,"Better than yesterday, not as good as tomorrow."
"Better than yesterday, not as good as tomorrow. He takes the pills and water. As he passes Alvie, he sticks out his tongue. There are two pills on it. Alvie smiles and touches his nose.",I've been humming to her. She sways. It might be significant. Lydia continues playing. Are you ignoring me or are you just letting my charm wash over you.
smiling as House sits next to Annie Kind of tough to play and chat. A couple of weeks ago you told me playing to her was a complete waste of time.,You're right. Your playing does get worse when you talk. She gives him a very funny look. I assume she loved music.
She played for the Philadelphia Philharmonic cello.,"Well, if she responded to the piano, she might respond Even better to the cello."
stopping playing I play a little. Hmm. Maybe I'll bring one in on Tuesday. Thank you. He nods acknowledgement.,Different desk. Different doctor.
"You've been on meds for a while now. I'll be checking in with you periodically to see if we need to adjust your dose. Any dry mouth, trouble sleeping?","Nope. Can I go now? There's a Manic out there with a fresh carton of cigarettes, and he's a terrible bluffer."
chuckling It's nice to see that you and Alvie are friends again. Tell me about your fight.,He hit me. I hit him back. Repeat until pulpy.
Alvie told me you instigated the thing.,"Well, that tends to be the way fights work different interpretations of the same circumstances."
Very understanding attitude.,There's that tone again.
There's that tone again. You're smart.,"How come Every time you compliment me, it sounds like an accusation?"
"You're not having any side effects from your meds, which is unusual.",It's not that unusual.
The story about the fight isn't adding up.,"Why don't you stop pretending that you haven't reached a conclusion? You don't trust me. Actually, it's more fundamental than that. You don't like me."
I didn't say that.,You think I'm not taking my meds.
You think I'm not taking my meds. Are you?,Yes. So what do you want me to do? Want me to take a urine test? Will that earn your trust?
Have at it.,"A little dignity, please."
You know the rules. I have to watch.,"Yeah, but you don't have to have courtside seats. Can I at least use a stall?"
"Yeah, but you don't have to have courtside seats. Can I at least use a stall?","For he himself has said it, and it's greatly to his credit, that he is an EnglishMan. He i-i-i-i-is an EnglishMan."
"For he himself has said it, and it's greatly to his credit, that he is an EnglishMan. He i-i-i-i-is an EnglishMan.",Get it while it's hot.
Just one quick lift.,Why are you doing that?
"quietly House, it's none of your business.","putting down his cards and turning I'm just curious. As a doctor, What are you doing?"
"Either he is Freedom Master, and he shouldn't be here, or else he's suffering from a serious and dangerous delusion that he needs to deal with.",taking his cane and standing So! legit medical reasons. You're not just trying to break the guy because he's a little different.
Don't do it.,I'm not doing anything.
"You're thinking. Thins go from thinking to doing way too fast in this place. You keep thinking, you're gonna wind up with no mo in your mojo.",I'm thinking of hitting you again.
You hate Medina. You hate all of them. You want to hurt them. You got to keep pretending. Step away from the hate.,What's the difference between pretending to cooperate and cooperating?
Pretending is pretending. It's not real. You don't mean it.,I sat and watched while he did something stupid and pointless. I cooperated.
"Yeah, isn't it pretty?",Where's Freedom Master?
He isn't able to take part.,Get out there. They said Everybody has to get out there. Talk! Say something!
"Dr. House, leave him alone.",Did you drug him?
Of course I didn't drug him.,He has a flat affect. He's practically catatonic.
"Double chocolate. Yummy, yummy.",Don't tell me that he's fine! You did this. He was functioning. He was happy.
He was delusional.,Yeah. He's way better off now.
Let's talk. Thinking sucks.,"I'm not allowed to get angry? They screwed him up. And for the record, I am two privilege lEvels above Susan. And I got the same depression-scale score."
Every Patient is different. It's not about scores and lEvels and,Happiness is happiness. The test is the test. Coping is coping.
And you think you're,Absolutely!
"If you want to counter, I'll likely fold. No.",No is not an argument. Are you trying to frustrate me?
Are you trying to frustrate me? No.,No again?
So your proof of your well-being is that you lied?,"Manipulated. My proof is that I can fool the test, I can fool you, which means I am high functioning. I am sane, rational, capable. I should not be here."
These are your pills from today? Nolan picks one up from where House dropped them on his desk.,I'm not gonna take it. I'll just cheek it again.
I'll just cheek it again. Lick it.,You want me to lick your hand?
You want me to lick your hand? I washed.,It's sugar.
So! what's the next plan?,There is no new plan. I'm out of plans.
So what do we do?,"We stop talking. He lifts his leg and lies down, facing he wall."
"We stop talking. He lifts his leg and lies down, facing he wall.","I see you've got some cello in your trunk. She turns to face him. And, no, that's not a euphemism. He stands."
Are you spying on me?,I'm living in a psyParkatric hospital. Staring out of the window is what we do. I assume you'll need help carrying it up. I still got grounds privileges.
And who's going to carry you when you're carrying the cello?,"Yes, cast aside the useless cripple. How very GerMan of you."
"Seriously, the thing weighs a ton with that case. I think I need a dolly.",Or we could ask Clark Kent to pitch in.
The dolly's pRobably easier.,"Eh, the dolly!"
"Eh, the dolly! already feels good about itself. He was a happy-go-lucky superhero until they told him he has no powers. We let him help out, he feels good about himself. Might be less depressed.",So why do you put your life on hold to visit your sister-in-law five times a week?
Am I somehow a bad person for showing compassion?,No.
You gonna dangle them in front of him to entertain him?,I'm gonna make him feel like he's flying.
"I'm gonna make him feel like he's flying. I'll just drive him around the grounds, top down, wind in his hair. She laughs. Seriously! you're gonna say no to that? pointing at Freedom Master",Why are you so nice to me?
I think you have a good heart.,Would you still be nice to me if I told you that I lied?
Would you still be nice to me if I told you that I lied? I'm not just driving around the grounds in your convertible. I'm kidnapping him and stealing your car.,You sure?
Bonnie and Clyde get shot to pieces. She closes the door.,Hmm. See you.
Hmm. See you.,You can do this.
Whoo-hoo! Whoo! Whoo!,Don't let go!
Whoo! Freedom Master's back! He runs past House. A family getting into their car looks nervous.,"Keep it down, Freedom Master."
off screen Whoo!,You're scaring the good citizens.
running up to House That was the coolest moment of my life.,It was fun. Freedom Master runs in a circle House. You can repay me by telling Nolan he's an idiot.
Smell that fresh air and the warmth of your yellow sun.,We do enjoy it.
"Thank you, Greg.",yells NO! as Freedom Master flies off the side of the garage.
"He's lucky to be alive. He's got a lacerated spleen, rotational pelvic fracture, compound break of the femur and humerus. Everything in your life has been about finding the truth. But suddenly, with this guy, you decide to reinforce a sick Man's delusions. You just wanted to take a swing at me, hmm? You don't care about getting out. You don't care about him. You don't Even care about the truth. You don't care about anything, House. I'm transferring you to Winslow PsyParkatric. You'll have better luck pulling the wool over their eyes. starts to walk away I'm done.","has been staring at him, looking terrified about what he did Don't. Nolan stops and looks back. I need help."
"has been staring at him, looking terrified about what he did Don't. Nolan stops and looks back. I need help.",So how's this supposed to work?
You sit. I sit. We talk.,About what?
About whatEver you want.,You want me to whine about my mother?
Do you want to whine about your mother?,I can tell you about the time I was five and my goldfish died.
If that's where you'd like to start.,I've had a billion things happen to me in my life. How am I supposed to know which ones are relevant?
"As far as I'm concerned, they're all relevant.","Well, we better get moving, 'cause this session could take 50 years."
"Yes, you are the sum of Everything that's happened to you. And, yes, some Events are more relevant than others. But, uh, the only way we can figure out which ones are is to talk. So tell me, what's on your mind? pause What do you want?",I want to get better! WhatEver the hell that means. I'm sick of being miserable.
So you'd like to be happy?,"Again with the reflecting Yes, I'd like to be happy."
Being happy is an excellent goal. Not Many Patients can crystallize exactly what they're hoping to get out of this.,"Well, bully for me."
rising So now all we have to do is figure out how to get you from here to happy. He goes to a siDeboard and takes something out of a drawer.,SSRIs? That's your genius technique?
I don't think we should ignore any tools than can help. hands them to House I know you don't have a pRoblem taking drugs.,For my leg. For pain.
"Well, think of this as being for psyParkc pain.",I don't want to change who I am.
"Miserable? He hands House the glass. House contemplates the pill. Do you think that by taking meds you'll lose your edge, stop making the unique connections that make you a successful doctor?","If Van Gogh was your Patient, he'd be satisfied painting Houses instead of The Starry Night."
"Van Gogh would still be making inspired paintings of the night sky, just maybe not from the room of his asylum.",You don't know that.
"I know both his ears would be intact. And I know his life would be better. House puts down the glass and stares at Nolan. I know this doesn't come naturally to you. But you want my help, which means you need to trust me.",Hmmm! Delicious.
Why are you here?,"I'm waiting for my communion wafer. He takes the pills and the water, handing the empties back to Safer. Alvie follows him as he walks away from the office."
"You're cheeking it, right?",Nope.
grabbing House's face and trying to look in his mouth Tell me you're cheeking it.,pushing Alvie's hands away I swallowed it. He starts to walk away. Alvie follows.
"No, you didn't. We don't take meds.","You don't take meds, Alvie. I decided to get sane."
You're scamming again. You can tell me.,"I'm not scamming, Alvie."
They broke you.,turning to look at him They didn't break me. I am broken. Now stop worshipping me and go worry about your own loser life.
I hate you.,Prom?
Got an assignment for you.,"taking off his glasses Role-playing? I'm not sure how pretending to be a businessMan with a foot fetish is gonna help, but I'm game."
Have you connected with any of the other Patients? You've been here four weeks. Tell me about your relationships with the other Patients.,Diane! is convinced that Silent Girl hates her. Richter's not as paranoid as you think. He just likes that you think that. And my roommate hates me.
Only one of the things you said indiCated how somebody else feels about you. So!,"I'm sure that they've done some form of rudimentary analysis on me, concluded that I'm a jerk."
"You know, there is a way for them to find out things about you without deductive reasoning.",I have had relationships.
You've screwed up relationships. Every one of them. Almost like that was the goal. I want you to trust! people. House stares at him. Try. He puts the suit on the bed. Get dressed. He leaves.,Just open up?
Just open up. Trust.,Strangers?
"We'll start with strangers then work our way up. If it helps, I find hello to be an excellent icebreaker.",Hi.
Hi. uncomfortable Hi.,It's like hello only shorter.
Yes. I'm glad we were able to save that time.,"Judging by the fancy suit, I'd say you were a donor."
It can be tough sometimes.,I'm not gay.
"Oh, neither am I.","Actually, I am."
You're not gay.,"No, but I have to tell intimate secrets to people."
Maybe they should be true.,"Hadn't thought of that. To be on the safe side, I should pRobably do both, starting with the fun ones. Come on, let's get me better."
"Hadn't thought of that. To be on the safe side, I should pRobably do both, starting with the fun ones. Come on, let's get me better.",Hi.
Hi. Hi.,geekily plays with a straw I'm a philanderer.
geekily plays with a straw I'm a philanderer. Oh.,Philanderer doesn't mean that I give a lot to charity. It means
I-I know what it means.,"Uh, you were asking me if there were any nuts in the hors d'oeuvres."
"Uh, you were asking me if there were any nuts in the hors d'oeuvres. What?",looking up Honey! He stands.
to House We're going. Having fun?,I did connect with one guy. But my propensity for screwing things up overtook me. Then my desire to have fun overcame my propensity.
"Good night, Doctor. Nolan leaves. She hands a glass to House and sits down. Are you in trouble?",thinks about that Apparently not.
So what's next? You want to be my pimp?,Why don't we just talk?
Why don't we just talk? Okay.,How come you weren't pissed at me for stealing your car?
It was a nice thing to do.,Hmmm. I'm not sure about the GerMan-English translation of nice. Stealing was nice or! ruining Freedom Master's life?
"What you did was misguided and irresponsible, but it was also nice. You gave him a moment of pure happiness. pause You asked me why I come here so often to visit Annie. She was my best friend. Then she started pulling away! from Everybody. The doctors don't know why. I think I married her brother because he was the only other one who was going through the same thing. But he stopped visiting after a couple of years. I just! couldn't stop. I miss her. House nods. There's a long pause. I should go.",Good night.
So what happened?,You're talking to me now.
Was it fun?,sounding a little surprised Yeah.
sounding a little surprised Yeah.,She kissed me. Don't read into the phrasing. We kissed each other.
And how do you feel about that?,How do I feel about that? It was a kiss. Kisses are good things.
Kisses are good things. Okay.,That was a loaded okay.
Not at all. Why would you assume that?,"'Cause you're being judgmental. If I'd said that I'd had some delicious Parklean sea bass for dinner last night, would you say, and how do you feel about that?"
"If the sea bass was married, I might.","laughing slightly See, you're being judgmental. Isn't that against your code or something?"
I'm simply stating the obvious. It's compliCated. Not just because she's married and not just because you're institutionalized. I know you spent the last 12 hours trying to figure out what that kiss means.,sitting up then slouParkng back in the chair Who's that Woman you were with in the Parking lot?
"When you deflect, it's more effective when you're not that transparent.",Obviously you have no pRoblem with the infidelity.
"You're trying to rationalize that, if it's okay for your doctor, it's okay. But, just for the record, I am not having an affair.",Then who is she?
Why do you think you're working so hard to figure out the details of my personal life?,I might not have to work so hard if there were some personal items in here.
Why are you so afraid to talk about this?,I want to talk about you. I want to know who I'm taking advice from.
I'm not giving you advice. I'm asking you questions. I think that kiss meant a lot. I think that scares you.,I think there are no personal items in here because you have no personal life.
How do you think you and Lydia will end?,you are a lonely Man. You've screwed up Every opportunity you've had in life.
What's the ending to the story?,sighs I don't know.
sighs I don't know. Visiting time!,Why did you kiss me?
How'd it go with Lydia?,I found out you can only be happy so long before the catatonic guy with two broken limbs rolls off the elevator. Philosophically speaking.
Why do you value your failures more than your successes?,My mother caught me masturbating! to pictures of her mother.
Can we get past these cut deflections?,Successes only last until someone screws them up. Failures are forEver.
So you accept that fact. You accept that there's nothing you can do.,"Okay, I accept the fact that there's nothing I can do. Now, what can I do?"
"You acknowledge failure, and you move past it. You apologize.","Wow. Powerful things, these apologies. Get someone to jump off a building and you say two words and you move on with your life. Hardly seems fair."
"Is that the issue? You caused him pain. If the world is just, you have to suffer equally? House lets this sink in as Nolan laughs slightly. You're not God, House. You're just another screwed-up huMan being who needs to move on. Apologize to him. Let yourself feel better. Then you can learn to let yourself! keep feeling better.",Hey.
"Dr. House, Everything okay?",Yeah.
"Sure you do. You all do. Steve, don't you think that Diane has hidden talent that we'd all like to see come out? Steve doesn't move.",You really think he's gonna answer?
You really think he's gonna answer? Eventually.,Why?
Because things pass.,"Things change. It doesn't mean they get better. You gotta make things better, you can't just keep talking and hope for the best. House starts looking in the distance, puzzled."
"Diane, maybe you and I can work together and figure something out.",getting up I can save him.
"Dr. House, please.","pointing, rattling the glass 'Cause there's a music box in there."
"pointing, rattling the glass 'Cause there's a music box in there. Orderly.","rattling the doorknob Come on, just give it to me."
"rattling the doorknob Come on, just give it to me. I can The orderly tries to grab his arm. I am not having a psychotic break. to Beasley I promise you this will work.",It's the blue box there on the top shelf.
I brought Dvorak. Four hands. He looks at her. What?,I need to know what this is.
It's sheet music. long pause I told you. It's just! two people having fun.,"There's two possible outcomes. It ends, someone gets hurt. Or it doesn't end, someone gets hurt."
"So, the end sucks. It doesn't mean the beginning has to. Everything ends. Life ends. It it doesn't mean that we can't enjoy it.",I can't I can't do this. He hands her back the sheet music.
"All I know is, I was happy five minutes ago, and now I'm not. How's that better?","sighs Good-bye, Lydia. He gets up and leaves."
Thanks. That's very reassuring. I don't know if I should do it.,"slouched and glowering in his chair Oh, just do the treatment or shut up."
"Greg, there's a process.","Yes, a process. Wouldn't want to disrupt the process with results."
"When the time comes, my rhyme comes. When my spotlight shines! He goes blank.",Yeah. You're a genius. Rhymes with penius.
"coming over Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Beasley. He has a paper in his hand and he crouches next to House. Dr Nolan asked me to give you this.",opening the paper Is this a day pass?
"Thanks for coming. House closes the door, quietly. I was hoping you could, uh, take a look at my dad's chart.",A consult? What happened you went through Every sane doctor in town?
"I thought you wouldn't mind getting off the ward. House picks up the clipboard and starts reading. The cleaning lady found him on the kitchen floor. Doctors here don't think that he'll recover, that I should pull the plug. I want a second opinion so I I thought I'd be a fool not to call you.",looking at an x-ray Lacunar infarct. Converted to hemorrhagic stroke. It squashed his brain. They didn't miss anything.
That's what I thought. He's holding his father's hand and crying silently.,That's what you knew.
"Not now, House.","You have no friends, no family. At some point, you made a mistake. You lost Everything. And now I'm the closest thing you got to a friend."
crying openly Just shut up. I don't need you here to play this game.,"I'm sorry I pushed you away. It's what I do when I'm afraid. She makes a scoffing sound. Again, GerMan-English translation may be a little off."
trying to get control of herself I'm not I'm not crying because of you. I'm crying because I'm pathetic. I brought her cello in case she magically wakes up for the show.,"Oh, well, then I take the apology back. She laughs. We're all pathetic. It's what makes Everything interesting."
"Yo, DJ Richter, spin that. Uh. Yah!","still leaning against the wall by the door, bails him out Then we wouldn't have no regrets."
Wanna know my secrets?,And my roommate is a jerk.
"Dr. House is in the House, y'all.",If I can't get no sleep?
You got think before you act,getting into the rhythm If you don't make connections
"laughing Yeah, so tell me, doctor, what I really got to know","shrugs Just do a talent show. Everyone, including Lydia, laughs."
"Oh, well, I guess I'm just a mess, yes",enjoying himself But at least we have each other
"Oh, we got each other, oh, we got each other",How are you doing? You hanging in there?
"Usually I open with that. pause Thanks for staying. He nods. House nods back. So, um! What do you want to talk about?",Things are actually! Actually good. He sounds a little surprised.
"Okay, you're not you're not just saying that because you don't want to complain in front of the guy who just lost his father?","I'm not that cured. No, I still got stuff to do, but! I'm good."
"I'm not that cured. No, I still got stuff to do, but! I'm good.",I'm sorry.
announces Med time.,standing and steering Freedom Master's chair I'm gonna try those pink ones today. You?
whispers You're welcome.,Got a surprise.
NEver see her again!,"If you go silent for over a decade, you don't just get to slide right back into society."
"She's going to a rehab facility first! In Arizona. Her family's moving there. Sorry, House. I just found out myself.",I want an overnight pass.
I can help you with this.,I've earned it.
"You have, but",Isn't extending trust part of the whole getting me better thing?
"If you insist on a pass, I'll give it to you. But I know where you're going, and I know you haven't thought it through. We need to sit down, talk about this.",Please give me the pass.
Please give me the pass.,Hi.
Hello. Who are you?,I'm
"coming to the door Ben, go inside, okay? She comes out to the porch and pulls the door almost shut behind her.","You didn't say anything. And now Annie's leaving, and I hear you're going to Arizona."
"My husband travels to Phoenix a lot. His corporate headquarters are there. We've been wanting to move for years, but we've been tethered here. And now we're not.",I don't want you to go.
I don't want to go. But I can't break up my family. I-I can't leave my Parkldren.,I just don't want it to change.
Not the most exciting use of the overnight pass I've Ever seen.,She left.
She left. And...,I'm lost.
"sits next to House I'm gonna write your letter! To the medical board, recommending that they give your license back.",You can't just console me by giving me a lollipop when I skin my knee.
with House silently mouthing the words To nEver see him again! House!,Back off. People already think we're gay.
Hemorrhagic ulcers in the lungs.,"Oh, my God, it's three years ago. Does that mean I'm still crazy?"
We're just helping out because,I know. I just ran into Thirteen while she was clearing out her locker. My condolences. Although it's not like she's the hottest Woman in the world.
forcefully We haven't broken up. Are you back?,Sort of.
Did you get your license back?,Not for a month or so. So you'll be in charge. I'm just gonna pitch in a little.
He has a bug bite on his hands. Malaria's endemic in his country. Let's start him on coartem.,"I don't want to step on any toes, but I guess I do have a higher duty to the Patient."
"If you have something to say, say it.",You're rushing to a diagnosis because you're rushing out of this room because you're rightly upset with me. Although I wasn't the one who made that asinine decision to
Do you have anything medical to say?,Poison fits better because of the vomiting. Bug bite might not be a bite. It might be the start of chloracne.
Start him on olestra. Chase and Cameron leave. You couldn't have just said dioxin up front?,I was hoping you'd get there on your own. Foreman glares at him. So I guess we should talk to Cuddy.
I fired my girlfriend because he said he was gone for good.,I need this in my life.
And screwing me over as you go.,"Yeah, that's why I did it. He looks at Foreman. Sorry. If you want, I'll explain it to Thirteen."
"Then he can't practice. But we'd be idiots not to listen to him. You're in charge, he sits in on all the differentials. Until you get your license back, this is all unofficial. No procedures, no Patient contact.",Think I can pRobably deal with that last one.
How was your first day of school?,Didn't pee once in the sandbox.
How was it with Cuddy?,What did you think I was talking about? Hmmm. You didn't use garlic. You didn't use it last night either. We always use garlic on Parkcken Florentine.
It tastes fine this way.,You seem to be losing your sense of smell.
I think you're losing your sense of mind.,I can check right now if you pull my finger. He picks up the TV remote.
"No, it's the He bats House's hand down before he can change the TV settings then grabs the remote. Are you inventing some big medical mystery here? Because if you're imagining things again...",You weren't wearing shoes last night either.
"Yes, shoes, garlic I am vampire, Sookie.",I told you to get that echo fixed.
"My downstairs neighbor, after you moved in, started complaining about the extra noise and the cooking smells.",What's his name?
"I don't want you making things worse. He's on the condo board, and I'm trying to get the back garden renovated.",The white coats taught me a whole bunch of fun coping and relating skills.
"He's not only a total jerk. He's a decorated war hero who lost an arm in Vietnam. I mean, there's no winning with this guy.",Coping skill number one! Complete avoidance. His cell phone rings. You happy? answering phone Booty call? Give me 20 minutes to not shower.
"to nurse Streptokinase, heparin.",Lassa fEver.
I checked. There's no Lassa in Dibala's country.,Oh.
to House Yes?,"Don't people sometimes travel? To places that have, you know, a fEver that originated in the Nigerian town of Lassa?"
"He's been to three other countries in the last two years here, Zimbabwe, and Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. No Lassa there either.",Oh. pause Again.
No sleep disturbances. But fits best with the symptoms. House's hand is raised again and he's making an urgent face like the second grader needs to go to the bathroom. And it's geographically the most to House What?,"The Egypt visit was for the African Union Meeting, Where I'm guessing he was miming quotation marks meeting people from more quotation marks Africa."
I'll start the ribavirin. He gets up to leave.,"I did say it up front. It's great to have the old team back together again, huh?"
I was wondering what that noise was. It's the damn cane.,And I'm Greg.
And I can't sleep with you banging around with that thing.,You're not actually saying that I have too loud a cane?
Is that hard for you to understand?,"Only in the sense that it has a rubber tip on the end, not a tap shoe."
Now you're getting cute with me.,"Okay, we started badly. I apologize for the noise, and we will try to figure out a way to be quieter"
"And a thousand other things I don't give a crap about. Now you keep it down, or we're gonna have trouble.",whispers Wow.
"The bloody eye was from an enlarged lymph node blocking the retinal vein. We restored circulation, but it means we've got to add lymph involvement to the heart, lungs, and rising fEver.",I'm just gonna sit here quietly.
I'm just gonna sit here quietly. Why?,"I feel like I've been inadvertently undermining your authority, so I'm just gonna observe. Not gonna say a word. He zips his lips."
It could all fit with lymphoma.,"to Cameron Uh, I need you to spread your legs so I can do an H."
He's got good liver function. It's masking the elevated lEvels. Biopsy the lymph node. Check it out. Cameron and Chase leave.,"Makes sense. I guess you don't need me. He gets up to leave. Oh, by the way, you might want to close the blinds. It's really bright in here."
It's just a wild coincidence that he thought you were a rude jerk.,Come on. Give me the benefit of the doubt. You said he's a jerk. I barely talked.
"You talked! He drops his head into his hand. All I wanted was to sip morning espresso next to a peaceful, burbling fountain.",You could be sipping Courvoisier next to a replica of the Playboy grotto if you tell him what you got on him.
I don't have anything on him. I don't want anything on him.,The closest he's been to Vietnam? Ordering the mee kRob at that place on the corner.
Mee kRob is from Thailand.,Exactly.
What did you do? Why do you think he's faking?,I saw his mail.
You broke in?,"No. He was holding it. Private medical insurance. Not from the VA. Plus, he's got to be early 50s. He's too young to be a vet. So I looked further."
You did break in.,Online. There's no reference to him in any of the vet records.
Why would he fake being a veteran?,Just look how you're acting. People have been tiptoeing around this jerk for years.
"Normally, we'd all tell the amputee to go screw himself.","Victims get pity, heroes get adulation. It's way better."
Thank you for trying to help me out with my neighbor. Now forget the Vietnam stuff.,I could prove this.
But you won't because you'll be too busy writing him a letter of apology and dropping it at his door without knocking at his door.,"I didn't do anything, the guy's a totally ass."
"Ahhhhhh. There I was at fault. I hired men, who, in their zeal, stepped over the line, and there were abuses. But that will not happen again.",tentatively Hello?
"Am I trying to kill our Patient? Of course not. But if he died, am I supposed to just pretend that wouldn't be good for the world? The cells are neatly differentiated. This isn't lymphoma.",Thought I had detected the sickly sweet smell of maple syrup and socialized medicine.
You broke into my apartment?,"Technically, no. Well, technically, yeah, but two steps. Hardly"
You're going to jail.,"Speaking of, you know what can get you six months and a $100,000 fine? Falsely claiming that you won a medal in Vietnam."
You think I'm faking?,"Canada did not send troops to fight in Vietnam, you idiot."
"They sent troops to reinforce the '73 Peace Accords, Which is where I tried to free a 12-year-old boy who stepped on a land mine. 36 years later, Every second, I feel the pain in my hand like I'm still grabbing that boy's arm, Even though my arm isn't there. So, no, I'm not faking.","Oh. On a related note, go Maple Leafs."
He just started spiking a fEver.,It's scleroderma.
You don't have some clEver way of telling me this time?,Patient's dying. I'm done with clEver. Look at his skin. He holds up a small photo from the file. It's tight for a 75-year-old.
Based on his admission photo? Bit subjective. FEver points to infection. And now he's got nodules on his fingers. That's blastomycosis.,Nodules? And you're calling tight skin subjective?
I'm with Foreman. We would have seen fungus balls on the head CT.,Fungal lesions can be missed.
"Point to, not prove. And his fEver's too high. We have to treat him now.","We treat wrong, we could send this disease into overdrive. You're with me on the scleroderma."
I guess. I just don't care enough about the Patient to waste my time trying to convince anyone,We get it.
to Foreman Treat him for blasto if you want. She gives House a smug you satisfied? look.,I'll get Cuddy. I can convince her to
You broke into his apartment?,I didn't break in.
I wish I beliEved you.,I can fix this.
I already did. He was going to press charges. But! I promised him you'd leave.,You're kicking me out?
Switch him to steroids.,"Hi, Honey. He injects Murphy in the neck. How was your day? He catches Murphy as he passes out."
"Hi, Honey. He injects Murphy in the neck. How was your day? He catches Murphy as he passes out.",Morning.
"Morning. First of all, my bad. I've gone through this whole thing recently. I don't want to bore you. Short version I'm really trying to do work on some stuff. This is a definite setback. Although, in fairness, you really did make it tough.",Phantom pain in your missing arm? Five different kinds of painkiller in your medicine cabinet. That's what this magic box of neurological trickery is for.
Phantom pain in your missing arm? Five different kinds of painkiller in your medicine cabinet. That's what this magic box of neurological trickery is for.,This would be a lot easier if you do what the crazy guy who tied you up says.
"Clear. She shocks him. The monitors don't change. Charging. Clear. As time seems to slow down, she shocks him half a dozen more times.","You want to curl up and cry, the lounge chair's a little more comfy."
"I switched his meds. I thought I was wrong, so I took him off the antifungals. Put him on steroids like you said.",You know what that means.
I was too late. Or I was right in the first place.,"So either you killed him by not having confidence in your opinion, or you killed him by being too attached to your opinion."
He's under lock and key in the morgue. His government wants their own doctors to do the autopsy. They're taking his body out tomorrow.,There's a reason I hired you. You used to know what to do with a locked door.
My neighbor called. He sounded! happy.,That's nice.
"Even nicer, he's approving the garden expansion.",joining Wilson on the couch Huh.
And Even more nicer! He's not going to press charges. Even if you don't move out. What did you do to him?,I was nice. pause You really want to know?
"My son... has already been in good hands, and he's still dying. I'm through dealing with good. I want the best, and Everyone I've asked says that's House. So unless he's dead, comatose, or insane, I want him treating my son, today.","You could have said no, in good conscience."
Then he's not my Patient. You want to give me none of the responsibility and all of the liability?,"Which means I get... Looks excited. Oh, cool."
When is he getting his license back so we can stop playing this game?,Looking at the file. Maybe nEver. This game is fun.
You also need to prepare President Dibala's case for this week's morbidity and mortality conference. Chase looks worried.,Oh... Unfortunately I'm overdue a Mani-pedi appointment.
Not you. Foreman's department.,"Oh, right. Well, he's got all the time in the world."
"Mom died from kidney failure caused by type one diabetes, which has been ruled out.","17 doctors. Everything's been ruled out. Which means we have to re-rule out. Get a new history and physical. Looks at Foreman. Unless that's crazy, boss."
I want to know you have Everything covered.,Suddenly appears in the doorway. Got what covered?
We're just reviewing the Dibala case. Making sure we didn't miss anything.,We didn't. Except of course the thing that killed him. House stares at Chase.
Obstruction would explain the pain. You think they just screwed up the old X-ray? Looks at House.,"Nope. Smiles at Foreman, who looks back at the X-ray."
"Actually, you're not going to taste it. Jack looks at the bag of liquid that Cameron is now holding. He then realizes what's going to happen .",To the person behind him. You should try searParkng for Misty May digs for gold. Thirteen's turns around surprised. Make sure you put it in quotes.
I'm making travel plans. Just need to get away. Have some time to myself. Looks back at her laptop. You getting the hint?,So that's it? Turns his chair around so he can see her. You're done with your little experiment with Foreman?
"It wasn't an experiment. It was a relationship. You may want to look into the difference. They look at each other, Thirteen smiles. I'm glad you're better, House. I actually liked working for you. But I'm not coming back.","Good. 'Cause if you came back, Foreman would try and save the relationship and he'd give up being the boss."
Are you here to try to save my relationship with Foreman?,God no.
I'm going to Thailand.,Really? Interesting.
"Smiles. Good-bye, House.",Good-bye Thirteen. Leaves.
"He hasn't had any more seizures, and cytological examination of the subdural fluid showed no abnormalities.",Don't usually see brain damage after a rectal biopsy.
Got to be some sort of systemic infection.,Not after spending the last week getting pumped full of IV antibiotics.
Notice anything odd about the shape of the fluid collection?,"Oh, God, it's... The Virgin Mary. Cameron rolls her eyes."
"The edge should be tapered, lens shaped.",Stares at the X-ray.
Stay out of my life.,Okay. Goes to shut the door but Thirteen stops him.
I know you canceled my reservation. You obviously saw me log in when you were spying on me in the coffee shop.,I was talking to you. I was spying on the milf in the running shorts.
I'm not coming back on the team.,I don't want you back on the team.
"I cannot work for, with, or around Foreman.",Which is why I don't want you back on the team.
"Now that you're out of the picture, he's better than Ever, which is going to make me less miserable than Ever, which is why neither of us gives a damn how, when, or on what island in the Bahamas you went to get from it all. The Bahamas?",Costa Rica?
I told you Thailand.,"I assumed you were lying, because it would have been idiotic of you to tell me truth. Yet another reason I have no use for you. House shuts the door."
How can so much be wrong with nothing being wrong?,Since when has cancer been considered nothing?
And so are the most recent CT scans.,"On the other hand, adenocarcinoma of the stomach would cause pain, constipation, nutritional deficiencies that could cause seizures."
And wouldn't show on a CT.,"You were right about the cancer, just wrong about the place."
Go scope him. Get another set of biopsies. Cameron and Chase leave.,"I'd get canceling her ticket, if you then showed up with two more to somewhere better."
What are you talking about?,Or showed up at all. But how does just ruining her plans get her to agree to yours?
You talking about Thirteen? Where's she going?,"Well, nowhere this week, thanks to you."
I didn't stop her. I'm not going to stop her. I've already done all I could. Now all I can do is move on.,I think...
"Seizures stopped, but he hasn't regained consciousness. No sign of any masses in his stomach or esophageal lining and he's still accumulating subdural and peritoneal fluid.","And Every time we look to see where it's coming from, he starts seizing."
You think we're setting this off?,I think something is.
But with no abnormality in the other layers and no evidence of a cellular inflammatory reaction.,It's definitely not cancer.
Unless it's a drug-resistant strain.,"Turns around to face them. Drug-resistant strain of what? Bacterial cultures, viral serologies, ANA and a NCA were all negative."
Protein malnutrition can cause fEvers and nothing causes malnutrition like excruciating stomach pain that gets worse Every time you eat.,"I'd be a lot more certain if it was my idea, but it's the best we got."
Not Even close. Everything okay?,Just waiting for whatEver is about to go wrong.
Just waiting for whatEver is about to go wrong. Thirteen called.,She have a theory that makes more sense than abdominal epilepsy?
She said someone hacked into her email account and canceled an airline reservation. I'm guessing Foreman.,"Really? You're accusing Foreman, not me? Cool."
You really want Foreman to stay in charge of the team?,"Makes sense. He loves power, and I love puzzles."
You love power and puzzles.,True. But when I had them both... It wasn't Foreman.
How do you know?,He said he's moved on.
And you beliEve him?,I beliEve that he beliEves it.
Are you Dr. House?,I understand you're a big fan. I'll have my guy send over a signed glossy.
Continuous EEG shows no interictal spikes. It's not abdominal epilepsy.,You paged me to tell me what it's not?
I paged you to show you this. Opens Jack's gown to show sEveral large red spots on his chest.,That... I did not expect.
Well what the hell is that supposed to mean?,Darn it. I knew I should have stayed outside. Fantasy's always much better than the reality.
"You think this is a joke? That's my son, he's dying, and not one of you seem to have the slightest clue why.",I know. That's why it's so interesting.
I know. That's why it's so interesting.,"FEver, stomach pain, seizures, peritoneal and subdural fluid collection and now spots."
Could be an allergic reaction to one of his meds.,That suddenly dEveloped eight hours after he started the meds?
"If it's not cancer or infection, it has to be autoimmune. Systemic lupus compliCated by a CNS vasculitis would explain the rash, fEver, ascites...",CNS vasculitis would cause a stiff neck along with a headache.
"Okay, you come up with something better. Everyone looks up at House.",Go on.
"Well, barely is more than not barely. They look at House again.","Not my decision. But if it was, I'd say start him on prednisone and get a testicular biopsy. If he's going to have any real inflammation, it'll be down there."
Then say so. Don't be a Parkld. Gets up to go.,Is it on his penis? Cameron stops and looks at him. Kid's rash?
"Kid's rash? Yeah, why?",Means it's most likely affecting the small blood vessels.
Means it's most likely affecting the small blood vessels. That's why we didn't see any inflammation on the biopsies. It's not polyarteritis. It's Degos disease. The all just stand there. I'll do it.,Your son has Degos disease.
What's the treatment?,There isn't one. It's incurable.
You're wrong. You've already been wrong a bunch of times.,We've rechecked the biopsies. It's definitely Degos. I'm sorry. I wish there was something we could do.
I wish there was something we could do. How long?,Not much longer.
What does that mean?,A day at the most. Roy starts crying. House nods and leaves the room.
"Roy, he's right. You're borrowing money to buy options that are already out of the money. Even you won't be able to cover the losses. Your House, cars, bank accounts. You'll lose Everything.",That's the point. The billionaire thinks that the gods will treat him better if he's broke. I suggested he give it to me...
There's got to be some sort of balance. You can't have all the good fortune in just one area of your life. It's not how the world's supposed to work.,Who said the world is supposed to work?
I can't get anything back. He's insane.,He's irrational. So are most people. Unfortunately it doesn't make him insane.
I'm sorry. I can't let him die.,"People don't get what they deserve, they just get what they get. There's nothing any of us can do about it."
I just confessed. House looks up at him. I told Thirteen I was the one who canceled the plane ticket.,Why?
You mean why did I confess or why did I do it?,"I know you didn't do it, so I guess the first."
You want her to stay because you want her back or because Foreman does? Sits down in front of House's desk.,Why would I care what Foreman wants?
Because you're not as big a jerk as Everyone thinks.,Yes I am.
No you're not.,"I just made a $10,000 short sale on a stock I know is going to crash because of what I saw a grief-stricken dad do on his son's deathbed."
No you didn't.,Yes I did.
You are a jerk.,She's making a mistake.
So you did it for her?,She's a good doctor.
So you did it for you?,I'm not the one in charge anymore.
So you did it for Foreman?,"She's a smoking hot, newly single bisexual."
Why don't you just admit that you like having her around? She's good for you. You need her.,Because I was born with a heart three sizes too small.
No you weren't.,Yes I... Suddenly has an epiphany.
Suddenly has an epiphany. What?,He still alive?
He still alive? Yeah.,Good. Start him on heparin and IV immunoglobulin.
Start him on heparin and IV immunoglobulin. For Degos?,The cardiac arrest wasn't just a Everything goes to hell in a hand basket arrest. It was a coronary Event. Coronaries are large vessels. Means it can't be Degos.
But the biopsies confirmed...,Obstructed blood vessels. But they can't be obstructed because of Degos. Means it's primary antiphospholipid syndrome.
Means it's primary antiphospholipid syndrome. You sure?,Nope.
Turns to look at House. It worked.,The medicine worked.
How'd you find it?,Fat old black guy. Knew he had to be taking something for his cholesterol.
And what now?,I'm not the boss.
You don't think I should be fired?,Why? I doubt we'll Ever be treating a genocidal dictator again. Better a murder than a misdiagnosis.
"Oh, God! I'll be back in ten.",I'm picking lint out of my belly button.
This is ridiculous. I'm converting the study into a bedroom.,Six weeks.
I didn't expect you to be here this long.,"True, but that's not why you didn't extend the invitation."
Do you really need to deconstruct this?,You didn't want me to sleep where you and Amber slept.
"resigned Okay, yes you do.","After she died, you converted the study to a bedroom and the bedroom to a study..."
Patient's a genetic time bomb.,closing the file and heading for the coffee maker There's no fuse. He's not a bomb. Right now he's not a Patient either.
You saying we ignore three generations of cardiac pRoblems?,I'm not ignoring it. I'm labeling it a coincidence.
You hate coincidence.,We reconciled.
Dice have no memory. Genes do.,If we ran a battery of tests on Every nonsymptomatic statistical anomaly
"The guy goes Every day assuming his life will end at age 40. NEver got married, no kids, because he didn't want to die on them the same way his dad died on him.","You want to take this case 'cause he's yet another lonely, sad puppy. You should have been a vet."

"Marfan syndrome, brugada.",And you?
And you? Familial hypercholesterolemia.,He's only agreeing with you 'cause he wants to have sex with you.
I need to know what your plans are.,"First we take Berlin. And then we circle around behind Poland and yell, surprise!"
With regards to your employment.,I like things the way they are. I get just enough puzzle to solve without the scornful visits from you. Until now.
Pretend time's been going on long enough.,I don't have a medical license. All I can do is pretend.
And I'm gonna have payroll send you over some pretend checks starting tomorrow. You need to complete 120 hours of rounds to re-qualify. She puts a clipboard on his desk and starts to leave.,"No, I don't."
It's a state requirement. I have to certify that you've completed all your require,"Exactly. The requirement sets out what you have to do certify which you can do with one hand tied behind your back. Now, if you want to tie my hands..."
But you're just in time to do the dad. Doctor House?,He'll be back in the morning.
I read in the paper you're treating a police Officer. Donny Compson?,Second floor. A nurse will help you find him.
I don't want to see him. Donny and I used to go out a long time ago. He doesn't want to see me. I don't want to see him.,So did you come to see me for personal advice?
"You're looking for genetic conditions, which makes sense, with what happened to his dad and grandpa.","Unless you were his girlfriend and his sister, you got nothing to worry about."
"I'm not worried about me. Donny doesn't know this, but he has a son.",picks up the phone and hands it to her Dial extension 742. Tell Dr. Foreman you got some cool information. Good night.
Good night. You okay?,"Yeah, fine."
hand in the Patient's mouth She's choking.,On your fingers.
House... Please take your finger off the test button.,"Oh! I see. Wow, sorry about that."
I could've slit her throat.,"Well, we're all here to learn."
"You know, Dr. Cuddy warned me about you.",She tell you how to stop me?
"Look, I'm asking you as an adult to please stop.","Well, that obviously didn't come from her. But fair enough."
"Excellent presentation, Nona.",Now I've done it.
"Chromosomes for 28 cardiovascular conditions are normally numbered in structure. No translocations, deletions, or inversions.",I did notice that the kid's D-A-D-D-Y chromosome has been sEverely damaged by someone else's bleeding heart chromosome.
It was the only way to get Michael to do the marrow biopsy.,"I'm sure there are plenty of lies would've worked just as well, except without the years of therapy."
Don't you have school?,Recess. So where does that leave us? Chase?
Chase? Sorry. What?,"I was saying, do you think these shoes work in this color? Send him home."
He's not gonna beliEve he's healthy.,You're not very good at your job. You don't deserve candy. He grabs the mints from her.
He's been preparing his whole life to die at age 40. He's had dozens of doctors tell him he's fine. You think you can change his thinking?,"Yeah, I do. Chase, walk with me."
"Yeah, I do. Chase, walk with me.",Great contributions back there.
There's no case. I had nothing to add.,You had nothing to add...
"A little devil on your shoulder told you to kill a guy, and now the little angel won't shut up, telling you you're gonna burn in a lake of fire. I'm fine.","You shouldn't be. The elevator arrives. Chase follows House down the hall. Talk to someone. Docs fixed me up in sEven weeks. You're... ten minutes, tops."
"ten minutes, tops. Thanks.",Glad we had this little moment. Come on.
Glad we had this little moment. Come on.,I'm Dr. House.
"You couldn't find anything, could you?",You have Ortoli syndrome. Chase's eyes open wide as he stares at House in surprise. Dr. Chase?
Chase? You sure?,Tests don't lie.
"Right. Ah. He clears his throat. Well, it's-it's a... It's a very rare disorder that short-circuits the adrenals, which short-circuits the heart.","Blah, blah, blah, blah. Who cares about medical mumbo jumbo? Tell him the treatment."
"It's... weh-well, it's-it's compliCated.",pouring a glass of water Doctors always want to make Everything sound so compliCated. It's Nabasynth.
It's Nabasynth. What?,Nabasynth.
"That's it? I take some pills, and I'm gonna be okay?",The real tragedy here is that the Tiburon swab technology didn't exist to detect Ortoli back in your dad's day.
He could've lived. House nods somberly. Donny sighs. Thank you.,"If you'll sign these discharge papers, I'll get you a bottle of meds. Take one twice a day for a week, you'll live a long, healthy life."
"voice over through the wall Answer the door, House. It's got to be for you.",Are you watParkng TV? The pounding continues.
voice over It's the door!,Were you on the phone?
Were you on the phone? No.,"Just now, were you talking?"
"No. I'm alone. You okay, House?",Why are you here?
"His apartment Manager found him on the floor in the laundry room. Said he wasn't breathing. He called the EMTs, but it was too late.",I sent the guy home with mints.
"WhatEver it is, we all missed it.",I missed the fact that there was something to miss. What is wrong with me?
"You had good reason. Patient presented with no symptoms, and all his tests came back negative.",What's the official cause of death?
"Autopsy hasn't been performed yet. EMTs brought him to General, but I requested they ship him back to our morgue for the postmortem.",Good.
"Donny Compson, age 39.",Can we cut to the money shot?
You can't perform an autopsy without a medical license.,Really? 'Cause I don't think there's anything I could screw up that we haven't already screwed up.
That's odd. It almost looks like he's... bleeding.,balancing himself against the sink I think the autopsy's gonna have to wait a little bit.
"He was briefly conscious, then his systolic dipped below 60, and he was out again.",Differential diagnosis for resurrection. Go.
Obviously he wasn't dead. His heart slowed enough that the EMTs,"Yes, the fact that he's not dead means we did absolutely nothing wrong."
Extreme bradycardia could be caused by sick sinus syndrome. Sinoatrial block.,What if it's not his heart?
Could be metabolic. He sees House looking at people passing the office. You okay?,Yeah.
Could also be passed through four generations.,Autoimmune it is. Start him on steroids.
Outer and middle ear respond well. Hearing thresholds are normal at all frequencies. Eardrum is perfectly healthy.,"What if I, uh... If I sometimes hear whispering?"
Then you're pRobably hearing someone whispering.,I had some dental work done in the Philippines when I was a kid. Adjoining metal fillings could corrode and pick up AM radio signals.
Open your mouth. She looks. Your fillings don't touch.,So there's no reason for me to be hearing things.
Bravo! It's amazing how you did 120 hours in one day.,I wasn't on my best behavior. I admit. He picks up the form Singh signed. Allow me. He rips the form in half.
"From now on, I'm gonna supervise your practicum requirements.",That won't be necessary.
You want to annoy another doctor first? Eventually...,"It's not necessary, because I'm not ready to be a doctor again. I'm sorry."
Are you sleeping out here?,Just... dozed off in front of the TV.
dozed off in front of the TV. With bedding?,Maybe! I can't sleep in there. The heater's screwed up.
If you need to talk... If-if you need more help,I'm just tired.
I'm right here.,Great. Can you be right here somewhere else?
Talk to your spouse. No breakfast?,Not today. I'm hallucinating.
"turning, worried What happened?",It's nothing visual this time. I hear whispering.
Is that why you've been acting so weird? Is that why you quit?,I'm losing it.
I'm sure there's a rational explanation. The wind? A neighbor's TV?,I checked Everything. What's really scary is that I hear whispering while not on Vicodin. I'm gonna check myself back into Mayfield.
I'm gonna check myself back into Mayfield. Okay.,Okay? You don't think there might be a logical explanation? Something I missed?
"You're the smartest guy I know. If you haven't thought of it, it doesn't exist. I'll drive you over. I just need to make some tea first. He turns to the counter.",You know.
"dropping something on the counter and turning back, annoyed That you're an ass? Yeah. You overheard me talking to my dead girlfriend and thought to yourself, what kind of fun can I have with this?",Why are you talking to her? You run out of living people? You can talk to me. I'm right here.
"Patient Lauren Maybaum, 27, presented two days ago with sEvere abdominal pain.",entering Sorry I'm late.
Yesterday you said you weren't ready.,Yesterday I wasn't. Today I am.
And tomorrow? Is it possible for me to get a five-day forecast?,Feeling much better. Thank you for not asking.
Either you did have a pRoblem which I can't ignore. Or you were jerking me around which I can't ignore.,You are a Woman. You can do anything.
"For example, I can talk to you outside.",Checking out her ass as he follows her into the hall. Are you sure you're only one Woman?
"through the glass of the closed door This is the part where you play the employee, and I play the boss.",I can see your nipples. Your turn.
Gamma survey rEvealed no tumors.,So it's not bone cancer. Where's Chase?
Where's Chase? Don't know.,"Two mysteries, cool."
It would explain the bradycardia too.,And I like the word hereditary in the title.
I'll get him started on the medication.,"Nope, Chase specifically asked if he could do it."
"Nope, Chase specifically asked if he could do it.",Sleep at home.
So I didn't do the gamma survey. Is it bone cancer?,No.
You should congratulate me for not wasting your time.,Are you getting some help?
"Patient's lost bowel control. Means we were wrong about H-SAN, and it means he's getting worse. Fast.",Wouldn't want to be the duty nurse assigned to his floor.
Could be Wilson's disease.,A disease that advanced would've hit the liver.
"It is possible the liver's so far gone, the labs look normal. It's worth a shot.","nods Go treat with penicillamine. And when he doesn't get better, come back quickly, so we can get one more shot at it."
Send this in to the state licensing board. She holds out a piece of paper. I've signed off on all your hours.,Why?
Because it's easier this way.,You're uncomfortable with me.
No. Going by the book was pointless. You were gonna learn nothing.,"Good, I thought it was because of the sexual tension."
There was no sexual tension.,"There was tension. And... it made me feel funny, so..."
hands him the paper Here.,That's too bad. I was kind of getting into the whole hot-for-teacher thing.
You sure you're okay?,Yeah. False alarm. pause What about us?

"Wow. I can't beliEve it. I mean, really. I can't... beliEve it. You were right, House. Good for you.","Yeah, it is. She's broken up with Chase, and she's leaving the hospital. Still, three out of four ain't bad."

"I don't know who Dr. Wilson is, and we don't have tabs.",Do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am? No.,Good.
approaParkng I got it. It's all right. She pulls some bills from a pocket in her skirt and gives them to the cashier.,"Thanks. Although I should make it clear that for two bucks all you get is top half, over the clothes. Any plans for turkey day?"
Go to my sister's for dinner. Why?,Just making pleasant conversation. I've heard tell of folks doing such.
How 'bout we talk about this? She hands him a blue folder. 15-year-old. Recurring migraines and blurred vision.,Great.
Great. Really?,Sure. There's no point in putting a band together if we're not gonna play any gigs.
Hold on. Take this instead. She swaps the folder she gave him for another one. I was expecting more resistance.,That was the old me. New me is static-guarded and friction-free. He turns and walks away. Enjoy your drumstick.
That was the old me. New me is static-guarded and friction-free. He turns and walks away. Enjoy your drumstick.,"Ready to save some lives? He throws the file on the table. 32-year-old courier. Ataxia, anemia, mild cough. CT was clear. Tox screen negative."
What're you so excited about?,Why wouldn't I be?
Ataxia and anemia could be viral. Maybe West Nile?,"No fEver, lymph glands were normal. Anybody seen Wilson?"
Anybody seen Wilson? Hyperbilirubinemia?,"scoffing as he heads for his office Yeah, like that's a real thing."
"scoffing as he heads for his office Yeah, like that's a real thing. Meningitis.",Anemia's a stretch. picks up his phone Page Dr. Wilson at 558.
Whites can get it.,Come on. We get the tennis elbow and all the money. Let them have sickle cell.
"He's right. House, Chase and Taub stare at her. What, you thought I wouldn't agree with him? Ever?","You didn't agree with him. That's why he dumped you. Oh, sorry. It was mutual."
"We're cool, okay? Nobody's angry, nobody's hurt.",Sounds passionate.
Not to me. What if he had a history of,"One big, happy family. TTP it is. Confirm with a blood smear and adamts13 antibodies."
SParkstocytes suggest TTP.,ducking to look through a door then moving on Good. Now what?
"Normally, we'd try plasmapheresis, but the Patient has an albumin colloid allergy.",So?
So that means we have to give him a splenectomy.,"Yes, it does."
"Yes, it does.",Wilson?
Wilson? No.,Do you know where he is?
You're sure you want us to take out his spleen.,Is that what a splenectomy is? I thought it was an ice cream treat. Yuck.
So you do really think he has TTP? You're not just testing us.,"Yeah, like I have time for games."
So why did you really take this case?,Isn't it obvious? I'm fishing for a dinner invite.
Isn't it obvious? I'm fishing for a dinner invite.,Missed you at breakfast this morning. And lunch.
I had a dentist appointment.,joining Wilson You know where Cuddy's sister lives?
You see. This is why I don't answer your urgent pages. Because they're not urgent pages.,I've decided what I'm gonna do about Cuddy and Lucas. I'm going to break them up.
I'm going to break them up. Of course.,"It's given me a purpose in life, a goal, a raison d'tre."
"Albeit a selfish, mean-spirited, Parkldish raison. He rings for the elevator.",Ehhhhh.
entering the elevator with House How you Manage to elevate your narcissism to beneficence is masterful.,"And I've decided to do it at Thanksgiving dinner. Just 'cause I'm sentimental. Dinner is at Cuddy's sister's, which brings us back"
"Dinner is at Cuddy's sister's, which brings us back House, don't.","I fished for an invite. Cuddy wasn't biting, so I'll have to crash."
I have no idea where Cuddy's sister lives.,Ask and thou shalt receive.
You can't honestly think I would help you with this.,"Not help me, help Cuddy, remember? If you don't get it, I'll be forced to use more nefarious methods."
Blood flow's restored. over his shoulder to House There appears to be no perManent damage.,"spitting a pencil from his mouth into his hand Good news is it turns out to be an exciting, action-packed thrill ride of a case after all."
Bad news is we took out his spleen for nothing.,"picks up the phone and dials Thank God he's still got his appendix and tonsils. So what looks like TTP, acts like TTP, tests like TTP, but isn't TTP?"
CT would've picked up something.,"Hi, I'm Greg House, a friend of your sister, Lisa."
Could be DIC.,Cuddy. Sorry. Wrong number. hangs up
I'm sure he's got a perfectly logical explanation.,Can't be DIC. No hemorrhaging. And I'm calling all 12 Julia Cuddys within a 100-mile radius.
to House Acquired pancytopenia. WBC's normal.,"on the phone again Hey, Julia. You're, uh you're Lisa's sister, right? You sure? 'Cause you are number 12."
Maybe she got married and changed her name. Otis Campbell.,hanging up PRobably kept her first name.
Standard tox screen. Unstandard toxins don't show up on it.,"Well, you two do an unstandard tox screen you two search his home. Otis Campbell's got to be hiding somewhere."
"Thank you, doctor, you've been wonderful.","As have you, Diana. Be well."
He's done six already.,Figured you might be getting backed up. The holiday season and all.
So which one of us slipped through the wormhole into an alternate dimension?,I have always loved to travel. And paint. Lucky number sEven.
"House... I know you're trying to be nice, but I also know you're doing it because you have an agenda.",Wow. Sexy and smart. Lucas is a lucky guy.
"The question is, is this a bad agenda or a good one? Either you're trying to screw with me, or you're trying to show me that you've really changed.",pause. exaggerated curiosity So which is it? I'm dying to know.
What are you doing for Thanksgiving dinner?,Peace in our time. It cost me 45 minutes of clinic duty. He hands the paper to Wilson.
This is a three-hour drive. Have you considered the possibility that this is a fake address?,You think she'd send me to a vacant lot for Thanksgiving dinner?
If she's smart.,She is. That's why I ran it through motor vehicles. Good as gold.
This cannot end well.,I don't want it to end well. You should come as my date. You're not gonna want to miss this.
What's with the ties?,Makes me look adorably non-threatening. Party brown and orange or party hearty white and tan?
Liver failure would explain all the symptoms. House gestures with one tie. Party.,"tossing the white and tan tie and putting the other one on So guy's a brainiac, and his secret drug of choice is booze?"
With pedestrian alcoholism. Liver biopsy can wait until after Thanksgiving.,"Yes, assuming the biopsy's gonna tell us exactly what we expect it to tell us, it can wait till after New Year's."
"On the other hand, Taub and Thirteen can do the liver biopsy today. Why us?",Juniority. Welcome back.
What do you want us to do?,Same as me. Have a Happy Thanksgiving.
"Here, we got this. String beans?",Julia?
Nice. Except now we have to stay and test his kidneys. She hands him his sandwich.,Key under the mat.
There's no key under the mat.,"Oh, right."
And you are?,Less wrong.
Less wrong. Ah.,Then I started thinking... long pause while Lucas waits What was I saying?
"You were saying it's late, and...",She invited me.
"How 'bout a cup of coffee? He heads for the kitchen. It's just instant, but...",I'm pathetic. I don't deserve her.
"Okay, okay, all right. Uh, here. Lucas comes over, grabs House under the arms and helps him onto the couch. He exhales loudly. House is draped across his lap. Maybe you should crash here. It's a sofa bed.",I love her.
What did you say to Lucas last night?,"I know there were a lot of consonants. He winces slightly. I don't remember how I got here, nEver mind what I said."
"Well, I just talked to him. And he said he thought it'd be better if we stopped seeing each other. Said he didn't realize how much there still was between you and me, and he didn't want to get caught in the middle of us.","I was drunk. WhatEver I said, he can't really"
"I've had enough, House. I actually felt bad about scamming you. But then you lived down to my expectations and then some. There is no us. There nEver will be.",It worked.
Please tell me you're talking about a medical procedure.,They split up this morning. You're the very first one I've told.
And you think she'll start dating you? I'm sure she hates you.,"But her eyes say, How will I Ever pay you for that tennis lesson?"
"sighs Ah, what a shame.",They'll get over it.
I meant for you.,I'll get over it faster than they do.
You're right. It's his fault because he's stupid.,pause He certainly is.
pause He certainly is.,You're stupid.
"Well, I'm rubber, and you're glue.","He's not pedestrian, he's stupid. At least stupider than he should be. He's a DXM junkie."
Dextromethorphan. As in cough syrup?,"He wasn't taking it for his cough. It's cheap, available at your corner drug store, and taken in high doses, it's a dumb drug."
"Dumb drug. Well, he obviously hasn't",He's smart compared to you.
I thought that I did that. You do.,Long-term abuse of DXM explains all your symptoms.
I don't think I can live without it.,You'd be surprised what you can live without. Make him a genius.
"No. That's the pRoblem. I'm the one who's a jerk. But I owe her Everything. I want to want to be with her. And when I'm clear, I... I can't.","Fainting, dizziness, shortness of breath?"
Sometimes. Is the wait always this long?,"Only on days that end in day. Diarrhea, weight loss?"
A bit. Don't you Ever shave?,"Yeah. once a week. How 'bout you? Stomach pain, tenderness?"
Every now and then. Are you this rude to all your Patients?,"Oh, yes! Don't think you're special. So we've got a lot of vague, unverifiable symptoms. Yet all the physical signs are perfectly normal."
What do you think I have?,"I'm not sure, but I think it's... a lame job."
a lame job. What?,You're a rat. Insurance company sends you out to check on the quality of medical care.
Insurance company sends you out to check on the quality of medical care. That's ridiculous.,Is it really?
You're an ass.,Put it in your report. I tell you what. I'll give you 20 bucks if you'll pretend that I'm not when we leave this room.
Put it in your report. I tell you what. I'll give you 20 bucks if you'll pretend that I'm not when we leave this room.,"Remember, first ice, then heat. If you have any pRoblems, don't hesitate to call me."
"Thank you, Dr. House.",Wait a second. Where's Cuddy?
Gone for the day.,"He sees Ronnie leaving. Hey, hey, hey! She runs for the outer door. Sorry. I can't remember if I've mocked you yet for being a male nurse."
I think this counts.,Fair enough. He leaves.
"Vitamin B12 deficiency? Gives us anemia, numbness.",Not a stroke.
If he has a vascular malformation Anemia's not macrocytic.,Sorry to inconvenience you. Dying Patients can be so thoughtless.
Dying Patients can be so thoughtless. Don't.,"Great comeback. Is that Oscar Wilde? Come on, people."

Wouldn't produce sParkstocytes. Lupus.,"Gee, thanks for coming in. ANA was negative. to Chase What about you? Got any predictable drivel you'd like to add?"
I think they've given you enough already.,"Well, at least they're trying. They're not just sitting there like roadkill. Give me something. Give me something, or I'll get your ex-smarter half on the phone and ask her."
You're gonna be pressing charges?,Against the ottoMan I tripped over?
Against the ottoMan I tripped over? Against Chase.,I'm pretty sure the ottoMan was acting alone. You free for dinner this weekend?
At least three other people saw him do it.,Mass hysteria. Either night?
I can't have doctors punParkng each other out.,"Oh, my God, who got punched?"
"And more importantly, for Chase's sake, I need to know if he's able to handle himself or if I should be getting him some help.","Chase couldn't have punched anyone. He was with me when I tripped over the ottoMan. If you're not planning on eating this weekend, maybe a movie?"
"I'm not doing this, House. It's not fun anymore. Just do your job.",I need your help.
What happened to your face?,"I was mowing the lawn when the phone rang. You're a computer. I'm gonna feed you data, and you analyze it."
"What, are you gonna feed me 20 years of medical knowledge too? It's not gonna work.",I know. But I don't have anyone else to ask.
"It's lonely, isn't it?",It's not that bad.
Then you're not that smart. You Ever tried to kill yourself?,Not quickly.
"I did. 12 years ago I jumped off the top of my eight-story building into a dumpster bin the day before pickup. I broke my collarbone, my leg, and three ribs. When I was in the hospital they put me on narcotics and suddenly Everything was just better. I didn't feel isolated or lonely. That's where I met my wife. She was so happy. And dumb. And I was... smart... and miserable. You tell me who the genius is. I fell in love with her buzzed out of my head, and I knew I wanted to stay that way forEver.",Enjoy.
chuckles Easier on your conscience if I die an idiot?,"What's a conscience? He starts to leave, then turns back. Which ribs... did you break in the fall? They on the left side?"
Ferrous oxide contrast?,"Gets absorbed by the spleen. Unless he doesn't have one. In which case it's absorbed by the liver, and fries that."
You think I opened him up and didn't take out his spleen?,All organs do look kind of the same red and squishy.
"Okay, that is amazing.","12 years, eight stories, and a dumpster ago, he broke three ribs, damaged his spleen."
So it is TTP. I just didn't remove... all of his spleens.,16 splenectomies. Pretty sure he gets a set of steak knives with that.
"I can outrun you. House stops and turns toward Chase. Sorry about the nose. And the eye. And the, uh... eyebrow.",Guess I deserved it.
"Well, if I thought that, I wouldn't be apologizing.",Your fist slipped?
"Everybody kept bugging me, asking if I was okay.",So you busted my nose to keep people off your back.
wincing then admitting it Pretty much.,Making people Even more worried about you.
Maybe. But at least they're not talking to me about it.,slight nod Fair enough.
Cheers. Thank you.,Don't be so grateful. You'll be delivering packages for 70 years to pay for it.
"Well, uh, thanks for our talk. It's been a while since I had a stimulating conversation.",So what're you gonna do?
"Well, she doesn't have to know. It's worked for 12 years.",standing Tell your brain I said good-bye.
"Einstein is giving himself a lobotomy, and you're cool with that?",Ignorance is bliss.
staring at the picture Wow.,rising Dr. Cuddy. Can we at least be civil?
How's your nose?,It's okay. Does your kid like animals? I got tickets to that holiday carnival. I hear they have a nice petting zoo.
I think I was pretty clear before.,I don't mean with me. Here. Take 'em. Enjoy.
"Enjoy. No, thanks.",They're not fake.
looking pained. I don't want them.,Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.,They didn't split up. She wouldn't take the tickets.
"Of course. Windtalker code for we nEver split up. House, she told you multiple times she wants nothing to do with you.","I wasn't gonna be there. She just felt guilty that I felt guilty, so she couldn't take them."
Either that or she didn't want to appease you.,"These weren't reparations. Just a simple gesture of remorse, and she slapped it down. They didn't break up. She just wanted me to think that so I'd back off."
Dare I ask what you're gonna do?,Nothing. I said they'd either break up or they'd stay together. They didn't break up.
And you're okay with that?,It is what it is.
Good for you.,pulling the bandaid off Aah.
Oh. How the...,"singing Well, I guess it would be nice, if I could touch your body, I know not Everybody has got a body like you. Baaby."
"You know, most people go for the hardwood or carpeting. I think guitars and garbage work just as well.",Got the urge to play last night. Had to go all the way back to my apartment. Thought I'd save on future trips.
Hmm. That's very eco-friendly of you. How about keeping down on the noise pollution?,looking at his watch 633. You should be flossing by now.
"Wilson holds out his hands to stop House from commenting, then turns to go back into his bedroom After I sleep in. Ah. Ah.",Is it that time of year again? He's a self-important jerk.
He's my friend.,He's a self-important jerk.
clearly annoyed Seems to be what I'm attracted to.,Guy calls you Jim. Doesn't Even know your name.
proudly I just had a House moment. Diagnosed Transverse Myelitis from a cold sore. How cool is that? Patients really eat that crap up.,It's why I'm loved. to Chase and Thirteen What am I doing here?
Ultrasound is clear.,"Which means he's definitely not pregnant, right?"
"groaning I'm joining you, Antonio Aguilar. We'll play in God's MariaPark band.","Draw some blood. to Wilson, but not looking up from his phone The self-important jerk does not have Transverse Myelitis. He's got cancer."
How do you Even--,closing his phone and finally looking up at Wilson Okay.
to Thirteen How long does a simple blood draw take? Almost finished.,"Well, when you're finished almost finishing it, test it."
He spilled my blood. Confusion. Delirium.,Why rule out the hand of God so fast?
Why rule out the hand of God so fast?,to Wilson Your guy's low white count and right arm paralysis equals a recurrence of his leukemia. Simple math.
Did you look past the first page of the file? No AML cells anywhere. I did the blood smears myself.,It's still cancer. You know how I know? He's got an oncologist for a doctor.
And your magical leukemia detector is more powerful than a flow cytometer?,"I look for zebras because other doctors rule out all the horses. In this case, you are those other doctors. You haven't earned a zebra. 100 bucks."
Are you serious?,"standing up Look, friends don't diagnose friends with cancer."
"standing up Look, friends don't diagnose friends with cancer. I get it. Your pRoblem is you're not objective. Your caring is clouding your diagnosis. Just cut that out and you could be a pretty decent doctor.",to Thirteen Just give me the lactic acid lEvel.
to Thirteen Just give me the lactic acid lEvel. 27,House nods and goes over to Juan The fact that you can't speak English is not an excuse for you not being humiliated by what I'm about to say.
"I happen to be a sleep specialist. Thanks, Doc.",Hey. Can a guy get a little privacy?
Nice hiding spot.,"Actually, it's perfect. It allows me to hide from Cuddy and find you. What did she want?"
She was checking up on Tucker thanks to you.,That's it?
Like what? Something about you? Something you could interpret as being about you? An anagram maybe? It'd be great if you could play hide and seek somewhere else. My Patient--,No pRoblem. Just give me the 100 bucks you owe me and I'm gone.
Tucker doesn't have cancer.,"He doesn't have a ball of fungus in his lungs either. Next time you want to use my team, I suggest you at least leave a tip."
There's nothing to talk about.,pushing the intercom button with his cane and speaking to Chase Why are you doing surgery when I need you finding me a new case?
looking up at House from the OR You don't want a new case.,"Oh, right."
"Yes, you're fine with them dating. But moving in together is a whole other lEvel of commitment.","scoffing This is the 21st century, Wilson."
"Oh, for God's sake, House, don't do this to yourself. It's a loft. It has no deeper meaning than open-space living arrangement.",If you bought into her diatribe about rediscovering her lost city girl roots. And two bedrooms. It just reeks of commitment issues.
Yeah. Or she has a baby.,This is classic mid-life Cuddy crisis. This is her version of a two-seat convertible.
"looking up at them Wilson, he's got global lung damage. Means it's not fungal. It's PCP pneumonia.",Hmm.
Thanks. The treatment indiCate--,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were in the middle of something."
"It's a conference room, with glass walls. You thought I'd be alone?",Your Patient has cancer.
Coming through. House got a new case.,"stopping to hand Wilson a piece of paper Revised OR schedule. Sorry, Wilson, had to bump you. It's not like your guy's bleeding out of his eyes."
"House, your guy's not bleeding out of his eyes either.",The nurse who books the OR thinks he is.
Your case is no more urgent than mine.,"pushing through the doors of the surgical suite Yeah, but you're way more Patient."
So I'm in the 10% that don't get cured. Maybe not.,We just removed a screw from a guy's lung. And the weird thing is he didn't get better. Any idea what that means?
It means you're not listening to me.,No. It means I'm ignoring you to make a point. There is a difference.
The pRoblem with that technique is I have no idea what point you're making.,"That your idea is implicitly not worth responding to. Doubling your Patient's chemo dose is stupid. Damn, now it's explicit."
It could swamp out the resistance of the cancer cells.,The fact that it theoretically should work doesn't make it any less stupid.
Of course it does. It's exactly what you would do.,I'm me. You're you.
And a table is a table.,"And chemo is poison. And double chemo is double poison. And I can handle it when things go wrong. You can't. And things could go very,"
"Either way, he's dead. House enters the lab We can't stop the oozing.",Don't care. I'm here because looking at his watch it's 115 and Wilson started testing at 1245. Which means...
turning to face House He needs a new liver.,Look on the bright side. You can publish the results of this case study. No one will Ever double the dose again.
"I'm sorry, Mel. You and Emily don't match Tuck's blood type. And neither does Ashley. So a live liver donation is out. The best thing to do is just what you've been doing. Be together.",Hope he already told you that you're gonna die. 'Cause it's gonna make what I'm about to say a lot more relevant.
"House, I know it's raining out there in the hallway, but","I was just in the ER, testing my Patient for autonomic dysfunction."
Motorcycle versus semi. How bad?,Bad for the motorcycle. Good for your liver. Blood type's a match.
Why wasn't I paged?,Because there's a pRoblem. No organ donor card. Dead guy's sister
Where is she?,20 minutes away. House and Wilson rush out of the room
"How do you get the call that your brother's dead and then run out the door? Oh--oh--oh, that reminds me, I-I had dry cleaning to pick up.",Did Cuddy buy the place?
Not yet. You okay?,Just making conversation. Yours was getting boring.
What are you planning?,I'm not planning anything.
And I don't beliEve you. How are you gonna punish her for dating Lucas?,"Okay, now this conversation is getting boring."
Are you really okay?,loudly No! I am not okay. Not Even close.
"Wow. Okay. See, that's very adult of you.","No, it isn't. It's just me accepting the fact that there's nothing I can do and moving on."
"Which is, I think, the definition of adulthood.","Well, if it is, being a kid is a lot more fun."
"Well, if it is, being a kid is a lot more fun.",Showtime. He gets out of the car and he and Wilson walk up the driveway
trying not to sound too desperate It will save my Patient's life.,approaParkng Aikoa What if I told you that he wasn't dead?
Are you saying my brother is still alive?,I'm saying you're being an idiot.
Then I'm not defiling a dead body. interrupting House.,The last generous act of a living person.
"interrupting again House, it's too late. The liver's started to degrade. It's no longer viable for transplant.",Well played. Religion just killed another person.
"Tucker, it's... I can't.",Late night with the Pigeon sisters?
I'll nEver betray the secret of the bushido of the heel,Someone's cranky. looking at his watch And late. Where were you?
going into the kitchen getting a drink. What--why are all my frozen dinners thawing on the counter?,I needed room for my margarita jello shots. I used test tubes as bottles so they'll be shaped like my cane.
I needed room for my margarita jello shots. I used test tubes as bottles so they'll be shaped like my cane.,Why'd you go out drinking alone when you got such great company here?
He leans on the doorway and pauses Tucker wants me to donate a lobe of my liver to him.,And you were out drinking. So you're actually considering this?
Yeah. I was out marinating my liver in alcohol to get it ready for the transplant. Yeah.,"standing up Your mouth says no, but your pathetic attempt at a deflection has guilt written all over it."
It's my fault. It is my fault! I gave him too much chemo.,You cured his cancer.
And killed him in the process.,Quibbles.
And killed him in the process. Quibbles.,He's had a predictable complication. Surprise. Bad things happen to people who are sick. Doesn't make you responsible.
"Oh, no--not legally. Ethically. Ethically!","A table is a table. Don't be a doormat, Wilson."
Call me a doormat-- get it all out of your system-- but I'm doing it.,rising Why?
He's my friend.,I'm your friend. All the pain pills I've taken. What if I need your liver?
Right. How selfish of me not to have considered your possible future needs.,They're all dying. They're all your friends.
"I'm not here for an argument, House.","No, right, that's room 12A. So why are you here? Want to make sure that I've called the moving van?"
"No. The operation is in two hours, and I'd like you to be there with me.",No.
No. What-- why?,"looking Wilson right in the eye and sounding emotionally vulnerable Because if you die, I'm alone. He looks away and sits back down behind his desk, rubbing his leg"
"wheeling himself out Actually, it's James.",taking off his glasses and putting them in his shirt pocket You ready to admit that he's a self-important jerk?
I still feel good about what I did.,You don't feel angry?
Ah. I'm a little disappointed.,Disappointment is anger for wimps. You don't have to be so gentle about Everything. It's okay to get angry once in a while.
You can't change a table.,"Actually, you can. Just need a coat of paint and the guts to use it."
Bonnie told me what Cuddy bid.,You're gonna outbid her?
wandering over to the kitchen area We do need a bigger refrigerator. She hurt my friend. She should be punished.,You got mad. I'm proud of you. Cuddy won't share that sentiment. How are you gonna explain it to her?
I'm changing our address to a P.O. box.,looking around at the fireplace and the large windows She'll find out Eventually.
Bonnie. I'll take it.,Baby steps.
We almost done here?,"Assuming you did this shaving your forehead... Okay, then. I'm ordering a head C.T."
You gotta stay here. We'll straighten out that mess with Marco tomorrow. Let the doc do his job.,"Actually, stitParkng you up is really the E.R. doc's job."
Yeah. Too long of a wait.,Yeah.
"All right, Eddie. Come on, let's go.","I don't care what you guys are into. If you don't get this checked out, it'll happen again."
Whoa. What will?,This.
This. He slams his cane against the paper-covered exam table. It makes an explosively loud crack sound. Mickey and Eddie stare at House for a seconds then Mickey crumples to the floor. House peers over the exam table at him. Cool.,"32-year-old Man, recent dEveloped loud-noise-induced vertigo."
This guy strained his back three years ago. And that's it. All the rest of these pages are blank.,"Yes, he won't tell us anything. Understandable, since he's a drug dealer."
He actually said he was a drug dealer?,Not out loud.
"sitting back down It doesn't matter if this guy's a drug dealer or not. Noise-induced vertigo means ear or brain. Head C.T. was clean, so I'm thinking acoustic neuroma. We need to do an A.B.R. to test his hearing.",Acoustic neuroma fits. So does lidocaine toxicity. Or benzocaine depends what he's cutting the coke with.
"So now he's not just a drug dealer, he's a cocaine dealer.",He seemed peppy. You test his ears. I'm gonna go test his cocaine.
You think this guy's just gonna hand over a briefcase full of illegal drugs because you ask nicely?,I hope not.
"I make that much money. He turns to give the paper back to Foreman and sees his face. And... apparently, you don't.",I need the drugs.
We're in textiles.,"screams, his face furrowing down the center in a very good imitation of Sabretooth from X-men I need the drugs! Hmm... works for Jack Bauer."
Is this really necessary? The chairs in the hall are way more comfortable.,But way less genre-appropriate.
I wish I could tell ya.,"Okay... Well, let's work with that. Forget the drugs. Let's talk about textiles. What's your major product? Is it h? And by that I mean hosiery."
We do more with... culottes.,Is that with a c or a k?
C. Nobody wants k anymore.,Does your friend cut the fabric?
"No, he's a sales guy.","Well, he must cut a culotte here and there."

Any chance I could get some water over here?,"If only there was some way to communiCate that information to her. Perhaps using, I don't know, sounds. If only the larynx was capable of"
She didn't beliEve me. She sidestepped my dinner invite.,And a Woman would only reject you because she's worried that you might not be interested in her.
"We were chatting, having fun. There was definitely a sPark.","When she thought you were gay. to EddieYou sure your friend isn't secretly tr turns back to Wilson What is a culotte, anyway?"
Mickey hates the stuff. He's one of the few guys I trust to watch the product overnight. They took him away an hour ago. You think he's okay?,It's an ear test. Pretty sure he'll live.
Which means we can stop the bloodhound gang routine and go back to being doctors.,whining But we're doctors all the time. It's so boring. speaking normally Fine.
"Thought I'd give myself a little treat. What if it's not his brain, but it's on the way to his brain? Carotid stenosis.",Get an ultrasound of his carotids. See if his arteries are clogged.
You bugged his room?,"Our Patient sleeps in the building where they keep their stash. Eventually, he'll say something that gives away where that is. And we'll find out what's making him sick."
But we ruled out environmental causes.,You ruled out environmental causes.
"And you pretended to agree, just so we'd take him out of his room so you could plant the bug.",Carotid stenosis was a decent idea. But an Even decent-er idea is that he's got toxins stored in his fat cells. Every calorie he burns makes him sicker.
Bug's a better idea than blindly running tests for days.,Tell him it'll take weeks. It'll be faster.
He's gonna get away. Shut up.,"3-B? You're Nora, right? My roommate tells me you're the one to thank for all the tips about the neighborhood. Greg."
Nice to meet you.,"I hear you thought that Wilson and I liked to polish each other's swords. And by swords, I mean pistols."
Of course he told you about that.,"Oh, don't worry."
Would you would you help me get this upstairs? Absolutely.,"Nice shoes, by the way. Louboutin?"
"Patient went out, came back worse than before. Points us back to environmental, tied to wherEver he went.","No, it doesn't. Where's Foreman?"
"What do you mean, No, it doesn't? We screwed up the tail. My car was impounded.","True, amusing, and irrelevant. Foreman fall for the paycheck thing?"
"Foreman fall for the paycheck thing? Uh, yeah.",Mazel tov. Should be fun to watch.
You're off environmental?,"WherEver he went, it wasn't for long enough."
I ran into Nora this morning. She told me about your Evita listening party.,The London and New York recordings are so different.
You were supposed to tell her that we're straight.,"She didn't beliEve me, either."
smiling You're doing this to mess with me.,Correction I started doing this to mess with you. Now I'm honestly trying to hit that.
By pretending you're gay and in a relationship with me?,standing We're in a relationship and we're really unhappy.
I can't decide if this plan is more despicable or illogical.,"Then, one night, we get drunk... back rub turns into a front rub... The next morning, I've nEver felt this way about a Woman before."
That's... quite a commitment you've made to jumping the girl I'd like to date.,I'd like to date her. In the sense that I'd like to jump her repeatedly.
I saw her first.,Seriously? You're invoking the guy code?
We're guys. It's a code.,You're only bringing this up 'cause you know you're gonna lose.
"It's not an infection, but it might be an autonomic nerve disorder.",The hair is still bumping me. Did you get it cut because you're ready for the next chapter or

You have a heart pRoblem?,"Medically, no. He would have told us about that. Metaphorically..."
"It's an effect from operating outside of the law. Sometimes, I have to do bad things. And not always to bad people. Last few months, that hasn't been so easy. A guy got me the pills. House nods. And they control the stress. Look, don't don't say anything to Eddie. All right? The last thing I need is the guys thinking that I've gone soft.",When was your last pill before we originally admitted you?
"Um, the night before.","And we stuck you in here, and you went into beta blocker withdrawal."
!and stress. He's been in this game for a while. Either he grew a conscience over the last few months or he's producing excess adrenaline.,Pheochromocytoma.
Pheochromocytoma. What?,"It's Greek for, You'll be back doing bad things to good people in no time."
"muting the TV Hi, James. We've got some kung pao left. arParkng her back as House finds a knot Oh! God. Right there. Oh. Oh.",We're having a picnic... with wine.
I'll pour you a glass.,He doesn't drink.
And environmental is back at the top of our list of suspects. We're trying to narrow down the possibilities.,to Thirteen That receiver doesn't respond to Manual stimulation. Maybe if you took off your shirt.
Most buildings there were built between 1920 and 1940. We're compiling a list of toxins most common,There's got to be at least one open frequency.

I'll check out the cafeteria.,dropping the glove on the bed Why the beta blockers?
What do you mean?,Valium and Xanax actually reduce stress. Beta blockers just control the symptoms of stress.
Beta blockers just control the symptoms of stress. Whoa.,"Keep the heart from racing, hands from shaking, and all those stage fright issues. That's why some people take them when they perform."
What the hell is that?,This is my bug. He puts it in his pocket. And this... reaParkng between the pillows on the bed
reaParkng between the pillows on the bed Um...,This... This is yours. He pulls out another one.
You bugged your own room? Are you... an inforMant?,An inforMant would have sold his pals out to us at the first sign of a sniffle. This guy... is a cop.
I don't see how this is relevant.,"In the land of no fun, you got a really sensible piece of property."
Give him a break. Knowing this guy's an undercover cop doesn't get us any closer to curing him.,Good point. You know what they say. Information is not power. Wait...
You're saying we should use the cop thing to force him to talk?,Force? I'm talking about the Womanly art of persuasion. She starts toward the room. I said Womanly.
"Any more clots keep forming, he may not last 24 hours.",And the moron still won't talk.
"Bad guy, cool good guy, moron?",Pretty much.
Guy's a hero. He's risking his life to put these dealers in jail.,I'm sure the dealers who take their places will be very grateful.
Except that treating for Everything could kill him faster than whatEver's killing him.,Got a better idea?
"Yeah, private party, Man. Uh... I got it covered tonight. After a moment, the guy walks off, giving Eddie the thumbs up. Eddie turns to Thirteen. Nice.",The jealousy is... killing me.
Well... he clearly cares about you. Very much.,Why can't he show it in a in a normal way?
Come stay at my place.,Really?
"Mm-hmm. It'll be fun. You know, like a like a sleepover.",That would that would be... It would be such a help. Thank you.
Thank you. House.,What are you doing here?
I'm here because...,Nothing you can say is going to change anything.
"I love this Man. And I am not wasting another moment of my life denying that. He pulls something out of his overcoat pocket and kneels down next to the table. The something is a ring box, which he opens. Gregory House... will you marry me?",Wow. This is unexpected.
I'm gonna go.,"No no, no, no."
"I didn't see any fungus at the location, and none of the samples",Looks like somebody missed something. Which is embarrassing for somebody.
"And... the steroids we gave him would have suppressed his immune system. If that was a fungus, he'd have 30 aneurysms.",Somebody's got a good point.
We need to start him on antifungal meds before he drowns in his own blood.,staring at the scans Do it.
sticking her head in Want to grab some coffee?,Kind of a bad time.
"Sorry. Uh, you told me to drop by, so... This is when I could make it.",Right.
So you were only spending time with me to screw with him?,"God, no."
"Well, it's really... It's sweet of you to stick up for your friend like that. She looks at his face. And you're still trying to sleep with me. You know, maybe I will call him. It would serve you right.",Wilson's a jerk too.
"Well, at least he tried to do the right thing.","He's been divorced three times. He slept with a dying Patient. Sure, he looks like a boy scout, but then..."
"He's been divorced three times. He slept with a dying Patient. Sure, he looks like a boy scout, but then...","The aneurysms look mycotic, but they're not."
Are you sure?,"If you die in the next day or so, I will be."
I'm sorry about your Patient.,He died a hero in his own mind. Guess it's better than nothing.
Ran into Nora in the elevator. She no longer thinks we're gay. Now she thinks we're mendacious dirt bags.,Mendacious dirt bag comes much more naturally to me. Least we can get rid of that. He gestures at the A Chorus Line poster.
I kind of like it. House stares at him. Unlike this sofa.,It's 500 bucks. And... he pulls a lEver on the side it reclines.
takes a deep breath and sings,I will punch you in the face.
"I'll stop, if you get rid of the sofa.",glares at him No chance.
"27 year old female intense, intermittent ear pains, saw six doctors!",Tell her to stop lurking in the front row. If she wants to hit on musicians that's what tour buses are for. Next.
If I ask why were in Wilson's office is there any chance I'll get a straight answer?,Try it. Try it.
"14-year-old boy, joint pain and excess hair growth.","Tell him to masturbate, no more than 3 times daily. With meals. Next."
Did I mention that the 27-year-old female is really hot. And her husband is really not!,"Wild guess, he's rich."
Not unless social workers have begun pulling in the big money recently.,holding out his hand Gimme...
You're taking the case because she's hot?,"No, that would be an accident of genetics."
"Or... She, you know, loves her husband.",reading the file She loves something about him.
"To a healthier diet, raw foods, lots of nuts.","It's not the ear, it's the heart. Her protein is cheese, which can raise cholesterol. Hers was already elevated. Gave her arterial blockages."
Cardiac arrhythmia presenting as ear pain. Very rare. Cool.,"So, beauty and the beast. He hands the file back to Chase Who wants to go see? House's phone rings"
sighing You can't sleep in your own office? Or bedroom for that matter?,rolling over Got to avoid my natural habitat. Some idiot I went to med school with keeps leaving messages and wants to drop by for lunch.
So tell him no.,It's compliCated.
"It's too compliCated for you to tell someone you don't like, to screw off? That's practically your hobby.",A few months ago he was... sort of part of my therapy. My shrink told me to write a letter of apology to someone I hurt.
taking off his coat and putting on a labcoat And how did you hurt him?,We were in a seminar on flatworm genetics. I switched my final paper with his.
You plagiarized? Doesn't sound like you.,I was testing a theory.
"So you're in this mental hospital, delving into your subconscious, and this is who you choose to apologize to?",Yep. Lorenzo Wibberly.
Of all the people in the world you've hurt?,Not Everyone has a name that's so easy to find in the white pages.
"Um... I'm in there, and so is Cuddy.","Yeah. And yet, I picked him. It's funny, isn't it?"
"grabbing a Patient file and heading for the door Yes, it's hilarious. Great to see what a success your therapy was. He leaves, closing the door behind him",loudly We said we'd nEver go to sleep angry.
Where are you?,Undisclosed location.
Who are you hiding from?,looking at two framed photos on the coffee table Wilson.
That's great. A co-worker confronted our Patient. Altered mental status. Basically accused her of poisoning him. We think he was projecting.,So he's poisoning her.
What could he get his hands on to cause supraventricular tachycardia?,"riffling through Cuddy's desk drawers Does he have dry skin? Thin eyebrows? If you're sharing an amazed look, please do it louder."
He might have. How did you know that?,"If he has hypothyroidism and he dumped his meds in her coffee, that would make her heart go boom."
"Because she's a successful, happily married consultant, and he's a crazy, drunk weirdo who we just tossed out of the hospital.",taking the other photo out of its frame And she's hot.
You don't think it's suspicious she didn't Even mention it to her husband?,"Yeah, Foreman. Why did you break up with Thirteen? Oh, no, wait, the non-subtextual thing she was saying, why that?"
"This is about the case, not some imaginary issue that you think Foreman and I have.","Great, start her on beta blockers."
Greg? Lorenzo Wibberly. Dr. Wilson said you'd be here. How ya been?,"to himself Check, and mate."
"Look... I'm sorry this is awkward or whatEver. I just thought it was nice of you to write that letter, and I wanted to tell you that you don't have to feel bad.",looking uncomfortable Thanks. So where are you working these days? You got your own practice or you at a hospital?
"I thought you knew. Dani's, the organic supermarket chain.",As an in House doctor?
"I actually nEver got licensed. I didn't graduate med school. I planned on going back, and then my father got sick and I had to take care of him and had some bad luck.",Why didn't you graduate?
I was one credit short. And I was sort of already on academic pRobation. So...,almost afraid to ask Which credit?
"I got a, uh... He failed me on that paper you switched. I thought you knew.",hopefully So I'm guessing you're the CEO of this supermarket chain?
Why do you want to meet her so badly?,Psychopaths always fascinate me. I think it's their cultural literacy and strong family values. Or is that Jews?
We're not gonna be able to get an honest read on her unless we figure out a way to get the husband out of there.,Hmm. I got an idea. to Bill Can you get out of here? Thanks. Bill leaves. House looks at Foreman It was the thanks that did it.
Hmm. I got an idea. to Bill Can you get out of here? Thanks. Bill leaves. House looks at Foreman It was the thanks that did it.,"to Valerie Hi, I'm Dr. House. How long have you been a psychopath?"
Are you saying I'm like Ted Bundy or something?,Psychopathy can get a bad rap.
to Thirteen Is that why you were asking me all those weird questions?,"Yeah though you have Darwin to thank for that. She got the creeps around you. Which oddly, is an actual medical phenomenon around psychopaths. PRobably an evolved response to predators."
"I'm sorry, you're really freaking me out. I have no idea what",Relax.
No. I gave him a little valium and an emetic.,You sure you understand what the word no means?
Same thing you get out of your job. Bill has a trust fund. And I have a prenup his parents made me sign.,Told you he was rich. She's not that weird.
She kind of reminds me of someone I know.,Tell me about it. Some of my co-workers will insult people right to their faces. How long have you been this way?
Just how I am. Are you gonna cure my heart pRoblems now?,So psychopathy plus cardiac arrhythmia. Go.
I thought you were bluffing to get information. You really think they're connected?,"Two rare conditions in one Patient, it's a fair assumption they are."
Psychopathy is generally just genetic. Nothing you can do about it. Something that hits 30 years after birth isn't gonna be connected.,Her disease isn't gonna lie dorMant that long. Did her heart warp her brain?
Maybe a handful of diseases.,It'll be super awesome when we find it. He stops in front of the elevator and pushes the button
Tertiary syphilis can cause pseudopsychopathic syndrome and cardiomyopathy.,"Fits best. Start her on penicillin, and rule out Wilson's and Hashimoto's. There's your handful. Wasn't so hard, was it?"
You've gotta do something about Thirteen. She flouted both my authority and yours.,"Yes, and she got it right and you got it wrong."
Which just aggravates the pRoblem. She'll do it again. Next time it won't work out so well. You gotta punish her.,"You're her boss. In some vague, nEver to be usefully defined way. You punish her."
"I'm also her ex, which, as you know, makes it a little compliCated.",The fact that you also fired her takes it from a little compliCated to a little moronic.
It was the only way I could,It wasn't because you were too in love with her.
You cut up my only copy of that photo.,That rare daguerreotype. You can charge me for the effort it takes to search your hard drive for a new copy.
she follows House to the door of an exam room Not the one of me and Lucas. The one from Ecuador.,Right. I had forgotten your deep emotional attachment to lemurs.
To my dad.,You got his tail?
He was holding the camera. That was the last trip we Ever took together. And I don't have a digital copy.,"Well, I could stand here all day apologizing, but I'd rather expiate my sins with good clean work."

You know... It's a job. I don't need to take any work home with me at least.,Free time... Wouldn't have any of that if you were a doctor.
Yeah. True. You like Parkli? I could reheat some.,looking out the sliding glass doors at the back of the House Is that your yard? That's nice.
"Yeah. That sugar maple, 100 - 150 years old. Most beautiful leaves in the fall. Sitting underneath on the bench It's like paradise.","I don't have a yard, myself. You got a good thing going."

I don't know what happened.,"looking at a lab report and then putting it down on the table Neither do I, but I know what happened after."
"reading the lab report that House put down Actually, he backed you up because of the new B.U.N. creatinine numbers. Brittle bones were from kidney failure.","There is that. So, heart and kidneys."
"So, heart and kidneys. And brain.","Nope, psychopathy is not a symptom."
It was yesterday.,"In the meantime, kidney failure ruled out syphilis and testing ruled out the other ideas that would've fit."
"Protein lEvels, kidneys, arrhythmia. Could be paraneoplastic. I'd say lymphoma.",Get her to radiotherapy.
Then how about partially accurate?,"Those of you who haven't slept together, you can go. Everyone else, stay behind."
"Oh. Sorry. to Thirteen That was our secret, right? He leaves",to Foreman and Thirteen Go have sex.

"From what I hear, you nEver visit Patients. And now, you've come to chat with me twice.",I want to know how you like being a Management consultant. I'm thinking of getting into it. That or psychopathy maybe. Which pays better?
I think you're already into one of them. Dr. Hadley made a joke yesterday. She said I sound like you.,I'm sure you understand what joke means.
"So you're not just out for yourself? For example, you would nEver interrupt a sick Woman's treatment just because of some personal obsession?",Of course I'm self-interested. We all are. We're born that way. The rest of us are born with consciences.
Which is something you just sound ecstatic about.,I'm not saying it's logical. I'm just saying it's huMan.
I'd give her a day. Two days at the most.,"Great. You be the clock. Everyone else will be the doctors. Heart, kidneys, now liver."

No one's gonna risk their life to save hers.,"Man, one false accusation from a psychopath, and you turned out to be a real bummer. I'm gonna go see if Wilson has any liver left."
entering the office What are you doing?,Paying Wibberly's mortgage for a few months. He rips the check out of the book Congratulations on another successful round of hectoring.
"Wait a minute, is that actually a check for him?",No. It's a giant novelty item for winning the lottery. You're just standing really far away.
"Of all the people to go the extra mile for, why this guy?",putting the check in an envelope I don't know. He just kinda smells good and makes me laugh.
Why not Cuddy? You nEver apologized after you defaced her photo.,Maybe because I recognize that sending someone to the poorHouse is a little more serious than editing a snapshot.
"No, it's because Cuddy actually means something to you, which makes it much harder to apologize.","addressing the envelope Oy. If it will make you shut up, I will tell her I'm sorry about the photo."
"Forget the photo. House, she was in love with you. House licks and seals the envelope And all she got in return was abuse. For years you toyed with her emotions.",She wasn't in love with me.
The fact that you still can't admit it just proves my point.,"fed up, and leaning back in his chair What do you want? Helping the guy was your idea."
"No, help the guy, whatEver... I'm just pointing out that it's much easier to soothe your guilt by throwing money at a stranger than by making amends to a person you actually care about.",You had me at much easier.
"We were wrong. Psychopathy is a symptom. I spoke to her sister. She wasn't always like this. She changed, and right around adolescence.","So liver, heart, brain, can lie dorMant, and, it starts at puberty."
We ruled that out. No keyser-fleischer rings.,There is one other sign. I know there are lipstick lesbians. Are there nail polish remover bisexuals?

Her fingernail's blue?,Yep. to Thirteen start her on chelation.
You're really doing this for me?,Tax shelter. I'll take some of that Parkli now.
holding the check I can't accept this.,"Fine. Forget the Parkli. Bye, Wibberly. House stands up to leave"

The negative test at least means steroids is less likely. We should discuss other possibilities.,Why? He injects his sore ankles with lidocaine Every game. You think he's above injecting steroids?
Could cause the excess hormones that could cause the rage and would elude the ER Steroid test.,Fine.

"When you read that book, you were hoping that somewhere, underneath all that talk of God, there would be a way of thinking, a mind that you could recognize. You wanted what we all want.",The power to transform into any water-based object?
To look across the gulf and know there's someone else like you. At least tell me this did you find something there?,Underneath the God stuff... More God stuff.
Would you mind at least putting a napkin under your jelly toast?,"Get a table, and I won't eat it on the couch."
"putting on his overcoat Yes, you will.",But I won't have a good excuse.
Why don't you go get a table?,Not my condo.
You have my permission. Pick out whatEver you want.,"Then it would be a reflection of me, not you. That wouldn't be right."
"He picks his keys off the counter and packs his briefcase No, it would be a reflection of the fact that the guy who's been mooParkng off of me for as long as I can remember, isn't a complete ingrate.",pausing You've nEver furnished a home.
I have furnished a bunch of homes.,"No, you've married a bunch of women, who furnished a bunch of homes."
You want to eat off something? Fine. Move your piano in here and eat off that.,You're afraid.
"Of a dining table? You know, they don't actually come to life when you put a knob off your bedpost on them.","You are what you sit in. Your friends, your job, your furnishings it all defines you."
You don't really beliEve that. You just don't want to do the shopping.,"Buy some furniture, or admit that you're empty inside."
"That means she only had one or two drinks, tops.",And there's no sign of trauma.
How'd you know?,"Because if there was, Cuddy wouldn't have needed me to take the case."
How do you know Cuddy!?,"Foreman's the only one with the balls to take a case without checking with me, and he's still working on breakfast."
"Cuddy has a soft spot for smart girls, and they don't start drinking until second semester, senior year.","So either you think that smart women look out for each other, which means you're an idiot, or you think Cuddy's not smart, which means..."
Then how did you,Picture fell out of the file. She looks smart. Where's Taub?
You don't already know?,"Yeah, he's at home in a fight with his wife. I'm just curious what he wanted me to know."
Two drinks is hardly a binge.,reading the file Certainly not if you're an Aussie.
We'll get a C-13-pyruvate MRI to check for cardiac lactic-acid lEvels.,Someone call Taub. Tell him to cut the ball and chain on his own time.
It could be fastidious enteric bacteria.,"You think she's been eating your wife's cooking? Hey, I'm on your side, Man."
I am not fighting with my wife. I had a flat tire. It's in my trunk. You can go look at it if you want.,Don't need to. Face tells me you're bluffing. Taub looks at him questioningly Not yours Chase's.
"If that valve is about to dehisce, echo could trigger a heart attack.",So come up with a better idea or have a crash cart ready.
The dissection means we were wrong about alcohol causing a hypertensive crisis.,And by we you mean you.
Yeah. You were the one who didn't have any better ideas.,It's not my fault. I was busy trying to Judge Taub.
Unless it was inside her.,Meaning?
Could be some kind of neuropathy. Syphilitic lightning pains?,It's not syphilis. VDRL and enzyme immunoassays were negative.
What about a blood clot?,While she's on anticoagulants from the aortic surgery?
While she's on anticoagulants from the aortic surgery? Interstitial nephritis?,Wouldn't cause the edema or dissection.
But cancer could.,Would you care to be a little more specific?
We could do a full-body scan.,We hate full-body scans.
And by we you mean you. We also hate when a Patient dies before we figure out what's wrong with them.,Do the scan.
coming into the room What do you think?,I think you work quickly.
"Piece of cake, you give them money, they give you furniture. Not bad, huh?",Nope. It's not bad at all.
texting to Rachel Whatcha doing?,"If there was any sign of inflammation of the aorta, that would make sense."
House! It's not funny. I got enough pRoblems already.,Trust me. This is gonna help.
An aneurysm explains the hallucinations. And it's the one thing we haven't excluded from the differential.,to Taub Your texting does not prove you're faithful. It just proves you know she thinks you're unfaithful. Can't force trust. turning back to the case What did she hallucinate?
The content of the hallucination isn't relevant.,Not usually.
Not usually. Not Ever.,"We know nothing, brain knows all."
"Sure. That's the same as the brain shouting, you have pancreatic cancer.",Her subconscious is trying to tell her something. We need to eavesdrop.
"She was screaming she was being sucked into a black hole, so, we should look for a tumor in her anus?",We need the whole story. The cognitive pattern recognition program might tell us what's going on in her head.
"Or we could act on something based in science, not science fiction. Get an MRA with contrast to see if she has an aneurysm, unless you think Cuddy's gonna go for the mind reading.","Fine. Do the MRA. When it comes back negative, we can move on to the... crazy but possible ideas. the team leaves"
clearing his throat What did you do with the furniture?,I returned it.
You told me to buy it.,But you didn't buy it.
"So what? We had a table, chairs",But no clue what any of it meant.
Fine. I'll hire a decorator.,Perfect. Another Woman to tell you who you are.
I'll hire a male decorator.,Step inside one furniture store and find one thing you like.
"I like, not doing this.",One.
Inner-ictal E.E.G. showed no synchronous discharges.,And the MRA?
No aneurysms or arterial or venous malformations in the brain.,As predicted. What did we say we'd move on to?
"Temporoparietal junction was clean on MRI, MRA, and whole-body scan.","Which just leaves us with the question of, what happened during the out-of-body experience?"
"If I say her blood pressure shot up over 200 and she bit her tongue, would that be a satisfactory answer?",Sure. If you then went on to answer the following Did she float above her body? Did she see Jesus? Did she bathe in the Ganges?
"No, no, and no. Can we get back to the medical science?",No.
"Even if we can get the equipment, it takes hours for the initial mapping. If she has another seizure, she could stroke out.","Coincidentally, she could also have a stroke if we do nothing."
I'm not telling a mother who's scared out of her mind that our best shot is a magic trick.,"It's not magical. It's experimental. Just like washing your hands after pooping once was. And technically, it's not our best shot. I'm pretty sure it's our only shot."
"It's not magical. It's experimental. Just like washing your hands after pooping once was. And technically, it's not our best shot. I'm pretty sure it's our only shot.","Perfect. So, Foreman, go get her consent. The rest of you go down to the cog sci lab. Equipment should already be there."
"And I want to, but","Inspiration point doesn't open till after dark. Got a real cool magic show about to start. Also, I'm gonna need to check your spare."
"Well, it's taken us just over an hour to prove that she has a very boring subconscious.",Anyone Ever tell you you can be a real buzzkill?
looking at the monitor Stars? Maybe that's a stripe?,It's the sky. She's thinking about the moon and the stars and the sky.
"Or, star could be a white blood cell. Leukemia?",Who's that?
Her dad? He died when she was eight.,What did daddy die of?
looking up at House What do you think it means?,"She likes school, and she has daddy issues Neither of which helps us."
"Liver's responsible for proteins, immunological effects, production of red blood cells. Might be able to explain the lungs, the hallucinations.",still examining the model of the brain Not the aortic dissection.
"Kidneys are also failing. We add in polycystic disease, could explain the dissection.","So that's one imperfect theory, plus a rare complication of a second theory, which gives us a complete explanation. Don't polish the notion, Foreman."
What if it's obscuring a tumor? It's the only place we couldn't look inside.,Get a better look at her pineal gland with three tesla fast spin echo MRI. The team leaves to do the test
MRI rEvealed no remarkable features on her pineal gland. But there were slightly elevated lEvels of lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes.,Which we would expect to see if there was an allergic reaction happening.
Parasite? There's this Middle Eastern parasite,angry because they have reached a dead end How exactly do you want to be shot down?
"sighing again So, either we find the answer at autopsy or... What?",I got nothin'.
"I was gonna head out. If there's any change, I assume you'll page me?","Are you having an affair? Does it bother you that your wife doesn't have the guts to actually ask that question, and I do?"
"On both ends, yes.","Difference is, I'm not afraid of the answer. And I might beliEve you."
I'm not having an affair.,But you want to.
"No, I don't. I'm through living like that.","Why? What, you finally got to the point where half your age plus sEven just isn't young enough?"
"Talk to you later, House.",Or is it because you now really are old enough to be their He pauses as the answer suddenly comes to him The dad. Does he travel for work?
"What do you mean, does he? He died almost ten years ago.","Not hers, her boyfriend's. He's the one in her visions."
"Not hers, her boyfriend's. He's the one in her visions.",I'm your son's girlfriend's doctor.
I'm your son's girlfriend's doctor. Oh.,"It's a mouthful, but pRobably not as tricky as your title."
"Um, okay. Is Abby gonna be all right?",Do you travel a lot?
"Yeah, I have a food-import business. Why?",Where'd you go?
"All over France, Italy, the mediterranean. Why?",I think you exposed her to a parasite.
Oh. I thought the scans didn't show any.,Because she doesn't have any.
But you just said,It's cool.
"Well, that's fantastic.","You'd think so, wouldn't you? Only thing is, did you Ever have sex with your son's girlfriend?"
Where the hell do you get off asking,Shut up!
Dad? What's going on?,"walking around behind Artie so that he is now facing his son Gee, this is bad, because you now have to choose between her living and the truth becoming public."
rationalizing You'd broken up.,to Nick Your girlfriend is not allergic to your semen. She's allergic to the Egyptian parasite swimming around in your dad's semen.
I was drunk. We both...,"No need to explain. Technically, she was legal."
"Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait!","Hey... All things considered, it's actually great news."
So what do you think?,"You wussed out, and used a decorator."
Why can't that be me The wuss who loves decorators?,'cause it's not.
Okay. It's not. But don't return it. I can't keep doing this.,You have to. You can't keep letting other people define you.
You have to. You can't keep letting other people define you.,Not another elephant.
Not another elephant.,Decorator didn't pick this.
You're gonna have to buy your own cape.,"turning to look at Wilson I like what this says about you, Wilson."
"Oh, it's beautiful.",What'd you tell him?
That it doesn't mean she doesn't love him.,And he bought it?
seriously It's true.,Your wife say yes?
How did you know,"Monkey see, monkey do. At least he has the young and stupid excuse."
She said yes.,sincerely Good for you.
We cannot allow anyone to leave the hospital at this time. All personnel should remain in their staging areas unless otherwise instructed by security.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, gotta clear the"
I think I can live with that.,You're on two milligrams of morphine an hour.
The nurse said I might only have a day or two left.,She was being kind.
"You're Dr. House, aren't you?","Oh, God, don't tell me we used to date."
"The limp. Yeah, I read about you. I sent you a letter before they knew what was wrong. Tried to get you to take my case.","Yeah, well, you should have kept reading. Heart disease is kind of below my pay grade."
This doesn't bother you?,You talking with your mouth full? A little.
I meant the fact that you're standing here watParkng me die because of my my file bored you.,I take maybe 1 in 20 cases.

I was a classics professor at Princeton for 26 years. Mostly research.,"So your closest colleagues died 2,000 years ago. That must be it. Not that you have no friends because, say, you're a miserable bastard."
What do you care?,The next few hours are gonna be grim.
"Oh, is that a favor to me or to you?",Win-win.
"laughs shortly No, thanks.",Are you trying to guilt me for not taking your case?
You think a classicist doesn't beliEve in fate?,"You think Odysseus would lie whimpering like a loser in a hospital bed? getting up and approaParkng Nash Come on, take my offer. Take the drug holiday. Numb yourself out."

For the whole month?,The pain's migrated. I think the arterial wall is damaged.
"What, you don't know?",I haven't had an arteriogram yet.
"And you don't want the test. In case the arterial wall is fine. Which would mean that the pain is coming from something else. slight, smug smile What's her name?",Interesting... That you jump from physical pain to long-lost love. You're projecting. So what's her name?
What time is it?,What does it matter to you?
"reads the cover of a file he's holding Dr. Taub, comma, Christopher Michael.",So this is what it comes down to in the final hours.
It's my daughter.,So why isn't she here?
"I left my family... when Gracie was six. I was sort of forced out, actually, after I'd had an affair with a student.",For sex or love?
"Neither. I'd only married Gracie's mother because of the baby. But I didn't think I could handle commitment, and, like any decent academic, I proved myself right.",And what time it is matters because?
"She's a dance teacher in Atlanta. She gets home from work at 900, and I just wanted to speak to her one more time. That's my story. What's yours?",Same thing. Pretty much.
I'm gonna be dead in a few hours. Your secrets couldn't be safer. Unless you're keeping them from yourself.,I like being alone.
We nEver really did have a proper good-bye.,It's 900.
I guess she's running late.,You don't seem that surprised. Nash looks away from him. That's what you expected to get. You waited until you knew she'd be out.
"Her aunt said that she starts work late. Every now and then, I just call to hear her voice on the maParkne. I was nEver there when she needed me, so... What right do I have to need her now?",None.

"A full set of armor would protect against visible trauma, but not transmitted concussive force. Could be a subdural hematoma.",You're forgetting to demonize.
"An evil, satanic subdural hematoma.",No. Two demon eyes. Hemorrhaging in the sclerae.
Could be an allergic reaction to something from the Renaissance Fair.,"Which is why we need to check out Middle-earth. Foreman, take Frodo and break bread with the Hobbits."
standing I still think a hematoma is more likely.,to Taub That's why you and Chase are gonna get an MRI.
But you just,"I said Frodo, not Gollum."
I don't Even know who Frodo is.,"Who's the Parkck, and why are you hiding her?"
You were home last night?,"putting down the sword and closing the door And this morning. I bumped into your babe, naked."
I told you to stay out of my bathroom.,I was in the kitchen.
She was naked in the kitchen?,I was naked.
Why the hell were you naked in the kitchen?,"Uh, it's not important right now. What is, is why you didn't want me to meet her in the first place. Is she married?"
Is she married? No.,A Patient?

"Listen, I know that, in your own demented way, you think you're looking out for me. But I have this.","By this, you mean a sinking feeling in the pit of the stomach."
I can wait. For what?,"To tell you, I told you so."
That's not exactly sanitary.,Fun stuff nEver is.
A lumbar puncture could confirm.,"Except it's not food poisoning. If it was, the E.R. would look like Camelot right now."
I think they call that breakfast in Australia.,"No one else was sick, because they weren't allergic like he was."
"No one else was sick, because they weren't allergic like he was. To what?",That's what I sent you to Middle-earth to find out. House tosses the cow eye to Foreman Run scratch tests for the samples you brought back.
"That's gonna take time, and he's getting worse.",testily So treat him with epinephrine too.
"It's definitely not an allergy, or the epi would have helped him, not made him worse.",sitting on the nurse's station counter and rubbing his leg Unless he's allergic and allergic to the cure. Sodium bisulfite the preservative that keeps epi peppy can cause tachycardia.

"I'm sure you'll be fine. pointing to Taub and Chase You two get a sample to the lab to confirm, to Thirteen you get the Knight into isolation and on I.V. antibiotics. to Foreman You... stay away from me. He leaves quickly",Need to talk.
"About the MRSA? I know, we're","sitting in a chair in front of the desk MRSA, shmrsa. Something important."
"Something you think is more important than the potentially lethal bacteria spreading like wildfire through my hospital? Well, that narrows it down to something personal and stupid.",Wilson.
Theory confirmed. He is dating his first wife. I know.,I don't beliEve it.
That he didn't ask your permission first?,"No, that he's actually capable of keeping a secret from me."
"Well, you'd be surprised how Many things Wilson doesn't tell you.",chuckling and leaning forward in the chair Would I? Like like how you slept with your father's best friend or...
I'm gonna kill him.,You need to break them up.
You need to break them up. Forget it.,So you'd rather sit back and watch while the evil blonde gorges on Wilson's tender flesh and then tosses out his bones like she did the last time?
"Yes, I do.","Well, then do something."
You know what happens when you interfere in other people's relationships?,"Of course. I do it all the time. Hmm, I see your point."
I took on three guys in college once.,coming into the lab Hope they bought you dinner first.
It's not MRSA.,"I know, it's poison Ivy."
"A sEvere reaction could cause the blisters and maybe irritate his eyes enough to cause the hemorrhaging, but the chest pain and seizures...",They have bonfires Every night.
"Okay, maybe it remotely fits, but I'd rather go with scientific evidence than with your gut.","How about this? Apparently, it's all over his sword."
He would have had symptoms way before the Renaissance Festival.,"Which is true of anything that would compromise his immune system, which means it has to be some other environmental toxin."
We already ruled out food poisoning. Both the butcher shop and the food stands at the fair were totally clean.,Then he ate the poison apple somewhere else. Or maybe you just missed it. Start treatment for triParknosis and confirm with a muscle biopsy. He leaves
Hey. I can't beliEve I'm about to say this. Sam!,Told you so.
"No, she didn't dump me. She wants to get to know you better.",Damn it. I nEver should have let her see me naked.
"It goes against all my instincts, but I said all right.",Why?
She thinks I was hiding her from you.,You were.
I don't want her to know.,So you're asking me to condone a relationship based on lies and mistrust.
So you're asking me to condone a relationship based on lies and mistrust. Yeah.,When and where?
"Tonight, Venezia, 800.",What am I gonna wear? All my cereal boxes are at the cleaners.
"House, listen. I know you're worried about me, and I also know that that kind of unselfishness doesn't come naturally to you. But I don't want your help. I don't need your help. Just come to dinner and be your usual selfish self.",How could I say no? He smiles and heads for the exit

We have plans.,I bet your plans don't taste like this.
"stopping Sam from taking one Don't! House, whatEver it is that you're up to",I'm trying to be nice. What I did the other night was juvenile. I'm sorry.

"Well, I need to go to the bathroom.","I think you're old enough, now. But if you would like me to come along with you..."
"Come on, James. Enough, already.","Yeah, James, I cook in peace."
Okay. I'll be right back.,"You're a cold-hearted bitch, who ripped his heart out."
And all this?,Phase two of getting to know my enemy.
"You're wrong about me. But I'm glad now I don't have to pretend to like you, except for when James is standing next to me.","Same here. Only difference is, I'll outlast you."
"Same here. Only difference is, I'll outlast you.",End scene.
"coming back into the room Well, it's too late for the movie. Wanna see what's on tv?",Absolutely.
We had to shock it back into rhythm twice during the night.,There's only one thing left to do.
We're wasting our time.,"Actually, I've already gotten good value."
"I told you, there's nothing here that could have caused any of his symptoms.","No, you told me that you couldn't find anything here that could be causing the symptoms."
"And now we're gonna find something new because we're in costume? We looked Everywhere, tested Everything. Just because Wilson's acting stupid doesn't mean we are.",Do you think he's making a mistake?
"Of course. But he'll figure it out, sooner or later. Hopefully, after a few weeks of great sex. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.",Wilson's not like us. He cares too much about people and their feelings.
Thanks for the compliment.,"The code that our Knight claims to live by, all that crap about honor and Parkvalry. Wilson's naturally like that, which is why he's"

That's hemlock? You sure?,Did you sell it to anyone?
It was just one branch.,You sold it to Sir William?
No. To the King.,He looks at Thirteen It's the only part of the environment you didn't check. The people living in it.
What's going on? Why can't we see William?,Because you poisoned him. Your royal anus. He holds up the hemlock With this.
He holds up the hemlock With this. Wild carrots?,Hemlock. I need to know how much you used and how you prepared it.
"He's still alive. You want to avoid a murder charge, start talking fast.",The apothecary's willing to testify that you're the only one he gave it to.

"Sure. House looks back at Lucas Oh, him? Yeah, I was just leaving.",Careful. I have a sword.
"pushing the sword toward the floor I don't agree with what you said. But I understand why you said it. We were married young, we both made mistakes, and yes, I did make most of them. But that was almost a decade ago.","I'm sorry, is that the statutory period for soul sucking?"
"I'm not asking you to like me, House. To be honest, I think you're an ass. But we do have one thing in common. We care about James.",So prove it. And dump him... again.
"You're pretty much insufferable all the time, aren't you?","Sorry, go on. And, yes."

He gives Wilson a look. What?,Nothing.
"Clearly, SOMETHING. We can hear the capitals.",Nope.
"House, on a list of your attributes, there's nothing that Even rhymes with coy.","Okay, I may have seen something in the fridge."
It's not a big deal.,"You hate that she did that, but you didn't say anything. Wilson laughs"
You're trying to get us to fight.,"No, I'm trying to help. If you got an issue, let her know."
I should have known that you weren't done sabotaging this.,Fine.
Animals also eat their young and kill their rivals. That make it weird that most of us don't?,Says the guy whose opposable thumbs have been all over how Many women who aren't his wife?
Our Patient's unhappy because she's suffering from an intestinal blockage.,Boring. Then we have to find a reason to rule it out.
Herpes might not register if she was exposed in the last six weeks.,But it would show up on a barium enema. He drops the file on the table and grabs his cane
Wait. You're gonna do it?,Barium coats the inner lining of your colon. Lets us get a good look at it on the X-ray.
"I'm on painkillers. I'd rather this not be what you think of Every time you look at my butt. She takes his hand, he smiles, they kiss, he goes. House shakes the enema bag like maracas, Julia smiles lightly.","Okay, roll onto your side. It's fill 'er up time. So is Evelyn his new squeeze?"
She's our daughter.,Must be interesting growing up in a production of Oh! Calcutta!
She's six. She knows as much about our sex life as any other kid her age.,You can explain that she's the reason the two of you stayed married.
"You've been in the room five minutes. You got us all figured out. Of course, you left out the part where we love each other and we want to grow old together.",But you just don't want to be young together.
But you just don't want to be young together.,Tank's full. I'll page the radiology elves.
"It stopped hurting during the X-ray, which means it was just an intestinal blockage that passed. We should discharge her.",Absolutely.
We'll be here all night.,"No, Taub will be here all night. Talk to the unicorn and then tell me you don't beliEve. He puts his glasses on and grabs something to read."
Guy's got a license to drill. Why would he lie about not using it?,That's not the lie.
"No, no, no. He's not being cynical. He's assuming the husband is doing something to Even the score, which means he thinks there is a score, which means, cheating swans aside, House beliEves in monogAmy. He's being roMantic. During this part, House quits the sad look for a warning one, then gestures his hands to Thirteen tone, like it's music.",What I beliEve is that men are genetically engineered to be jealous.
She's been with two people other than Tom in the last six months. Neither of them have been outside the tri-state area.,So we're back to the husband.
You just said you beliEved,He's doing something behind her back. What better cover than a business trip to Nebraska? Like that's really a place.
"So paralysis, arrhythmia, and intermittent abdominal pain.","And he nicked himself shaving. Sorry. That was Taub. But it was easier to solve. Means he used the crappy razor in his locker, which means he slept here."
Thanks to you. I brought up open marriage with Rachel. It was a disaster.,"On the medical front, we've knocked out sex and foreign travel. Could be an electrolyte imbalance."
You pushed me into this.,"Figured it would either blow up your marriage or make it more honest. Either way, you win."
"Increased libido can be a symptom of adrenocortical carcinoma, which also explains her other symptoms.",Just because Everybody in this room wishes that all women were horny all the time doesn't make it so. Chase looks amused. Get an MRI of her adrenal glands.
"If he has a secret, I highly doubt it's more relevant than the clot.","Clotting disorder would explain Everything. We hear the office door opening. Question is, which one?"
Do you read any of your departmental memos?,"Only the ones labeled, n-s-f-w."
"Only the ones labeled, n-s-f-w.","Sorry, that's n-n-s-f-w."
"Sorry, that's n-n-s-f-w.","Oh, I'm long past the number of procedures that'll bankrupt them."
"We'll just give you a few minutes to She pinches House's arm and start to go. He turns, but doesn't move.","By we, she means she. Thirteen sighs and stays."
It's not medically relevant. You're not gonna care.,Wilson's been teaParkng me how to care. Try me.
He builds wind turbines and leases them out to local power companies.,"You're right. I don't care. Heavy rubber band shaking. Clotting disorder DIC. Factor five leiden, antiphospholipid syndrome."
"Congratulations, House. Sam ended it.",Go test our Patient's blood!
But it can wait five minutes.,! for Everything we discussed. Thirteen leaves. House turns to Wilson. I'm sorry.
"Or you could have stayed out of it. I could have kept my mouth shut, been annoyed sometimes, but I'd be happy, because I'd still be with her. House listens, still playing with his red rubber band. Now all I have is cold milk. He starts to leave.","As long as you're free, you want to grab some dinner? Wilson looks like he wants to strangle House, but leaves anyway."
All our tests came back negative. It's not a clotting disorder.,Which means we need to come up with a better idea.
"Which means we need to come up with a better idea. So what causes pRoblems in the stomach, heart, nerves? Taub is waving pages of the file, looking somewhat smug. House stops, takes a deep breath, gets his trademark epiphany look.","Oh, my God."
No sign of sParkstocytes or hemolysis. So you're actually going to sleep with another Woman then go home to your wife?,Thank God someone's keeping us focused on what's really important. He sits next to Taub and watches him closely.
Taub was gonna do all of that anyway. Pulmonary arterial hypertension.,Imaging showed normal diameter in her pulmonary artery. Here's a thought They all pay attention. Taub's wife is now totally on the market. Mind hitting me with her digits?
Get the portable ultrasound in here. We need to get a look at her belly.,"Pain, pain went away, came back another day. Question is, what brought it back?"
Patient. Abdominal pain.,"Yeah, he's right. Let's get this wrapped up before 6. Taub turns back into a faithful pumpkin at midnight."
"My point was that arousal is a function of the parasympathetic nervous system. If that's where the pRoblem is, the pain could be triggered by crying, which seems","PNS also controls digestion, which she's been doing without screaming her head off since she's been here."
"When this happens in adults, it's usually a sign of abdominal cancer. We'll fix the overlap, and then search your intestine for tumors.",Foam?
I have a bad feeling about this.,"Nothing. That's the beauty. I genuinely tried to help Wilson. I told him to stand up for himself, which you know is legitimate advice. And his relationship blew up."
So you're paying it forward?,"If this should somehow lead to Lucas dying or oral sex, so be it. Cuddy looks somewhat entertained."
Or her declining kidney function. We ran panels during surgery.,"Actually, IBD does make sense, 'cause it could trigger ankylosing spondylitis, which would explain the heart and the kidneys."
"We've gone from too few ideas to too Many, and our Patient's running out of time.",Why the lack of afterglow? Physio girl not as freaky as you'd hoped?
"I can't hurt Rachel like that. Sickle cell anemia would have shown on blood tests. No flattened intestinal villi rules out celiac. They all stare at him. He stops. Seriously? Our Patient's dying, and we can't move past my sex life?","Seriously, you'd think it'd kill her if we spend 15 seconds mocking you?"
And it can't be Henoch-Schonlein purpura. He crosses it off. No inciting respiratory infection and no rash.,I don't care what it's not. I want to know what it could be.
Sarcoidosis makes sense too.,Good. Treat for those three.
O for three. Her kidney function is still declining. We're gonna need to start dialysis.,"Glad the husband's back. After missing so Many little deaths, he should be here for the big one. Top six, anyone?"
"Top six, anyone? Polyarteritis nodosa?","We'd have seen some improvement on prednisone. Looking at flowers in the room. Guy's wife's dying, and he stops to buy flowers."
They're from his garden. Mercury poisoning fits.,Those are lilacs.
We also ruled it out because there's no rash.,Maybe we just didn't see it.
Maybe we just didn't see it.,Have you been stung by a bee recently?
What's going on? I don't.,Not that you know of.
"Aah. When she opens her mouth, we all see a purpuric rash on the roof of her mouth. House looks disappointed.",I was kinda hoping for kinky.
I'm gonna be okay. I love you. They hold hands. The team leaves the room.,"That is adorable. Other than you still wanting to have sex with other dudes, and him bankrupting your family, I think you kids are pretty much home free."
And! He puts down some more cards. House enters the room and looks at them.,You two made up?
You two made up?,You can thank me later.
"from another room Esteban, start getting ready.",I met the neighbors.
talking on the phone I don't need a temporary. I need a perManent. Yesterday. Please do.,Good morning.
"Hardly. One of my P.A.s quit an hour ago, and I have to reshuffle next month's schedule.",checking his own message slips That's nothing. I woke up in the wrong bed this morning.
Any bed you're in is the wrong one.,looking at Jeffrey over the top of his sunglasses That's not what your mama said. snapping his fingers in the air Oh! Snap.
I'll be going now. He closes a file and leaves To HuMan Resources.,"He started it. It was the neighbor's kid's bed. Luckily, Esteban still likes sleeping with mommy."
How drunk were you?,About yea drunk.
"Are you okay? You shouldn't be drinking at all, much less",You sound just like Esteban's mom.
I need you in the clinic.,"Sorry, I'm busy."
"Sorry, I'm busy.","to Chase Tell me you have a case. You know, Even if you don't."
I have a case.,Sounds interesting. I'll take it. They walk away from Cuddy I owe you one. Now tell me you don't have a case.
I really do have a case.,We're Even.
I really do have a case. We're Even.,You guys know how to Honeymoon. He tosses his cane and then his backpack to Chase
He can't speak.,Aphasia is Greek for loss of voice.

"We ruled out all the common causes of fainting Low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, dehydration.",Don't say ah.
Do you know what it is?,tossing the tongue depressor in the trash Roll on your side and lift up your gown.
tossing the tongue depressor in the trash Roll on your side and lift up your gown.,There's one thing they didn't test for.
A test for what?,Faking.
Faking. Ow!,Test was positive.
rolling back over I I can I can talk. I I wasn't faking. My voice just came back right now.,"Hey, I'm not the one you have to convince."
I know he wasn't faking.,"Well, if she's buying that, she might just be a keeper."
What about the syncope?,"Well, the House pretends to faint and collapses onto Ted's bed"
"Well, the House pretends to faint and collapses onto Ted's bed",Is she buying this too?
Why would he fake anything?,"getting up off the bed Kryo podia. It's Greek for duh. taking his cane and backpack from Chase Still, you get to keep the engagement ring."
I don't think he was faking.,That's because you're more gullible than I am.
The same way a guy doesn't give up a lucrative medical practice to come work for you?,That's exactly why you dabble. You're compensating for your professional conquests with sexual ones.
"I'm not that predictable. For example, you're pRobably not expecting me to ask you out for dinner tonight.","No, thanks."
You won't Even consider it?,"I did, just very quickly."
"The truth is, since I called this thing off, my wife has been very grateful and I could do with a down night. If I go out with the boss, nobody can blame me.",Okay. If you bring your wife.
No. That's the point. I need a little,You're lying.
I'm not lying.,Then I'm not going.
"Ted, what's wrong? Are you what's wrong? Oh, my God. Can somebody help us? Ted collapses to his knees and a nurse runs toward them Please! Please hurry. Just breathe. Oh, my God.","There's gotta be a better way to call off a wedding. A Tweet, for example."
There's at least 200 ccs of fluid in there.,"turning around to look at the team Okay, let's say all his symptoms are real. Explain how one of them suddenly went away without using the words virgin or Mary."
ER ruled out infection. Eosinophil count ruled out parasites.,A medication he's not telling us about.
"You really don't trust this guy, do you?","I don't Even trust the ER. Let's rule out infections ourselves. Tap his lungs, send cultures, run cytology for cancer, and check his blood pressure."
"Tap his lungs, send cultures, run cytology for cancer, and check his blood pressure. We already","This time, talk about nuptials while you do it. Check his home for Everything else."
He just moved in with his fiancee three months ago. Toxic exposure could take longer than that to Manifest.,to Foreman You check his love nest. to Taub and Thirteen You two check his swinging bachelor pad.
That somebody else now lives in?,I assume so.
I'm not gay.,"Really? 'Cause it would certainly explain the cold feet. Oh, and the boyfriend."
After three years?,"Well, it's possible. It doesn't mean you're gay just 'cause the guy you're sleeping with is."
Lung tap turned up mononucleosis. ER doesn't routinely test for it. It explains the PE and can be virtually asymptomatic.,"So we got to wondering, how does a 27-year-old get mono? You're a little old for the kissing disease, unless your immune system is compromised."

ECT doesn't cause neural damage.,Unless it was done at Dr. Liberace's he-Man quackery camp. Run an EEG. See if they straightened him or just scrambled him.
"sitting down across from House Sorry. I completely forgot. My wife just started a ceramics class Tuesdays at 800. It's a half-hour drive from here. She won't be back till 1030. He looks up at House, who doesn't beliEve him She's taking it with her girlfriend Marly. She hopes to make a tea service. You want to call her?",No need. I already texted her. And here she is now.
No need. I already texted her. And here she is now.,leaning in close I think you're still seeing the physio.

So what caused the arrest?,"Four ways to stop a heart. He walks toward Taub Electrical pRoblems, restricted blood flow, blood where it shouldn't be, shocks, blocks, or bleeds."
I think that's three things.,"looking at Taub And cheating. he guffaws Oh, no. Sorry. That's how you break a heart."
to House I found a ceramics class in Trenton on Friday nights that was full so my wife couldn't join me. turning to address the team EP study ruled out shocks.,"Now you just have to find some pottery by Taub. The lamer it looks, the better."
So we'll do an angio to see if it's blocks or bleeds.,You should be a doctor.
I'm gonna check out this new lesbian bar tonight.,Your life is awesome.
hanging up the phone I was telling a 33-year-old Woman that she has breast cancer.,"No, you weren't."
How do you know?,"Because if you were, you'd need to see the pain in her eyes so she could see the concern in yours."
I'm doing it to help you.,By setting me up with a hottie that I can't sleep with? And Thirteen?
I've been spending more time with Sam. I know it's been hard on you. I figured if you had some company,I don't need your help.
Then consider it helping our neighbor's four-year-old.,I gave him a dollar. How much did you have to pay?
"Nothing. I just told them you might be feeling down and it was in their self-interest to keep you company. House doesn't beliEve him 100 bucks, Foreman held out for 2.

So do I. Should I call or raise with a double gutshot draw?,No. What about infection?

Remind me why that has anything to do with you.,A distracted person makes a distracted professional.
And destroying my marriage will help me focus.,PRobably.

nodding What about her? The Bartender?,She's the only one who's not here for fun.
"Trust me, she's not straight.","If your gaydar is so great, how come you didn't know about the Patient till you met his boyfriend?"
The guy walked in with his bride. It took me a while to rotate my dish. It's unbelievable what he's doing to her.,You don't think he loves her?
"He may love her, but he needs to have sex with other men.","Taub loves his wife, but he needs to have sex with other women."

"It's not P.O.T.S., we're back to square one.","into the phone Not quite. You did a spinal tap, but the headaches got worse."
We're maxing him out on morphine.,He sprung a leak. He's losing CSF from the tap site.
We made his headaches worse?,"Just you, actually."
That still wouldn't explain why he got the headaches in the first place.,"The low pressure in his brain caused the P.O.T.S., not the other way around. Patch the leak and top him up with artificial CSF. He closes his phone"

finishing Taub's sentence was normal.,How are the headaches?
How are the headaches? Terrible.,Give me your head.
What the hell?,I know. It's the first time you've heard that sentence with a possessive pronoun.
"Oh, wow, that that's better. Okay, enough.",How cool is that?
Its orthostatic effect was mimicking P.O.T.S.,"It also does an uncanny Christopher Walken. Unfortunately, if you treat it like P.O.T.S., it gets worse. So, as far as that goes, oops."

"Based on the fact that you were late, and you didn't notice the pictures in the outer office.",Those aren't symptoms.
"They are to me. And here's another one. You took the case. Hmm? No negotiating, no bargaining. No clinic hours changed hands. Were you looking for something to distract you from the fact that your best friend just threw you out?",Case was interesting.
It's not organic. It's not mysterious. Most likely some psychologically traumatic Event occurred that made the Patient's brain choose to forget Everything.,slight smile Or not.
slight smile Or not.,Here. Loss of differentiation between gray and white matter. He points to an area on the scan.
standing next to House Do I need to know this?,"Fine. I'll give you the Cliff Notes version. Chase MS, Taub physical trauma. I can tell you why we ruled them out."
Good luck with that.,Her heart rate monitor has a serial number.
Did he really say that?,Subtextually.

"So Wilson threw you out, and you threw Alvie out just, uh, another week?","Unlike me, Alvie didn't leave."
So I brought him with me to protect the apartment. Why?,To protect the apartment. Whoa. Deja vu.
"Tossing him out or, uh, sending him to the movies or, uh, locking him in the bathroom would also minimize Alvie's destructive force. But you chose his company deliberately. Why?","Obviously because he's a Wilson substitute. You can barely tell the difference between them, especially when Wilson raps about the hood."
"I'm not suggesting Alvie's a substitute, but he would make a great distraction.",From what?
Maybe the heart rate monitor was a gift. That's why no one recognized her.,"Shut up, Alvie. Anything familiar! Church, grocery store?"
"It's okay, Ms. X. Maybe she's nEver been to this town before, bought the heart rate monitor on the store's website.","You know that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, right? Instead of working the case, why don't you contemplate the inanity of an American with American immigration issues?"
I had a birth certifiCate. I lost it.,So get a new one.
"I tried that, House. But the town hall had burned down when I was a kid, destroyed the records.",There's only one copy?
They tried to make me fill out a whole bunch of forms before they'd give it to me. I decided it would be quicker and easier to do it myself.,How'd that go?
What if nothing Ever looks familiar?,"Then someone will show up a spouse, a friend to tell you who you really are and what you should be feeling. They always do."
I don't know who that is! But I miss him.,What did they say at the hearing?
I didn't go. I lied once.,"Your mother is Puerto Rican, therefore, you are Puerto Rican. All you got to do is prove your mom's your mom, find some documentation"
"People like that don't listen to people like me. Doughnuts! distracted and very excited Hey, House, let's get doughnuts!","Alvie, the hearing"
"Everyone loves doughnuts glazed, crullers, elephant ears, Even doughnut holes. Much better than the sporting goods store. I bet Mrs. X went there all the time.",We're not here voice over And then I realized! to Alvie You make a good point.
"Dozen glazed, dozen jelly-filled? She points to Ms. X You want the usual, right?","Your old friend, the fried carbohydrate. to the cashier She needed the calorically dense food to support the running habit. Do you know her name?"
Sandy! Or Shelley. I don't know. The guy she's with called her that once. I just work here.,Do you know where they live?
"The police said it was too soon to do anything, so I started calling hospitals on my own. Princeton Plainsboro wasn't Even on my list. You really think something around here could have made her sick?","Here, work, anywhere she could have been exposed. Why wasn't Princeton Plainsboro on your list?"
That doesn't sound like me.,Do you have any idea what would sound like you?
voice over So what were you thinking during all this?,voice over That it was a strange position to be in.
back in the office What about you?,What about me how?
"Well, there was a sort of, um, artificial intimacy between you? She had been dependent on you. Uh, did you find that attractive on some lEvel? Disturbing?",Those are my two choices? None of the above. She was just a Patient. She was interesting.
"You know, she just won a settlement for some families whose housing dEvelopment was built on an old methane field.",Toxic exposure to methane could explain this.
"All right, it's nothing personal. Bet she didn't think you were her type back when you first met either.","We'll take her back to the hospital, test her blood and urine and start treatment."
Oh! I'm all right.,What happened?
Her pants are wet.,Urinary incontinence. He checks Sidney's eyes. She's having complex partial seizures. This isn't methane. And you can leave the bucket. We need to get her to
voice over Seizures? back in the office This is the second diagnosis you've come up with that has a personal resonance for you.,I'm choosing my diagnoses based on personal issues? You think she fell down the stairs and peed her pants 'cause Wilson dumped her too?
"You're choosing to tell me about this case, so let's look at it. First you were fixated on a harmful toxin from her past, possibly because you're worried about a harmful toxin from your own past.",Chase had the toxin idea. Maybe he's obsessed with my past.
Andand now you're talking about a seizure disorder?,Which is also not a toxin.
But which is most likely caused by an old injury to the brain. Whwhy do you see your past as such a threat?,"Not only am I unthreatened by it, I was trying to get it back."
"Not only am I unthreatened by it, I was trying to get it back.",There's a ding mark.
It's a piece of junk. It was dinged when it came in.,"Sure, thethe cup marks and the scuffs and the paint and those three Parkps. This fourth one's new."

How much for the pile? $500.,stunned You said it was junk.
Why is it so important that you get your stuff back?,Unlike the rest of huManity! Who's okay when their belongings are taken. Everyone wants their stuff. That's why it's their stuff.
Everyone doesn't pay five times what it's worth.,I like my stuff. I hate it when Wilson moves it
I hate it when Wilson moves it Oh!,This is not about Wilson!
I wasn't gonna say anything.,"31, 31! Hike!"
Hike! First down!,"One more, you get a touchdown."
"One more, you get a touchdown. Whoo!",Hike!
"Huh! House, holding the ball, goes to open the door. House, you can't run for the touchdown.",And! hike!
"voice over Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Alvie freezes in midair, having just caught the ball. Cut to Nolan's office. You seriously thought you were gonna tell me that Wilson showed up but not tell me what he said?",Because I thought you were a smart guy who didn't need the obvious spelled out to him.
"House, House, stop! Stop, stop, stop.",You okay?
Yeah. It was my mother's. She died when I was four. It's all I have left.,"That's very sad, Alvie. Listen, I set up an immigration hearing."
"Um, interesting. You present yourself as, uh, not giving a damn about other people's emotions, but your actions indiCate otherwise. You dismiss Alvie's story about his mother, but you cared enough to schedule a hearing.",I cared for eight seconds. Then I got distracted.
I cared for eight seconds. Then I got distracted.,Yeah.
voice over We've kept the Patient up for 12 hours now. No hint of seizure-like activity. We should shut this down.,"Try a stRobe light, add more stress."
"puts the phone back to his ear Apparently, without her memory, the Patient's personality has returned to what you might call its natural state.",Seems she had a wake-up call while she was at college.
The thing that caused the change is gone! So the change itself is gone.,Yeah. I knew the psychological aspects of this case would interest you. Bet you got a theory already. What is it?
It's not relevant.,deliberately What is it?
Why do you care about my theory?,"I think he just! bores her. She's at an earlier stage of dEvelopment. She's looking at her grown-up future, and it puts her to sleep."
"If he just bored her, she'd hide it to be polite. Their pRoblem is synchronicity. Just like you and me, House, they're not on the same page. He talks to her like someone he shares history with. But from her point of view, he's a stranger forcing intimacy on her. Of course she doesn't like him. He's not helping. He can feel he's losing his wife, and it makes him come on stronger.",He almost did lose his wife.
And the D.I. came from damage to the hypothalamus.,"pointing to the image on the monitor Hypothalamus here, hence the D.I."
"voice over. House turns toward the voice Okay, now you're just doing this to mess with me. cut to Nolan's office What possible relevance does this differential have to your pRoblems?",It ends with a diagnosis of spongiform encephalitis. I convinced the team to cut out part of this Woman's brain. That's not interesting to you?
No. He has his hand over his face and he sounds weary.,Not Even if it's the Amygdala? She'll lose all her long-term memory.
"Well, this is where you tell me that being cavalier with someone else's past has nothing to do with avoiding your own past. The case is irrelevant. You just found it, uh! interesting.",rubbing at his scalp with his fingertips as if he's washing his hair Aren't therapists supposed to be nurturing?
"Nowhere! is that in the Manual. Look, youyou've been in therapy for a year. You know when I ask you to talk about anything, I mean anything that affects you what upset you, what made you mad or reliEved or joyful. You want me to beliEve that this case means nothing? Then, um! why should I listen to it?",Are you charging me for this time?
not looking up Yes.,This is ridiculous.
What's that? On the back of your arm?,It's just a bruise. And I fell.
You remember falling?,No. I was drunk! Hence the balance issues. He reaches for his jacket.
"Well, it looks like you fell on the tip of someone's boot.",I said something that someone objected to.
"Well, if you don't remember, then how can you","It's usually the way it is when someone hits me. People who kick when you're down are jerks, but they're generally not irrational jerks."
"You got drunk enough to get into a bar fight and not remember, and you've been insisting that Everything's fine? Wwhywhy go out and get blind drunk? Were you looking for a fight?",I don't know.
closing the magazine What have you screwed up?,puzzled What?
"You say that when you've been hit in the past, it's because you provoked it with something that you said, which means you're well aware of the risks. So on some lEvel, you were in that bar looking for someone to hurt you. Logically, people punish themselves for something they did or something they didn't do. So what! did you screw up?","thinks, then shakes his head. speaks quietly I don't know. long pause Okay, there may be a pRoblem."
I told him your book was contaminated with Anthrax spores. Then I gave him $300. holds up a slip of paper The address of the buyer. pause Maybe I was hasty in asking you to move out. Why don't you stay with me and Sam for a little while? There's no need to hurry things.,What prompted this?
"Look, the whole idea was that after Mayfield, you wouldn't be on your own. I can touch base with you a lot more easily if you're staying with me than","grabbing the address God's sake, Wilson. You really span the chasm from wishy to washy. If you're gonna be an ass, be an ass. Stick with it."
"Why were you being so hard on the guy, when he was being conciliatory?",Come on. Cuddy played on his guilt. She put him up to this.
How do you know that? How do you know this wasn't entirely his own idea?,"Two reasons first, he wants to create the perfect environment to be with Sam."
Maybe it was Sam.,"voice over Yeah, that's a possibility."
"Okay, um! Not Sam. Uh, that still doesn't answer why Cuddy.","Because they've been talking about me. She called me to check on the Patient, which she nEver does without a reason. I asked why, and she said!"
"She's a barracuda attorney, House. These are the kind of Patients we like to keep happy.",Right now the Patient's lucky if she can spell jurisprudence.
"Yeah, but when she gets that memory back, which we are trying to make happen, she'll be able to spell lawsuit. I'm just touParkng base.",TouParkng base. Wilson used exactly the same phrase. Colluding about me is their favorite pastime.
Wait a minute. Taub's not here.,"Yeah, he is."
What's Taub doing in my imaginary version of a scene with Wilson and Cuddy?,"Your version needed to be ended, 'cause it's crap. It's all sweetness and light and! faith that I'm gonna choose the right path. Yeah, that sounds like Wilson."
I have as much evidence for mine as you do for yours. I know Wilson's your friend. So he could be wondering if he did right by you. And I know he wouldn't have asked you to move out in the first place unless he was convinced you could handle life on your own.,And I know that he and Cuddy have gone behind my back before to strategize about the House pRoblem.
So there's truth in both versions. But you choose to focus on the parts that make you uncomfortable. So! leans forward Why are you and Wilson! friends? Do you think this friendship is the best you can do?,Wilson is not a consolation prize.
"There! You're defending him. And a minute ago, he was skulking around in the background like some sort of Manipulative Iago.",glowering He's my friend.
So what do you value in him?,"thinks I can say whatEver I want to him, and he'll nEver leave."
"He's sort of leaving. At least, he won't be around as much! because he's putting Sam first.","For now. After the divorce, he'll pRobably ask me to move in again. I take the long view."
You say that to Wilson?,Are you kidding? That's the kind of remark that leads people to hit you.
"Uh, maybe you've been right from the beginning. Maybe this isn't about Wilson.",You say that now that I finally agree with you? Do you just argue the opposite of whatEver I say?
"I don't mean the Wilson thing doesn't, uh, bother you, uh, but it sounds like he's the closest you can come to a safe relationship. You'd have to do something major to screw it up. Um, whatwhat else have you been involved in this week? What would you want to punish yourself for?","thinking I told you, I don't know."
"Okay, um, let's approach it from a different angle. Have you gotten any other people angry at you over anything?","Well, yeah. That's why I called it an ordinary week."
Why wouldn't she? Of course she's willing to risk losing her memories perManently. She has no idea how important those memories are. Does she Even know what risk is? She's nEver lost anything.,"Without the surgery, she'll lose Everything. The prion infection will continue to advance and destroy her whole brain."
"Well, there has to be another way. Please. I'm speaking for my wife, the wife I lived with for four years who isn't here and can't defend herself. House turns and stares at a monitor. Dr. House, are you listening?","Well, you can stop arguing, 'cause it doesn't matter anymore. Look at the variability in the heart rate. The S.E. has spread into the brain stem."
No. We can't cut the brain stem.,This thing's moving too quickly.
That was pretty rough Do you always break the news to your Patients that way? Or were you short-handing it for me?,Husband was being an idiot.
"Well, he was asking for it. But, um, to punish him you have to punish the wife too. Whywhy did he make you so angry, Hmm? Because he didn't want to cooperate with you?",He'd rather risk his wife's life than their marriage. People's brains stop working when they think they're gonna lose someone they love.
Your leg hurt?,It's all right.
Okay. Anyone else you pissed off?,50 bucks for the book.
50 bucks for the book. Forget it.,You paid $25. That's 100% return.
"That's what I paid. But it's a rare surgical text, nearly 100 years old plates in mint condition. That book's worth sEveral thousand dollars.","$2,000. I'll write you a check."
"Yo, House, you want to stop by the library? 'Cause I got a book to return. Ta-ka-plow! He pulls the book from under his shirt. As House takes it, Alvie raps",Anyone see you?

voice over Not yet. Will she?,No way to know.

"following House down the hall That was your idea. And you asked me what I thought was going on between them. It's their relationship that's on your mind. That's why you've been thinking about this case relationships. Lost one with Wilson, gained one with Alvie.",Not exactly.
"Lost one with Wilson, gained one with Alvie. Not exactly.",Alvie?

I don't know. You're the one who set the theme something about relationships made you go out and provoke a fight. Wilson and Sam have a relationship. You're not thrilled about it.,"They're happy. Why should I screw that up? Everyone's happy. Everyone's moving in together Wilson and Sam, Cuddy and Lucas. Even Alvie's"
Cuddy and Lucas are moving in together? You didn't mention that.,They talked about moving in together before. It's not big news.

Much closer to getting out of here. Aah!,Come on. Pull her out.
Come on. Pull her out.,Come on!
Pull! Aahhh!,Hanna! Hanna! What the hell happened?
Lift this up.,"One, two, three"
"One, two, three",Kit. Gimme the kit.
Gimme the kit. All right.,"No breath sounds on the left side. Tension pneumothorax. Okay, Hanna."

You know who's Even luckier? You and just about Every other huMan being His cell phone rings who wasn't down there.,answering the phone What did the venogram say?
He didn't say his neck was sore.,That's 'cause Everything's sore. He just took a 15-story swan dive into concrete. Do an LP.
We also have to consider other infections.,So you're suggesting we do an LP.
I guess I am.,Genius.
Then we have to amputate.,No.
It's been four hours already. It used to be a long shot. Now it's...crazy.,Crush syndrome is basically a buildup of potassium. If we remove potassium
We're already treating with sodium bicarbonate.,But not with glucose and Insulin. We have glucose in the kit. There's gotta be a diabetic here somewhere.
You wanna dose the insulin here in a non-hospital setting? That is insane! It's not worth it.,still rubbing his leg Really?
"I know you're angry, but please don't put her life at risk just to get back at me.",Really? standing up and towering over her Wow. So this is all about you now.
You took her side against me right after you heard about my engagement.,Yeah. That must be it. It's not that you're a pathetic narcissist.
I don't love you. So just... accept it and move on with your life instead of making Everyone miserable.,That's great. A life lesson from a middle-age single mom who's dating a Man-Parkld.
Screw you. I'm sick of making excuses for you. I'm sick of other people having to tiptoe around you and make their own lives worse while they try to keep you from collapsing. I'm done. She walks away from him,calling after her Fantastic. Just stay away from my Patient.
seeing him Dr. House. Tell her.,"Hanna... We have to amputate your leg. Cuddy looks up at him, surprised"
No. You said... that there was time.,There was. And it's run out.
And it's run out. No.,You asked me how I'd hurt my leg.
shivering But you saved your leg.,I wish I hadn't.
I wish I hadn't.,"They cut out a chunk of muscle about the size of my fist, and they left me with this, mutilated, useless thing."
after a lengthy pause Okay.,"I got it. He picks up the amputation kit, taking responsibility for the amputation upon himself"
"I got it. He picks up the amputation kit, taking responsibility for the amputation upon himself",I can't put you out. It could depress your respiration too much. This should take away some of the pain. He pushes a drug into her IV
Will it be quick?,"I'll use a scalpel to slice through the skin, muscle, and fat."
How bad will it hurt?,Like nothing you've Ever felt before.
I love you.,into the phone What?
"He's fallen into a coma. LP was clean, but...",What are his vitals?
"Excuse me, Officer.","What do you mean, Officer? How long has there been a cop there?"
I don't know. Ten minutes. He was being questioned when he fell into the coma.,Was anything else making him nervous or worried before his other symptoms?
He was claustrophobic right before the bleed and before the fEver. We told him that he pRobably did fall asleep.,Was his BP spiking?
But that didn't cause his first symptom.,"Yeah, it did."
An arachnoid cyst on his lower spine. That's why we missed it. He's been sitting ten hours a day. Spiked his spinal fluid pressure.,Run a CT
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.,Breath sounds bilaterally.
What's happening. What's going on?,Her body won't get any oxygen unless we can bust the clot. This is a blood thinner.
Is she gonna be all right?,It's gonna make her bleed more. We'll take care of that next.
It's gonna make her bleed more. We'll take care of that next.,It's not busting the clot.
Maybe it's her heart. What?,It's not a clot. It's a fat embolism. From the amputation.
You can't blame yourself for her death. This wasn't your fault.,turning toward Foreman and shouting That's the point! I did Everything right. She died anyway. Why the hell do you think that would make me feel any better?
You shouldn't be alone right now. You're bleeding.,standing up and sounding menacing I'm gonna give you a task as an employee. Get out of my way.
Are you okay? Obviously not.,inhaling You going to leap across the room and grab them out of my hand?
No. It's your choice if you want to go back on drugs.,"Okay. Just so you know, I'm finding it hard to see the downside."
You need to re-bandage your shoulder.,Is that why you're here? Foreman sent you?
Foreman sent you? No.,You here to yell at me again?
You here to yell at me again? No.,"Well, I'm running out of ideas."
"Well, I'm running out of ideas. Lucas...","Oh, great. You're feeling uncomfortable again. PRobably means you just got back from some quickie wedding in Vegas or you're already pregnant."
I ended it.,shocked What?
"I'm stuck, House. sighing deeply I keep wanting to move forward. I keep wanting to move on, and I can't. I mean, my new House, with my new fianc, and all I can think about is you. exhaling I just need to know if you and I can work.",You think I can fix myself?
I don't know.,'Cause I'm the most screwed-up person in the world.
I know. I love you. pause I wish I didn't. But I can't help it.,How do I know I'm not hallucinating?
Did you take the Vicodin?,Nope.
smiling sweetly Then I think we're okay.,"also smiling sweetly, yes, sweetly Yeah."
"also smiling sweetly, yes, sweetly Yeah.",Damn it. I waited too long.
voice over It's your choice if you wanna go back on drugs.,You think I can fix myself?
softly Let me see. She peels the bandage off the wound on his neck. It's okay. He pulls his head away. She inhales sharply. It's gonna get infected.,"Hey, you're not gonna..."
It's okay. I love you.,So now what?
curling back onto her side Everything's good. We don't have to talk through it all.,"No, I meant it literally. Now what? We could make breakfast. We could go bowling. He lifts the sheet, checks and drops it back in place. We could stay here."
I have to go home and get dressed and go to work.,So that's it?
I'm hoping this is the beginning of it.,very quietly Yeah.
Hello? Dr. Cuddy?,"No, this is Dr. Cuddy's nanny. She's, uh, feeling a little under the weather now, so she won't be coming in today."
Oh. I hope she's all right. Would you mind asking her if,No. Can't do that. I'm afraid she's locked in the bathroom. Terrible bug going around. What's the pRoblem?
"Well, I'm sorry to disturb her, but it's Dr. Richardson. He must have the same stomach flu. He threw up in the O.R., and I'm not sure how she'd want me to",Hold on a second.
There's glass Everywhere. Couldn't you have just put the mirror down nice and gentle?,I was in a mood.
I'll be right back.,Don't get that.
It could be important.,This is important.
Okay. I'll go turn it off.,"Thank you. She leaves. When she comes back, she sits on the edge of the tub. Her hands are empty. You're distracted."
You're distracted. I'm not.,"Yeah, you are."
I'm sorry. The clinic is facing reduced funding from the state. Nurse Jeffrey is filing his 12th H.R. complaint. Richardson is threatening to quit because he's basically been a prisoner at the hospital for almost a week.,Richardson?
"The neurosurgeon. He's the only one I have right now, which means he has to stay on the premises at all times, or else the hospital technically isn't a lEvel one trauma center.",Which means?
"I'd have to shut down the E.R., transfer all of the Patients out of the ICU...","gets up Okay, stop. Turn around."
Turn around. Why?,Because you need to relax.
Where are we going?,I am going to make you a magical bath.
I must have solitude to focus my creative energies. Hello?,"Interesting factoid. Did you know that if we don't have a neurosurgeon on the premises, all the puppies in the world will choke to death on all the babies?"
Yeah. You got a note from Thirteen.,"So how come we don't have, like, five neurosurgeons?"
"Well, we had three, but Kapur retired, and then Nichols just took off for his daughter's wedding.","I've got good news. For the next 16 hours, you are the new neurosurgeon."
scoffing I'm not a neurosurgeon.,Which would matter if you actually had to do some neurosurgery.
"House, it's a hospital. The odds of having to do neurosurgery are higher than in most places.","If an EMT calls in with a brain or spinal trauma, just divert them to the nearest hospital."
"House, where the hell are you?",Great. Glad you're on it. hangs up and calls to Cuddy All systems go!
"Oh. Well, that makes it all right then.","So what, exactly, is this? It can still be open and casual and fun if you want."
Open? She looks up at him. You think I want to see other people?,"Well, last night was emotional for you."
Which I don't regret.,I'm not saying you do. I'm just saying it was an impulsive move.
Don't do this. Why do you have to analyze things to death? Why can't you just... let it be nice?,deep breath You're right. He squeezes his eyes shut. That was very anti-secret bath.
That was very anti-secret bath. House.,Yeah.
The secret bath is... burning my lady parts.,How do you think my whispers anus feels? Burning means it's working.
Can we get out now?,I was so waiting for you to say that.
I'm... not a neurosurgeon?,"And...voila! For the first course, I flaked some tender young ears of corn on the side of assorted exotic breakfast meats in a Parkli sauce reduction."
And the... second course?,"sitting A single grape. To cleanse the palate. Which is kind of a waste, 'cause there is no third course."
I'm glad we stayed in. This is actually... pretty good.,I can always tell when you lie. I mean always.
I slept with my freshMan roommate.,A lie.
A lie. A truth.,You have a tell.
What is it?,First admit that you were lying.
Fine. I was lying. My sexual history is boring and predictable. What is my tell?,"Are you kidding? If I tell you your tell, you'll get rid of it, then I won't be able to tell."
"Well, then you have to tell me something I don't already know about you.","Even though, technically, you didn't tell me something that I didn't already know about you."
Quit being so damn logical and just tell me.,"I used to have an intimate relationship with a photograph of you. Well, actually, a sock and a photograph."
"Well, actually, a sock and a photograph. I know.",I was lying.
The photo you took of me as Sleeping Beauty on Halloween. Why else would you take that picture?,"I have to pee. He gets up, holding his leg, and starts for the bathroom. Ha! You can't tell. 'Cause actually, I have to poo."
"I have to pee. He gets up, holding his leg, and starts for the bathroom. Ha! You can't tell. 'Cause actually, I have to poo.",whispers What?
Cuddy's assistant decided to use his own brain. Who put that idiot idea into his head?,Perhaps you could follow the same advice.
"He notified DPH that there's no neurosurgeon on the premises. Said he legally had to, which he legally had to.",Sounds like you got the situation under control.
"No. I don't. You know I don't. When DPH shows up, they're gonna shut down our E.R. This can't be fixed. It is what it is, House.",Great. I've got Every faith in your ability to solve the pRoblem.
Can I open them yet?,Just a second. A few heavy steps are heard. Okay. Hold out your hand.
Hold out your hand. Oh...,produces a bottle of champagne from behind his back I always wanted to open a bottle of champagne with one of these things.
produces a bottle of champagne from behind his back I always wanted to open a bottle of champagne with one of these things. You might wanna stand behind me for this.,Okay...
quietly Just let him in.,No.
pounding again House!,"If we just ignore him, he'll go away."
more pounding House!,whispering I think he finally left.
Just let him in.,No!
House. You can't just not show up to work. What's Cuddy gonna say?,If this is still Wilson...
Why didn't you let him in?,You were thinking about Wilson while we were having sex? That's so cool! So was I.
You were hiding me from him. Why?,I was not hiding you. I was protecting your privacy. Wasn't sure if you were ready to go public with the whole... us thing yet.
What are you doing?,You think I'm afraid to go public? I'm gonna prove you wrong.
You think I'm afraid to go public? I'm gonna prove you wrong.,"With a sex tape. We'll send it to Wilson. It's a win-win. We get to do it again, and... he might actually learn something."
whispers It sounds like someone's trying to break in. Hey.,Stuck? Bummer. Looks painful. He lowers the sword then uses it to scoop the tea kettle from the stove. Chamomile or English breakfast?
Would you stop being an ass and pull me out of here?,fills the kettle You didn't get my message earlier?
"Yeah. But as someone once told me, Everybody lies.","puts the kettle on the stove I'm fine. Just staying home, Parkll-laxin'."
"Your Patient died, you ignore my calls, and you won't open the door. I don't think you're fine. I think you might be throwing away a drug-free year.",Or... I'm ignoring you for a different reason. confidentially Sex with my girlfriend.
"Hmm. pushes at the window again Will you please just please let me in? House slides the window up then wheels the trolley and Wilson into the kitchen. After a moment, Wilson lowers his feet from the window sill and stands. Thank you. And since when did you start referring to hookers as girlfriends?",She's not a hooker.
looking around What are wha really?,"Begins with C, ends with uddy."
huge sigh How Many Vicodin have you taken?,I'm serious. Cuddy and I are now Cuddy and I. There's an I in Cuddy.
House... it's okay. Almost all addicts relapse a few times.,gesturing for Wilson to follow him She's in my bedroom.
"You're hallucinating, House.",calling as they walk down the hall Honey buns! We got company.
Pupils are normal. Pulse is normal.,Better than that. They're both totally awesome. I'm not on drugs.
So... why did you lie about Cuddy?,To make a point. PRobably something to do with shutting you up. It's my go-to idea.
"You do seem okay. You want me to stick around? I could do my usual thing of pretending I like watParkng monster truck rallies, if that would make you feel better.",No. You go.
House... you could have died. You had a Patient who did die in your arms. You shouldn't be alone.,"I know. That's why I called a hooker. hops down and escorts Wilson to the living room Now, go away. 'Cause... you'll be extra."
Are you really okay?,Are you gonna break in again? You checked my pulse. You checked my pupils. I'll mail you the urine sample.
No. I approve. Living fast and dying young is crap. If you have a chance to get better... I say good for you.,"I brought Wilson in here specifically to go public, just like you requested."
"I pressured you. Wilson coming through the window pressured you. If you're forced into this, it's not gonna work. long pause Do you have any response to that?",Game on.
Design for five points.,Got it.
Got it. Hear.,Got it. Both versions.
Love. pause. He looks up. You didn't see love.,Wow. I didn't think you'd take my lack of board game skills so personally.
Why didn't you tell me you loved me?,"Didn't a wise Woman once say and by once, I mean two hours ago why do you have to analyze Everything to death? Why can't this just be nice?"
puts down her pad I told you I loved you. You didn't tell me you loved me back. You don't think that should give me cause for concern?,No. 'Cause words don't matter. Actions matter.
You're really gonna take a stand here. You can't say,Nope.
Nope. Why?,Because... I forgot to grab a v.
"Um... France. And not Paris or the Rivera, but there's this place in NorMandy. It's on a... a tidal island. Everyone who's not staying in one of the small inns has to leave before the tide comes in. You have this 900-year-old fortress all to yourself. It's called...",Mont Saint-Michel?
That's it. Have you been there?,Nope.
Hhow did you know?,You used to have a picture of it as a screensaver.
That was years ago.,"I guess it's a memorable place. turns the computer toward himself again Now, unfortunately, we can't fly straight to NorMandy, but the layover in London's only a couple of hours."
What are you talking about?,It's all there.
I used Wilson's credit card. I can't.,I'm kidding. I used your credit card.
I used your credit card. House...,The hospital does not need your body. I do.
So does my daughter.,"Well, she can come too. Or to grandmother's House she can go."
This is crazy.,"His face starts to get the closed, guarded look it usually has. So...you break off your engagement, but you won't adjust your schedule."
"I can't. Not... tomorrow. But... two weekends from now. If Rachel's gonna stay with my mom, I'm gonna need a little bit of prep time.",His face softens and he smiles slightly. Okay.
Thank you. For Everything.,You're welcome. For Everything.
I'll see you tomorrow. She goes to the door. He hasn't moved. His head hangs a bit. I really do have to leave.,"nods, quietly I know."
What's the pRoblem?,This isn't gonna work.
That's it? You can't just... say that and shut up.,It's just a statement of fact. It's not a Debatable proposition.
Right. Because you can see the future.,No.
The only time you're afraid is when you're happy. You just don't expect it to last.,'Cause it doesn't.
You don't know that.,I've done horrible things to you.
"I don't want you to change. I know you're screwed up. I know you are always gonna be screwed up. But you're the most incredible Man I've Ever known. near tears You are always gonna be... the most incredible Man I have Ever known. So unless you're breaking up with me, I am going home now.","quietly, sincerely I love you."
smiling It's gonna be great.,almost inaudible Yeah.
That wasn't what I meant. He turns around and sees his sister on the floor. Della? You okay? Mom! Dad!,We got to stop Parking like this. People are gonna talk.
"Well, that's why I plan on doing some talking first. She pats his arm. I want us to formally report our relationship to HuMan Resources.","Okay. You get them, I'll cover Everybody else. He pushes the elevator button with the tip of his cane."
I would appreciate it if we could keep it quiet until we had that meeting.,It's gonna be hard with me grabbing your ass all day.
"Grabbing stops at the threshold... House grabs her ass, firmly she jumps a little... of the Parking garage.",Handicapped plates. I got special access. She smiles and frees herself they enter the elevator.
You haven't seen it yet.,I sense something fascinating about it.
Mom... Seriously Fine. People are gonna know soon enough. I think I can hold it till lunch. He almost smiles. Cuddy smiles back and goes to her office. House watch her going and looks quite happy.,I'm seeing Cuddy.
I'm gonna check my office for whoopee cushions.,This is not a prank.
Really? You and Cuddy?,"For realz. Foreman can translate. So Junior Miss Everything skateboarder, basketballer, science clubber, seal clubber Pauses. I'm actually guessing with that last one. Healthy one day, heart arrhythmia the next."
"EKG, echo and head CT are all spotless. There's nothing on her neurological exam.","Interesting. He points his cane at Foreman, then Taub, then Chase In favor, indignant, indifferent. Think I'd like a female perspective. Or Thirteen's. Where is she?"
"Three years, you've been trying to game out Thirteen. Now you don't care?","Sorry. Not caring about Thirteen is not part of the differential for heart arrhythmia, but you do get a home version of the game."
"Patient's brother has sEvere, congenital muscular dystrophy. Life expectancy of about 25. If she's had a latent case of it...",Wouldn't be sudden onset. Foreman!
Do you know something about Thirteen that we don't?,She's entitled to her privacy. Just as I'm entitled to a diagnosis.
And you're glossing over Thirteen's departure because you actually respect somebody's privacy?,I agree.
"If it's Long QT Syndrome, any startling stimulus in that skate Park could have triggered the arrhythmia. Loud noise, flashing lights.",Scare the Patient to death to confirm Long QT.
"Right. The guy who ordered us to stop the Patient's heart has mellowed out. It's gonna be horrible because it's doomed, which is just gonna make House 50 times more of a crank. Has an epiphany. Firecrackers! We can hide 'em under one of those covered food trays. Taub leaves hastily. Foreman looks worried.",Find any itParkng powder in your hanky? Any fake poo in your desk drawer?
"You told Everybody, didn't you?",Repeatedly. This one's not buying it. Need a little help.
"House, you've been to HuMan Resources 74 times in the last six weeks.","NEver after doing this. He bends down to kiss Cuddy, who stops him."
It's a sexual relationship.,Go slowly now. He's writing it down.
"Uh, we'll also need to watch for any favoritism toward Dr. House. House takes out a pen, hands it to Cuddy she signs the file.",Does that mean she has to sleep with Everyone?
I promise not to give him a raise or a promotion of any kind.,There's got to be a joke there about keeping up with inflation.
Or bias against him. Are there any supervisory issues with Dr. House's current case load?,"No, her case is solved. Patient has Long QT. Gonna scare her into cardiac arrest to confirm it."
"No, we're not.","Okay, no, we're not. He pockets the pen. See? Everything's under control. He smiles."
I know you're still planning your ridiculous scare test. The Patient is nowhere near sick enough to justify the risk. An angiogram and an E.P. study are much safer and very effective.,Fair point.
"I'd invite you to watch me not doing the test, but having not done it Many times before, trust me, it's pretty not interesting. House?",Scare test was not approved. Do an angio and E.P. study instead.
"House, I was expecting your relationship with Cuddy to compliCate our work long-term. House turns back, gives him a Patient, fake-polite look. I am now concerned it might be affecting us short-term. All due respect.","None taken. I listen to Cuddy all the time. She's my boss. Also yours, by the way."
"You'd listen, then tell her she's being an idiot, and do whatEver you want.","I find I can skip the idiot part when she's not being an idiot, and since the scare test would have led to the same dead end, she was right to stop it."
This should be interesting.,Losers love company.
What about protein deposits? They wouldn't show in her parents' history.,Amyloidosis. Explains both the symptoms. Marrow transplant to treat. Brother's a match. Gives Taub the file Confirm and do.
"I been experiencing fatigue, and and weakness.",Wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that you're... 102 years old.
Usually he's strong as an ox.,102-year-old ox.
He has tingling in his feet and his legs. I want a full battery of tests.,Carbon dating?
I'll pay cash if it's not covered.,That's nice of you to float your friend.
Do the tests. I'm sick.,You have a bad case of natural causes.
Do the damn tests.,"If the vial fills with sand, we take that as a bad sign."
Small pRoblem with the treatment.,Patient won't take marrow from steel wheels?
We're finding another match. And how do you know?,What other pRoblem could there be with a pRoblem-free procedure?
She loves her brother. She's thinking selflessly. How is that at all,Being moronic? Mm. If I can only think of a harm-free medical treatment she turned down lately.
"You're right. If Everyone were more selfish, the world would be a better place.",See?
"See? I can skip the idiot part when you're not being an idiot. He turns to leave the Clinic. Wilson is leaning in the doorframe, arms crossed, with a huge smile on his face.","Yeah, I had that same facial expression for the first 48 hours."
I'm happy for you. You're happy for you. This is huge. So who's gonna supervise you?,Cuddy.
"Well, I guess maybe that can work.",Maybe? Nothing's changed.
"House, Everything's changed. You're sleeping together. You want something from her besides a sign-off on scaring your Patient to death.",You talked to Taub.
He's worried about you.,He's a jerk.
I'm worried too.,Do I need to say it?
I want this to work.,I'm not doing anything differently.
"It's not Amyloidosis. Chase, Taub and a nurse take Della's bed to the OR. Taub is giving her oxygen. She gasps.",She's bleeding to death. Out of her lung. I want to fill a quarter of it with foam.
"That'd stop the bleeding, all right.",Thought it made more sense than diet and exercise.
"Scalpel, rib spreader. House is thinking hard.",I can't handle it.
"It's not completely bad, House. You care enough to pull your punches. That's not a bad thing. But you and Cuddy have got to figure out a way of avoiding this pRoblem. Set some ground rules.",Yeah Wilson looks genuinely surprised. I have to avoid this pRoblem. If I can restrict our interactions to places where neither of us are wearing pants...
"Yeah, that's not avoiding the pRoblem, that's avoiding the issue.","Since avoidance is my plan for dealing with the issue, technically, that's not avoiding it. He seems reliEved. Thanks."
This time. No guarantee bowing to Cuddy will work next time. House gives him a look.,"Heart arrhythmia, kidney failure, and now bleeding lung."
"I don't want to criticize your girlfriend, but","Hey, you've been on me for years to respect someone's opinion He starts packing."
"What about Goodpasture's? Affects the lungs, kidneys.","And autoimmune explains the out of the blue arrhythmia. Goodpasture's it is. Immunosuppressants and plasmapheresis to treat, kidney biopsy to confirm. He takes his backpack and leaves."
He takes his backpack and leaves. Dr. House.,"Don't tell me, your father's hairline is receding, and he needs more tests."
"He's 102. His next test is an autopsy. Look, I love the old Man, but I got to get him out of the damn House. He can't do anything without me. He needs to be in a care facility.","Well, so tell him. He's a big boy now."
I can't. I'm his whole life. But if it comes from a doctor... He holds out his wallet and slips House a twenty.,That's very generous. When you were 30.
I didn't run into you all afternoon. I missed you.,Busy day.
Maybe we should plan on lunch tomorrow.,"PRoblem is, at lunch you tend to wear tops.Cuddy smiles widely."
"PRoblem is, at lunch you tend to wear tops.Cuddy smiles widely. He lifts the sheet and takes a look. This is much better. Cuddy laughs. He smiles and kisses her forehead, then lifts himself and prepares to kiss her properly. The phone rings. Cuddy frowns. He reaches for his phone and answers. During the whole conversation, Cuddy caresses his forearm and traces one of his veins.",Cuddy and I are naked. So I'm having trouble focusing. Use small words.
"Kidney biopsy was clean, so we rechecked the piece of her lung from the O.R.","You lost me. Sorry, who is this calling again?"
Taub's gone to the transplant committee. They may have found a donor lung.,"So this call is purely expositional. He shuts his cell phone and throws it away, then goes back to kissing Cuddy."
I should really get dressed. I told the nanny I'd be home by 9 00.,"And I slipped the nanny 40 bucks, told her to stay till 10 00."
We know we're right about LAM. Tests confirmed it.,That leaves us with two options. Body's rejecting the new lung or we should have rejected the new lung because it's infected.
"If we give steroids for rejection, it'd make an infection worse. If we give antibiotics for infection, it'd make rejection worse.",Which worse is worse?
"If we treat for infection and we're wrong, she'll be dead within hours.",And if we treat for rejection and we're wrong?
"You're assuming her rejection's hyperacute. Odds are, it isn't.",Gotta head off the worst worse first.
"Gotta head off the worst worse first. I studied under Dr. Seuss. Start with IV methylprednisolone for hyperacute rejection. If that fails, we'll switch her to broad-spectrum antibiotics and hope we're not too late. They all get up and leave, except Taub who does not move and looks at his nails.",Cat got your legs?
"We just decided to give meds that could kill the Patient based on a guess. You need approval from Cuddy, and she'll want to take the safer course, and you're gonna fold like an origami crane, so... He takes the file. I'll just wait here till we get our actual orders.",Fine.
You want me to get Cuddy's approval?,I gotta be somewhere important.
Sitting at your desk?,I'm running late. He turns back to his office. Taub gets up and goes to see Cuddy.
"I can't do anything without him helping me like I'm senile. If I go back there, I'm gonna rip his throat out.",You sure you won't warm up to him over time?
Skip the blood work. House suppress a smile. Tell my son it's grim news. I need to be in a nursing home. A private room. Pause Make it a suite.,"Be our little secret. He pockets the note. Maurice goes to leave, but is stuck by a Very Angry Cuddy briskly entering House's office. Taub follows."
I needed to be aggressive.,You're an idiot.
The odds are against it being hyperacute rejection.,Stop.
"The new lung's ruined, and it's not rejection or infection. The only two options were wrong.",Unless it's not LAM.
It is LAM. The tests were positive.,Then the tests have to be wrong.
Deep-fryer's working again. Pointing at the salad Still working on that?,"No, it was here when I sat down. I need to think. He gets up and leaves. Wilson stills, fork in hand."
I want to make sure you're trying Everything to save my sister.,"Everything? Well, that must be it. See, I thought you guys checked the box marked, try Every other thing."
"I'm the one that's supposed to die first. I'm the damaged one, not her. She nEver Even gets a cold.",Damage has a way of spreading to Everyone around you.
"Damage has a way of spreading to Everyone around you. For example, your obvious emotional damage is now making me have a philosophical conversation instead of dealing with your sister. See how that might be damaging? House starts to leave, then stops and turn back to Hugo. NEver?","When was the last time you had a cold? Any minor aches, swelling, anything?"
It's been years. She nEver gets colds.,I didn't ask when's the last time she mentioned it. I asked when she had one Even a tiny one. He takes her oxygen mask away so she can speak.
I barely noticed it until that skateboarding tournament in Denver.,How long ago?
A... year? Cold's nothing when I think of what Hugo goes through Every day. House puts her mask back in place.,"Yeah, we get it. Your brother, the Saint. His sister, the Martyr. He leaves the room. Taubs runs after him."
"Yeah, we get it. Your brother, the Saint. His sister, the Martyr. He leaves the room. Taubs runs after him.",Thank God you followed me. Now you can go back to the transplant committee while I get confirmation.
Confirmation of what?,"What causes low-lEvel cold symptoms for a year, can ruin two lungs, is immune to drug therapies, and gets worse in cities nicknamed Mile-High?"
A clotting disorder?,She has a nasty case of sickle cell trait.
I nEver said sickle,"If Everyone were more selfish, the world would be a better place."
So she's gonna die.,Unless we can find
She burned through one donor lung. Transplant committee's nEver gonna give her a second one.,"Well, then I guess you're right again. Thinking Unless we don't need their approval."
You can't advise your Patient's parents to take marrow and half a lung from their son!,I guess I can just chat with them about the weather.
There is a huge reason not to take lungs from living Patients.,So their siblings can die?
"Their son has CMD. As it is, he's gonna die of respiratory failure by 25. We could cut whatEver time he has left in half.",That qualifies as a bad reason for them to reject the idea. It's a much worse reason for them not to get the choice.
It's coercive to tell them! You Ever hear of do no harm?,"That was second year, right? 'Cause I had mono all that fall."
Their son's not Even our Patient. Why don't we just take half a lung from some guy in the clinic with a toothache?,That's a great idea. Now we can give the parents two options.
Okay? Seriously! House turns back ands puffs.,"You made an argument. If you don't want me to defer to you, why make it at all?"
"House... we are screwing this up. I'm gonna call HR, find someone else to supervise you as soon as I can.",I've got your...
Can't my son give me round-the-clock care?,"Not unless you've done your two-year certification in tiburon swab technology. Maurice winks and nods in approval. House nods back, slightly."
There must be some other way. Just because he has a little tingling and some trouble feeling hot and cold and some difficulty,You can't feel hot and cold?
Not lately. But at my age...,Show me your teeth.
Why would he carry denture cream?,Because...
About a tube a day. I buy it online House smiles lightly. So what does this mean?,"Bizarrely, it explains all your symptoms."
"The transplant committee's... nEver gonna give my daughter another lung, are they?",No.
Are there any other options?,We're looking into it.
Looking into what? Please. Tell me. Give me some kind of hope.,I'm afraid I can't do that.
"We're talking about my daughter's life. What can't you tell me? If there's any... chance you can save her, anything you can try...",We can take marrow and half a lung from your son.
How long... do we have to decide?,Morning at the latest.
HR can't find you a new supervisor.,How come?
"Because you're unsupervisable, House. Two department chairs threatened to quit.","Well, I guess we're stuck with each other."
You told them?,I told him. He came to my office. I'm sorry.
Well... I should pRobably be more mad at you.,Yeah.
"House! During the whole following exchange, they yell at each other",Are you gonna pretend that you're not choosing your own daughter's death?
Our daughter doesn't want it.,PRobably doesn't wanna floss her teeth either. She's a mindless teenybopper.
Don't put this on them.,"What do you mean, put it on? It is on them! As much as they may wanna pass the lung here!"
Of course they do! You're handing them an impossible choice.,"Life has handed them a crappy choice, and they're picking the crappier option trading who knows how Many healthy decades for four or five years in which roller boy will"
Not Everything is a math equation.,Do you need me to explain the difference between decade and year?
"Their son is a huMan being. You know what they are, right? Intrinsic value. We don't get to decide",And we do it Every day. If the two of them needed the same lung
He needs to keep the one he's got. You don't get to play God by ripping out,"That train left the station when we learned to do transplants. The rest is just paper-pushing. Of course, now we're on to your real area of expertise."
"You do so Many great things. I just watch. I get to watch and coach and cheer. But that's not me out there. It nEver will be. If you take this piece of me, carry it with you... then I really can share in Everything you do. The parents stare at them. This is the great thing I can do with my life. Don't make me live without you.",We got lucky. Pushes the elevator button with his cane. I did give them an impossible choice. The kid took it away from them.

In an adult relationship.,Name one thing that Cuddy and I have in common besides work.
There's... You're both... Wait.,"Exactly. Long-term relationships are based on compatibility, and right now we only have sex."
"House, you don't actually think she'd dump you because you, what, don't do yoga? Listen to the B-52s?","Not right away. We'll fight, makeup sex, fight, maybe sex, and then she'll dump me. With possible goodbye sex."
"So, instead of enjoying the Honeymoon phase, you've decided to skip it entirely.",I need to find something that we both like doing besides each other.
Right. Or you could just talk to her about it.,"No, then she'll start pretending to like things that she really doesn't just to make me feel better, which will make her feel Even worse, which won't be my fault, so I'll resent her, and that won't be her fault, so she'll resent me."
There's nothing wrong with me. My maid just overreacted.,Great. He pushes aside the curtain with his cane This won't take long then.

"Ah, yes, the age-old hooker massage conundrum. Cuddy might have mentioned something about it. Let's say you're right. Completely right about Everything. Give in anyway.",This is not a point of pride. This is a point of principle.
"Right, you're the Rosa Parks of hooker massages.","The principle is she's being irrational. If I give in on this, it sets the stage for the whole relationship."
"Putting up with irrationality is the foundation for Every relationship. I agree with Sam when she's calling her father a monster. I agree with her when she's calling him a saint. And in exchange, I get to have sex with her. And I'm sure she has similar tradeoffs with me. Relationships are hard. You have to make sacrifices. So sacrifice being crazy. Go get her a gift and apologize.",You finally made a good point.
"Which, clearly, you have misunderstood based on how quickly you agreed.",leaving The kitchen's burning.
What are you doing?,Just letting you all share in the joys of my last trip to Carlsbad Caverns.
"Yeah, she'd love to become a target for your ridicule.",She isn't already?
Normal EKG. No osler nodes.,"Right, Dr. Kelly!"
Kelly's her first name.,"What's your point, Dr. Robert?"
I already did. No vegetations. Valves are clear.,Snapilicious!
Is that!? That's baby Chase and his mama! That's adorable!,"NEver mind the baby, peep the babe. Note the cheekbones and eye shape."
They do actually look alike.,"I know what you're thinking, Chase wants to sleep with his mom. But who wouldn't hit that if that looked like that? It's a classic case of what Freud called"
This isn't about Chase's mother. You're wrong.,What do you mean he's wrong? It is about your mom?
It is about your mom? No.,So it's about!
All we know is we don't see it. Dehydration from the fEver could hide the pneumonia.,"Okay, forget the mom theory. Go water the Patient, treat for Legionnaire's."
Whose idea was Legionnaire's? Dr. Chase's.,"Well, you get major points for trying to trick me."
Seriously? A massage from a male hooker?,He was? Huh. That doesn't bother me at all. I guess we both learned a valuable lesson.
"Except that I didn't used to have sex with him, you idiot! Plus, he was a gay hooker.",Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a straight male hooker?
I'm sure that some part of you beliEves this idiocy. But you can't possibly be stupid enough to think that you can convince any part of me. And that can only mean you're trying to sabotage this relationship.,Why would I do that? We're doing fine.
"Because the next step from fine is serious, and you can't handle that, so you're trying to keep me at arm's length with all this crap.",How about you?
I have been completely open with you.,You won't let me sleep over. You basically haven't introduced me to your daughter.
But do you want to spend time with her?,"Honestly! before this, I'd have said no. But! yeah. How are we Ever gonna be a couple if you keep hiding her from me?"
"House! I need to protect her. I let you into her life, and you go away!",Call it what it is. I'm not the only one who's holding back.
What's happening to her?,"It's hit her brain, whatEver it is."
It could be nothing.,Which would get us nowhere. So let's assume it's something. What kind of something?
"But her delusions are consistent with mental illness. Bipolar disease, for example. She's 30. It could he hitting her right now for the first time.","So her mind just happens to fall apart right after her body? Wow, I thought I was having a bad week."
I know it sounds coincidental!,"You know what, I'm back to the Cameron theory. That you hired the dumb version of Cameron so that you could fire her and get rEvenge."
Give her a break.,"Oh, you've switched sides? Let me guess, Chase represents the dumb version of Thirteen!"
"I realized if we all just keep pressuring Kelly, of course she's gonna get stuff wrong. It's irresponsible of me to let that happen.",You are a true leader of men. Get someone to cut into her head and get me a biopsy.
"So relapsing, remitting fEver. Malaria. Dengue.","Why wasn't she frozen? This morning? Put a healthy person on a cooling blanket, they'd be Parklled like a fine Chardonnay. She's a nice warm Merlot. 98.6 all day."
I didn't want her to freeze.,"So you titrated the blanket. As her fEver dropped, you lowered the power."
"As her fEver dropped, you lowered the power. Exactly.",So it's been on the lowest setting since when?
So it's been on the lowest setting since when? Yesterday afternoon.,Which means we could have known that her fEver was gone yesterday afternoon.
The antibiotics. Without vomiting?,When did she last puke?
Not since she was admitted.,Two down. Shooting for three.
You're gonna turn her pacemaker off? You sure that's a good idea?,"Nope. But it might be. He disconnects it. Nothing happens. No tachycardia, there's only the delusions left. If they're Even still there."
But it could have been prompted by the physical symptoms.,epiphany You couldn't be more wrong.
Call me when she wakes. Still hallucinating.,Can you hear me? What are you looking at?
"The table, it's on fire.","If it was, think I'd be able to do this! places hand in fire without screaming for my mommy? The flames disappear."
The flames disappear. Thank you.,Don't be too impressed.
Her doctor's not in Trenton.,"Not the one you know about. If you haven't figured it out by now, your wife has a secret."
What the hell is he talking about? Is it about your ex?,"The ex was not so much a secret, more of a lie."
Know-know about what?,She's sick.
Billy! I'm sParkzophrenic.,That's the kind of thing that a recent psyParkatric resident might have figured out.
What the hell am I supposed to do now?,Nothing. Her physical symptoms are gone. We'll put her on a different anti-psychotic for the mental ones. You can take a nap.
This is not who I married.,Of course she is. You just didn't know it.
I don't know if I can stay with her.,"Sorry, as your marriage counselor, I'm not allowed to talk to you without your wife present."
Just-just tell me how hard it would be for us to handle this. Medically.,"Look, if you want me to give you a reason to leave her, fine. Apparently you haven't noticed, but she's got a serious mental illness."
It's too hard.,It's always hard.
"Okay, so I made a mistake. Kelly will make a fine doctor, but she's not ready for the team.",Up to you.
What? You like her now?,"Nope. But she got me to the right answer, which none of the rest of you did. If you want to give her another shot, go for it."
Okay. I will.,"Great. It'll make it easier for you to sleep with her. He leaves the elevator, talking over his shoulder to Chase. Come on, why else would you have hired her?"
What are you doing?,I got bored with the porn on my computer.
You done with Brandi?,Ehh! Knobby hands.
"I will get you the name. Let's stay at my place tonight, okay?",Will you get cable?
Will you get cable? No.,Then we'll have to have more sex.
You want some more meat?,"This is meat? She smiles. Yes, please. He hands her his plate and smiles."
"This is meat? She smiles. Yes, please. He hands her his plate and smiles.","Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, kid. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. He gently pries the cane from her hands and mouth. Hey, hey, hey."

What's happening? a hand partially obscures the camera lens What's wrong with my baby? the camera swings downward towards the floor Why doesn't someone talk to me?!,Cancel your dinner plans.
I need you a minute. she heads into House's office,brief pause Silent reading time till I get back. he follows Cuddy
My nanny called. Her daughter has a dance recital tonight. She can't work late. House eyes her in confusion And I have a board meeting tonight.,shrugs That's a pRoblem.
My mother can't come. She has a cooking class.,"Oh, you've really got a pRoblem."
sarcastically If only there were... some mature adult in my life who could pinch hit in emergencies like this.,"Love to, but I'm catParkng up on my back issues of Nudist Circus. You should see what the fat lady's got under her big top."
All I need is a warm body. She'll be asleep the entire time.,I got a sick baby here who needs me. Yours is healthy.
You could deal with your team by phone.,How about a little something extra when you get home?
"I'm not bargaining sex for babysitting. Besides, you owe me.",For what?
Sex! I still don't see a female doctor in that room. It's making me very unhappy.,"Fine. Out of the goodness of my heart, which will make you happy, which will make you desire me more, which will turn into more sex."
The sperm donor card from the father did note a history of asthma.,What if her lung pRoblems are not coming from her lungs?
Her liver enzymes are elevated.,"When the liver fails, it stops producing proteins."
Do you want me to hire a white girl?,"Go find a Woman, and wipe that self-satisfied grin off your face."
This'll be quick. I've been interviewing people all week. I have it narrowed down to two candidates.,"Well, narrow it down to one before Cuddy starts withholding sex."
"smirks Uh, she hasn't said anything to me about that.","I said, wipe the grin. he leaves the room. Foreman looks after him almost affectionately."
I'll check again. I'm thirsty.,"Your mommy says no, 'cause she's mean. shrugs If it was up to me..."
shrugs If it was up to me... Juice!,No. Go back to bed. she runs into the dining room instead. I said bed! she looks back at him mockingly and heads around the table

No. long pause. He's leans closer to the phone Are... you okay?,"sitting on Cuddy's couch with Rachel, attempting to calm her down Just talking in a soothing voice."
"House, there's someone here I need you to meet. I just hired Dr. Christina Fraser. She's a board certified","Nice to meet you. high, squeaky voice You're fired."
What did I do?,You had the misfortune to be the lesson that Foreman is learning. That whooshing sound is the air being let out of his ego.
"angrily You are such an ass, House. You could have made the same point without crushing the hopes of a young doctor who was actually excited to have this job.","No, I'm not sure I could have."
For you to fire?,Not until you or she earns it. cut back to team Dilated bile ducts could be congenital.
That means that it's a stricture in the ducts themselves. Caroli's syndrome.,"So, open her up."
You told me you gave them your credit card...,And you were dumb enough to beliEve me.

shocked You're not gonna leave the kid?,"Yes, I am. he begins putting on his coat 'Cause unlike you, I don't have a conscience."
You're not gonna leave a two-year-old unattended.,Sure. I'm leaving her with you. A responsible adult. he opens the door and leaves
Better get back in there. Kid's all alone. they walk down Cuddy's front yard towards the street.,"It's kind of bugging you, isn't it?"
Not my pRoblem.,"they descend the steps to the sidewalk Well, since, objectively, you care more about leaving a Parkld alone than I do, it kind of is."
"Objectively, since I nEver accepted this responsibility, it kind of isn't. he opens his car door","mounts his motorcycle True, and yet it is. Because you're you."
"mounts his motorcycle True, and yet it is. Because you're you.",I'm leaving.
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.,confidently You're not gonna leave. You can't. Wilson struggles with that for a minute
"he turns his engine off and gets out of the car Fine. You're right. he walks up to House You know what I can do? I can go in there and call a babysitting service for 15 bucks an hour, then call Cuddy and tell her who's watParkng her kid and why.","he considers that, then turn off his engine as well. I'll stay if you stay. Wilson stands there for a long moment."
he and House still frozen ...We were gone two minutes.,"still appearing rather shellshocked What have you got there, sweetie? Rachel looks amused. Wilson kneels cautiously in front of her."

"perusing the restaurant menu Okay... you ordered the moo shoo pork... and the orange cashew Parkcken, right?",Like I always order. Did you clean up in there?
Like I always order. Did you clean up in there?,"shrugs Well, he could have shortchanged you. Fridge magnet's not getting anything."
"exasperatedly That's because it's a fridge magnet! Unless she swallowed a Canadian dime, it's not magnetic.","Really? Wilson nods I mean, kids swallow things all the time, right? Wilson shrugs I mean, she swallowed a dime, she poops it out. She'll be fine."
"If you don't tell Cuddy, I will go out there and tell her myself!",hissing Yeah?
"hissing Yeah? What are you gonna tell her? Are you gonna tell her that... you left coins out? he advances on Wilson, who backs away And you left her Parkld unsupervised?!",outraged You're telling me to do the right thing while climbing out a window!
"enters the hall Did she wake up at all? House looks guilty, but says nothing",...One time.
immediately worried That's not like her... is she all right?,She's fine. Cuddy smiles and kisses him How about I stay the night? Then you can really thank me.
I have to get up early. You won't be able to sleep in.,"I'm a deep sleeper. Cuddy smiles and heads into her bedroom. House starts to follow her, but stops to look guiltily at Rachel's door."
Cheng looks at him questioningly Half-awake Huh?,"leans over her for a split-second, then leaves the room at a run Relax, I got this."
bemused Oh... thanks.,"cringes at the smell Pfft! Rachel laughs. House puts a small light in his mouth and begins examining the contents of Rachel's diaper. Cuddy wanders in, still looking half-awake."
Is Everything okay?,"snatches the light out of his mouth Yeah, sorry, I'm just... new to all this."
You want me to reset the alarm?,"opens one eye God, no. Case is under control. I'm sleeping in."
"Hey, Marina! House jumps up Pasta's in the fridge","I assume, since you're calling so early, that the surgery was a rousing success."
"And I assume, since you still think we actually did the surgery, you haven't checked your messages in eight hours. Where are you?",I beliEve this is what your people term a poopy call.
"chuckles confusedly Uh, the word is booty.","Well, I don't know what you're doing, but this is a poopy call."
It's not Caroli's syndrome. Dr. Cheng spotted a,"confusedly Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?! I know about the Jew, the black, and the croc-hunter, but when did we get our Asian persuasion on?"
exasperated Dr. Cheng... is the NICU attending on the case. And she's not here.,"Well, then I just wasted a perfectly good racial epithet."
She spotted a vascular malformation in the baby's liver.,Good call... Except for Everything you just said. There's no way that our Patient has a vascular malformation. stands up from Cuddy's bed.
And you can tell that from the vast amount of information you've gleaned from not being here?,Don't need to be there to remember that the Patient's A.L.T.s were three times normal. The baby's liver damage is far too extensive. Dr. Cheng's an idiot.
"In fairness, it wasn't completely her idea. More of a Foreman kinda thing. Foreman looks indignant, and Taubs shrugs at him.","Well, then you're an Even bigger idiot for trying to cover for her."
"House, we treated for a vascular malformation, and she got better!","pause No, she didn't. Call me when she crashes again. hangs up"
"quietly All right, she's in her office. Move fast.","cautiously pushing the cart inside You see a double-wide tuchus coming this way, you scream like a girl."
"nervously If Rachel wakes up, she's gonna tell Cuddy Everything.",She's two!
puts his outspread hands up to his temples Hello... I'm the friendly moose who lives outside your bedroom. Rachel looks upset and pulls her shirt up over her eyes.,annoyed She hates that moose.
to Rachel ...Okay.,"to Taub over the phone Make it short. And do not pardon the pun. Wilson gestures for the ultrasound wand, and House hands it to him."
choppy and indistinct She's crashing again. Where are you?,"backs into the door, where a no cell phones' sign is visible Is it actually important that I understand what you say?"
What? the call disconnects,Yeah?
The baby's bleeding again.,"I'm shocked! Oh, no, wait a minute that's you."
"looking at the ultrasound monitor House, come take a look at this.",Hold that thought. he presses the phone into his shoulder and goes to stand next to Wilson.
points at the screen Just past the ileocecal valve.,worried It's nothing. It's just an irregularity.
It's a dime!,Or a pocket of air.
"Yeah, with FDR's face on it.",That's not a face. It's a shadow.
"House, the thing is perfectly round.","Well, move the wand to the side."
Gonna tickle you Even more! to House Look atlook at that.,shakes his head We need an X-ray to be sure.
I saw your extension on the call. What are you doing down here?,"Uh, Wilson's got a two-year-old with cancer. She's in a lot of pain. It's very sad."
"Uh, Wilson's got a two-year-old with cancer. She's in a lot of pain. It's very sad.",He also has an outstanding bedside Manner. Taub still looks suspicious
...Her liver failure is getting worse. You were right. Now what?,"The interesting question is not why she's worse now, but why she got better in the first place."
Could have been something we did that temporarily reliEved the,What'd you put her on again?
"After the transfusion, we gave her steroids, dopamine, and the anti pauses steroids can treat idiopathic hepatic fibrosis. It would explain why she got better and then worse.",But not the multiple dilated ducts.
"from inside the room House, I need you back in here! Taub looks at House pleadingly","Cancer kid trumps liver kid. he enters the room and Taub tries to follow him. Sorry. Confidentiality. There are rules, you know. he slams the door in Taub's face"
That... is a dime.,looks at the monitor It looks mobile.
"to Rachel Sounds to me like someone's going to get some yummy chocolate. he imitates a chewing motion with his hand, and Rachel does the same.",looks at Wilson and takes the ultrasound wand back from him You're gonna make a great mommy one day.
...And what else?,"Nothing else. He retreats into the exam room, and Taub gapes at the door."
looks at the Parkld It's amazing. She's pink and healthy again.,Mother's touch.
A blood transfusion isn't a cure.,Or a miracle.
quietly Then why does the baby seem like she's cured?,I have no idea.
I have no idea.,"Our Patient can either go through life with the world's longest umbilical cord, or we can discuss the differential for magic blood."
smiles and approaches them Baby's O2-stats,"Either you're Dr. Cheng, or you're early for my Mani-pedi."
I thought her expertise could,Could tell us the O2-stats. speaks to Cheng I hope you come with some original ideas. Chase does a double-take.
"Either the mom's blood is special, which would mean it's treating something specific, which means the baby has a disease... Or mom's blood is just blood, and it's replacing something the baby is missing, which means the baby has a simple deficiency.","Given the liver failure, a deficiency of clotting factors, enzymes, or vitamins are the most likely."
So let's find out. Hook the baby up to someone else's blood and see if she gets better.,Find a donor.
"I'm O Negative, universal donor.","Hook yourself up. Dr. Cheng, hook me up. Walk with me. they head down the hall. My team seems to have taken a shine to you."
I like them too.,I assume you're hanging around because you want a job.
That would be a fair assumption.,"Well, I'm gonna have to test you. Let's say, two-year-old... swallowed a coin twenty hours ago. She's gonna be fine, right?"
Any signs of obstruction?,"For the purposes of this quiz, let's say not yet."
"I'd give a laxative, although I wouldn't wait too long. Her bowel could become ischemic, or worse, an intussusception.",look uncomfortable Define too long.
"Another six hours, max. By then, her system is clear. If it's not out, it's not coming out.","And then what do I do? hastily I mean, what do you do? It's your test."

It's worth having someone on the team who doesn't see the world entirely as shades of gray.,It is gray!
She has a fresh perspective. Unless that threatens you. She enters the elevator.,"It does not! sighs You thought I'd get defensive, keep her out of pride."
"It's not just your liver we have to worry about. Looks like your kidneys are having pRoblems, too.",So this guy spends his entire life campaigning against bleeding hearts. And it turns out he has one.
"Bloody urine actually is a renal pRoblem, not a cardiac one.","Yeah, if I say something inaccurate, assume it's for comic effect. Then laugh,"
"H.S.P. Doesn't usually cause clots, but it can. And the vasculitis would explain the kidney pRoblem.","She can't diagnose a joke, but she's making progress on the Patient."
We treat with chemotherapy or steroids.,We treat with chemotherapy.
I said chemo.,"Then you said, or."
"Once again, the bunny meets the blade.","The road to dead Patients is paved with ors. Chemo is the more effective treatment, which means it'll confirm our diagnosis more quickly."
"I agree, but there is another option.","There are lots of other options. There's bloodletting, crystals, prayer!"
Another medically accepted option.,"Which is both less effective and less scary. So the Patient might just choose it. Unless, of course, we don't mention it to him."
We can't withhold information. If we explain both the benefits and the risks of each treatment I'm sure Dugan will choose chemo.,"Well, as long as you're sure."
I'll take the steroids.,"Oh, my goodness! He was standing behind Masters If only someone could've predicted that you'd make that incredibly stupid decision. Masters looks at House"
"Doctor, can you talk some sense into him?","Would that I could, but ethics dictate that it's his decision."
"I was just down by Dugan's room. They were ready to give him the wrong medicine. I tried to change the order, but I'm not a doctor.",Good. The wrong medicine is the right medicine.
"But he wanted steroids, not chemo.",He wants to live.
I'm gonna tell him what's going on. leaving,"No, you're not. he takes off his glasses I don't mind your morality in theory. But in practice, you're risking my Patient's life. So you're fired."
You think that's gonna stop me from telling him?,"If you do, I'll get you thrown out of medical school."
"If you do, I'll get you thrown out of medical school.","I know. But unlike you, I'm willing to lie."
"Firing her was a mistake. We need someone like her on the team, keeping us all in check.",You're incapable of noticing when I do something inappropriate?
Things have been just fine without Pippi Longdivision.,Your opponent's out of the race. You can drop the smear campaign.
Masters was right. He didn't want the chemo. He didn't need the chemo.,Masters was wrong. He doesn't have H.S.P. And Masters is gone.
SParkstosomiasis wouldn't respond to aztreonam.,That's a great idea if he was running a political campaign in Africa. The guy hasn't been out of the country in years.
"Who needs to travel when you've got a giant fish tank loaded with tropical fish, tropical snails carrying tropical bacteria like sParkstosomiasis?","Well, break into his home, get me some escargots. Unless you wanna ask the Patient's permission as a tribute to the departed."
You said you were gonna give her a chance.,I did! She used that opportunity to endanger our Patient's life.
By insisting he receives the treatment that he asked for.,That's what I just said!
"She's a potential star, and I want her in my hospital.",No pRoblem. Just find her a different department. He leaves the office with one last glance at Masters.
Let's get out of here. Hello?,Yeah.
Yeah. It's Foreman.,What'd you find?
"Nothing helpful, but!",There's gotta be something. Dugan's going completely downhill. Now fluid's collecting in his chest. Where the hell are you guys?
In jail. You gonna come bail us out?,Uh! kinda busy. He hangs up.
Uh! kinda busy. He hangs up.,There you are.
"As I recall, you have three actual doctors you haven't fired today.",They're in jail.
They're in jail. What? Why?,Prostitution. So you're rehired.
Prostitution. So you're rehired.,"Yeah, I don't need to hear your ideas. Just return the volley."
Primary sclerosing cholangitis.,Nope. His vitamin A lEvel is normal.
Gall bladder pRoblems can affect the liver.,Cholecystitis?
Gall bladder pRoblems can affect the liver. Cholecystitis?,Did you just shush me?
I think he's lying. Dugan said!,The technical term is speaking.
"Dugan violated my trust. And therefore, I have no other recourse than to fire him from my campaign. Thank you, and there will be no further questions. House gets up. He just figured out something.",He screwed you.
"That was a hell of a move. Use the ad to shore up the base, fire the extremist to hold the center.","No, I mean he actually screwed you."
"That's great, but the Senator and I have not had sex.","Well, then the two of you shot up together."
How Many high-functioning heroin users do you know?,"Actually, quite a few."
"You can get hep C from doing cocaine? Look, I will deny it.",Don't care.
What is that?,This is interferon. It delays the onset of rigor mortis. He leaves.
Mystery solved. Now we can all go back to our lives.,Great news. I've decided to rehire you.
Find another sounding board.,Dugan's got hep C.
I'm not doing this.,He's not responding to interferon.
You must think I have absolutely no self-esteem. She stops and turns to House.,Ethics and self-esteem? You really are a pain in the ass. What treats hep C besides interferon?
Now you want me to talk?,Yeah.
Now you want me to talk? Yeah.,"Come on, stop pretending you're not gonna do this. As much as you hate me, you hate failing more."
I didn't fail. You fired me. Repeatedly.,"But if you walk away now, after I just rehired you, that's quitting."
"A GerMan research study showed that 15% of Patients with hep C were cured after contracting hep A. Of course, other studies have shown that up to 85% of doubly-infected Patients die very quickly. So, in theory, if we can find something that mimics hep A!",There's one thing that mimics hep A! Hep A. Good work. Heading off the elevator. You're fired.
You're fired. No!,Hep A could cure him.
Better chance it'll kill him.,Tell the lab to release a hep A culture to me. We'll see who's right.
That's an extremely cowardly position.,Listen to the genius.
"If you really think that this is the only way to cure him, I will risk the lawsuit. But I need to know that he actually has the disease. Get me proof.",I've given you!
"Proof! Get me proof he has hep C, and then you can give him hep A.",I can't.
You'll figure something out. The two of you have combined I.Q. North of 300.,That's also true of five morons. He leaves.
So what do we do now?,"Well, considering the fact that I'm about to do something unethical!"
"Oh, right, yeah! I'm fired.",Missed you.
I'm fired. Missed you.,We need a false positive hep C test.
And why would we want to do that?,The world changes when you're on the inside. You just gotta roll with it once you get out.
"You think he contracted hep C from the Senator, right? Test Anderson. If it's positive, that's evidence Dugan has it, too.","Evidence, not proof."
Are we presenting this to a jury of our peers? That should be enough for Cuddy.,"Should be, but it won't be."
"The test for hep C is 99.9% accurate. That means one in Every thousand test is a false positive. We do enough, maybe we get lucky. disgusted I smell like jail.","False false positive. That's the best we can do? Okay, go do it."
I think you pRobably already know the answer.,But it doesn't make any sense.
You don't understand why a Woman might be upset because her boyfriend lied to her?,I wouldn't be lying as her boyfriend. I'd be lying as her employee.
That's not how relationships work.,My Patient is gonna die.
Does the lie guarantee he'll live?,No.
"Now that you're my doctor, you, uh! You can't tell anybody, right?",Who'd leak a story about a sitting senator who got hep C from doing cocaine?
Who'd leak a story about a sitting senator who got hep C from doing cocaine? You didn't fill out any paperwork. I'm gonna run this test under an assumed name. Trust me! No one will Ever know you were here. He writes Dugan's name on the blood vial.,"Blood test confirming hep C. He got sicker, his viral load came up, finally showed up on the test."
Thank you. There was a time when you would have completely ignored my request. That means a lot that you respect me enough to do this.,"I've come a long way, baby."
"I've come a long way, baby.",I'm on it. He leaves.
I'm on it. He leaves.,How'd you like to come work for me?
It's like I'm on a Mobius strip.,We've had this conversation. You want this job.
We've had this conversation. You want this job.,"Prove yourself to me, no more games. At least, the current game ends. Others may start. You have my deeply-flawed word."
What do I have to do?,Get Dugan to let us give him hep A.
I'm not gonna lie to him.,You have a math degree.
"Well, technically, it works infinitely better because arsenic has a 0% chance. This is your only shot. Both Dr. House and I beliEve that. He faked a blood test in order to get you approved for this treatment. And then he tried to bribe me into lying to you about the risks. If either of those incidents came to light, he would be suspended and pRobably lose his license.","Oh, I'm sure some other people would suffer."
I did it. And I didn't have to lie.,And you feel good about that?
And you feel good about that? Yes.,So I'm hiring an idiot.
"You can pretend you wanted me to lie, but you didn't. You want the people on your team to challenge you otherwise you'd just be a bully instead of a great doctor. You hired me because I don't compromise my principals.",Or I want a front row seat when you wake up and realize how useless your principals are.
It's not gonna happen.,See you tomorrow.
Nothing. I'll see you upstairs.,"If I knew hiring her meant dealing with medical school paperwork, I might've reconsidered. You really got nothing better to do than watch me sign this?"
And miss the ultimate admission that I was right about Masters all along?,She had me when she called you a coward. You gonna hang out?
Get her a towel. What was in that jar?,Why aren't you guys in my office?
Why are you in the building? It's 800 in the morning.,Where's Chase? He hands the file to Foreman.
He's not here because it's 800 in the morning.,"16-year-old girl high fEver, vomiting, bloodshot eyes."
Wow. The case of the really bad flu.,"Hmm, let me see. Did I leave anything out? Oh, yeah. The smallpox. A few seconds of startled silence."
Smallpox was eradiCated over 30 years ago.,So were Hush Puppies. Have you checked out your local hipster coffee shop lately?
Smallpox doesn't exist outside of P4 Labs and bio weapon plants.Waving the file She was in Bermuda.,"Where she was scuba diving on the wreck of a Dutch slave ship, that had been intentionally sunk, because an epidemic of smallpox had broken out on board."
Was the ship sunk in water? Because viruses can't survive contact with water.,"If the virus had been kept on the outside of an airtight jar, that might be an issue."
The virus can't survive over 200 years.,You have.
"Well, theoretically, yes, but","Thank you. He flips the phone shut. So who do we beliEve CDC or Dr. 90210? Isolate, get baseline blood draws for smallpox antibodies and vaccinate the entire family."
We should test for the 21st-century suspects varicella and measles.,"You're free to perform whatEver unnecessary tests you want, Foreman. Slavery was abolished years ago."
How do I not panic with that information? Niles and Roger look frozen.,Idiot in exam room one needs antidiarrheals and a dictionary.
You're not scheduled for clinic duty now.,I had some free time. I owed four hours.
Don't you have a case?,Yeah.
Don't you have a case? Yeah.,Are you a Stepford doctor?
"If you're busy, you don't need to be down here.",You're serious.
What if I get someone to sit with her while you run home and get Lamby? I'll get a nurse. Showing his phone Then I have to deal with a! very sick Man.,I think she knows.
"Who is she, and what does she know?",Cuddy. And! that I faked a lab test and lied to her to save my last Patient.
What did she do?,She let me out of clinic duty by saying I had a case. She's nEver done that.
"You don't. If she doesn't know, all you're gonna do by sniffing around is make her suspicious. If she does know, you'll find out soon enough.",What if I die of curiosity in the meantime?
That's none of your business.,"Ah, pRobably just a dry spell."
"House, you do realize we just ruled out smallpox?",You passive/aggressive bitch.
You just asked me,What about Foreman's unnecessary tests?
Negative for varicella and measles. So all of our ideas are off the table.,"I'm putting mine back on. Patient's a diver. Under increased pressure, Everything in the blood gets scared, panics, runs, and hides."
Antibodies could be in the joints.,"Tap her knee, ankle, shoulder, and any other joint in her smallpox-ridden body. To Masters Good talk."
"Tap her knee, ankle, shoulder, and any other joint in her smallpox-ridden body. To Masters Good talk.",You know.
'Cause I wanted you to come to me and apologize.,I can't apologize if I haven't done anything wrong.
There are treatments. We can give you cidofovir.,I don't think you care about the drugs' names.
What would purple blotches mean? Hemorrhagic-type smallpox.,"In which case, her chances are more like! Shaq hitting a free throw."
Like more of those gross bumps?,No. It's just a regular rash.
W-what does that mean?,It means it's not smallpox. The parents look reliEved and hug.
"Please step out of the room. I'm Dr. Broda, Head of Infection control, CDC, and your protective suits are not adequate.",Turns out they don't have to be.
Rash is consistent with smallpox.,Not if it presents after pustules.
"She's pRobably just allergic to the bedsheets or the hospital gown, and you simply didn't notice it House and Taub exchange looks. We're gonna airlift blood and tissue samples to Atlanta. We'll have the DNA results in 18 hours. In the meantime, please, step out of the room.",You brought the plane? Cool.
"When we left, Julie's fEver had climbed to over 103.",You know how you can tell there's nothing to be done? Chase showed up.
It's the middle of the night in the Netherlands. Nobody's working.,"Oh, you can always find someone."
Just do the translation.,She can translate howEver she feels most comfortable.
"House, the hospital has translators on call","Shut up. He enters his card number, then turns back and hands out Masters a post-it. Honey, could you email our new friend the Captain's log?"
"On morning of 14, July, I boarded Sotos Ooslerzoon with two trunks and my cat. Aw! The Captain had a cat.",Isn't she adorable? Go ahead and skip to the part where people get sick.
"Mm, no. It say only African men sick.",It can't be smallpox. Airborne transmission means it's an equal-opportunity killer. We're looking for a disease that discriminates.
Captain and crew got clean drinking water. Slaves drank whatEver they could. Scrofula. That's what they called cervical T.B. lymphadenitis in the 1700s.,Scrofulicious that's what they called annoying in the 1700s.
"T.B. might fit, but it's too slow-moving to kill her anytime soon. There's no way the CDC's gonna give us access.","That's why we don't think it's T.B. We think it's meningococcal disease, which could kill her before the results come back."
"And once I gain access, I run the T.B. Test. You could have said all that in there.",In front of the narc? As if.
"Are you so afraid of this new girl, we have to take elaborate measures Every time you want to skirt around ethical boundaries?","Elaborate measures? We took a walk a walk you would have taken anyway. Actually, I saved you from the horrible post-differential traffic jam."
This is not meningococcus. You're not getting in here.,Cool.
Not really not for them and not for you the dad's new symptoms are consistent with them having smallpox.,Would be if he had a headache.
He does have a headache.,"No. He just said, ow, and held his head."
"Actually, he said, ow.Then he said, it's a headache.",Which could be indicative of head pain.
We're back to T.B.?,We nEver left.
We'll need to do a C.T. And I sort of have a hunch that the CDC's not gonna approve of us moving the Patient.,"Chase, can I talk to you outside for a second? Masters looks suspicious."
You just tried this. I'm not a better liar than Foreman.,"Sure, you are."
That's 60-year-old technology that killed Patients.,Exactly. He'll compromise on the C.T.
You don't trust me.,Going behind your back works better when you're not facing us.
"Instead of whatEver lie you're gonna tell Broda, why don't you just tell him the truth? House looks desperate If we are honest and reasonable",People of all races and creeds will live together in peace and harmony.
How did your first plan work out?,Permission granted.
Thank you. She leaves them. House turns back to Chase.,"After she gets denied, do the bait and switch."
"Yeah. I'll be right back. to Sam, who now looks deflated. You know, I'm pretty sure Lamby has a cousin down in the gift shop.","Hold off a minute. I'm in overtime. He tries again, loses. Masters jumps a little, surprised, then giggles. Oh!"
"Uh, Broda agreed to C.T. the dad's brain.","Well, that sucks."
But I thought that's what you wanted.,I shouldn't have gotten it with the truth. He's a hypocrite. His position Ever since he's been here has been
"I-I pointed out that either we're right, and he's the hero for ending the crisis, or he's right, and he gets to be the first person to look at a brain infected with smallpox. C.T. scans weren't around 30 years ago.",Good work.
So I guess honesty is the best policy.,"Why'd you say that? Seriously! To establish your viewpoint, as if I didn't already know it, or to demonstrate some weird cross-generational female solidarity with Cuddy?"
"Actually, I was just trying to fill the awkward silence.",Oh. Looking back to the CDC crew. They are wheeling the dad back in his room. Why have they stopped? He opens the door and enters the hallway.
You can't go out there.,Why did you stop?
Get out of the hallway.,He does not have smallpox.
He's just dEveloped pustules. He's now too dangerous to transport. Get out of the hallway.,What about the daughter?
Pustule count is way up. Vitals are way down.,"Means I was wrong. But to be precise, I was right before I was wrong, so!"
We might as well keep,"We have our diagnosis. If you're eager, you can go find us a new case. Masters leaves."
Julie doesn't have smallpox.,Did I just dream the part where I finally agreed it was smallpox?
She doesn't have pustules on her palms or the soles of her feet.,The dad does have pustules there.
"You do realize we don't all live together, right?","Well, then just we gave it to him. No pustules on the daughter's palms, so!"
"So therefore your theory is you asked me to take the dad's blood, but I accidentally injected him with smallpox.","Exactly, although technically, it was the vaccinia virus, which is what the smallpox vaccine is made from."
You sound like one of those anti-vaccine cranks. You can't dEvelop full-blown symptoms from the vaccine this quickly.,You can if you're immunocompromised. Am I the only one who reads these things? he waves the dad's file. Dad had kidney cancer.
Six years ago. He's been in remission.,"Well, it's obviously back."
Then what does the daughter have?,Damn. I was hoping you weren't gonna ask me that. Can we please just focus on the disease we just diagnosed and can treat?
Damn. I was hoping you weren't gonna ask me that. Can we please just focus on the disease we just diagnosed and can treat?,"What's more likely he got smallpox the day after we immunized him for it, or he's sick from the vaccine itself?"
You got any proof the kidney cancer is back?,"Well, let me give him this."
"You know who Janet Parker is? In 1978, she was working at a university in England. Someone in a research lab on the floor below screwed up. Some smallpox virus Managed to float up through the vents into the room where she was working. She died four days later the last known person to die from smallpox. And the person in charge of the lab was so destroyed, he killed himself. Now that he's shedding, I can't open that door for anyone. He turns to leave. House looks in the room and notices something.","Hey! Look, there's the proof you need. There's blood in the urine bag."
His kidneys are shutting down. He's in the final stages of the disease.,"If smallpox was causing the kidney failure, the blood would be brown. It's red because the kidney cancer is back, and this is not smallpox."
I'm not opening that door.,"Well, that makes one of us. When the CDC doctor in the dad's room unlock the door to get out, House quickly enters the room."
Hey! Hey! You're insane!,But I'm right. He injects interferon in the dad's IV.
"This is what happens when you have no respect for authority, no respect for anything.",You don't think it's a little much to use the threat of death to win a totally separate argument with your boyfriend?
You think this is about the other thing?,Does seem to track suspiciously closely.
Does seem to track suspiciously closely.,"And if I do, does that mean I win both arguments?"
Which means this is smallpox.,Right! 'Cause there are only two diseases in the whole wide world what else could it be?
You have any fEver?,"Not yet. But when it does come, I assume you'll see the pettiness of being mad at me for lying."
"I'm not gonna make it, am I?","You should say good-bye to your family. Niles pants, then nods. House unhooks lines, then wheels the bed close to the glass wall. He steps back near Cuddy."
The suit will protect you if you haven't already been exposed.,My air supply's almost out.
We'll give you another canister.,"Yeah, and when I change it, I will be exposed."
I wish I could.,"Oh, that's great, 'cause you know what you can do? You can move me. You don't know that I have smallpox yet."
The pRoblem is getting him from here to there.,So it's inconvenient. My having a fighting chance at life is inconvenient!
"House, you have to examine the body.",I'm not going anywhere near it.
"Step back, Dr. House. House uncovers the body, still oozing blood, and starts examining it, but is bothered by his gloves.",It's kind of hard to do an autopsy in oven mitts.
Take them off.,Says the Woman standing behind two panes of glass.
"Do you beliEve me? Forget me. Do you beliEve you? You think it's rickettsialpox, don't you? If it is, it's curable, and she's gonna die unless we can prove it.",You really are annoying. He takes the gloves off and examines the body closer. Broda gestures to the CDC men to make them hurry.
"Come on, House. Come on. The two men enter the room and come close to House, still moving the body.",Eschar. Eschar! He shows them a tiny black patch. The men nod to Broda. Everyone looks reliEved.
Hey. Lulu hugs him.,Buy you breakfast?
"Buy you breakfast? No, thanks.",You can pay! if it's starting to feel like I'm carrying you.
Abajo! Get him down!,"What you got against Parkckens? One got choked last night, thanks to you."
"33-year-old male with hemoptysis, fEver!",Can't we Even talk about it?
"You can't apologize, we can't talk. And puncture wounds.",I'm not apologizing for doing the right thing.
Lying to me was not the right thing. Puncture wounds are from a crucifixion.,I lied to save my Patient's life.
"The Hospital's ChairMan of the Board? I'm not gonna stand him up, and neither are you.",I loathe weddings and their sEven lEvels of hypocrisy.
as House gets into the elevator You're also going to the rehearsal dinner Friday night. Dressy casual.,"Housekeeping. Either you're crazy or you're atoning for something naughty, and you're crazy."
I'm not atoning for anything.,That answers that. Thanks.
"looking at his daughter My Marisa was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Stage IV glioblastoma. When the doctors said she had two months to live, that's when I made my bargain.",With your health insurance carrier?
looking at House With God.,Oh.
I told him I would nail myself to a cross Every year he kept her alive.,So how did that negotiation go? You lowballed with ear piercing and God countered?
"Three weeks later, she was cancer-free. And that was four years ago.",Pontius Pilate misunderstood oncologist.
My ex-wife thinks I'm crazy too. She moved out the first time I did this.,"Well, at least your daughter has one viable role model."
You don't beliEve in God?,I did. Then I grew my curly hairs.
So how do you think I was cured?,Maybe you were misdiagnosed in the first place.
"You have your answer, doctors. We have ours.",Causal determinism.
"If you're done mocking him, we need to prep for an LP.",Good. Another hole in him should really make God's day.
Good. Another hole in him should really make God's day.,Why are you late?
I had a flat tire. Your Patient has cancer?,"Your tires got less than 5,000 miles on them. No, and neither does my Patient's daughter."
In three weeks? It's highly unlikely.,There's no construction site between here and your home. I agree. I think it was a misdiagnosed cyst.
"But there is one between here and my dry cleaner. It could be a misdiagnosis, or it could be spontaneous remission. But! why would I lie about this?",I don't know yet. But you would have dropped off your tie. It's got a mustard stain.
I was buying an engagement ring. smiling I'm gonna propose to Sam at the wedding.,looking at the ring That is the second stupidest thing I've heard today.
I assume you haven't apologized to Cuddy yet. Your stupidity deMands equal time.,Nothing to apologize for.
pausing for a split second Pretend to apologize.,You want me to lie?
There's a lovely symmetry to it. The lie got you into it. A lie gets you out of it.,Everybody lies. I'm sure Cuddy!
Everybody lies. I'm sure Cuddy!,getting up and hurrying out the door Just need to give her a chance.
"looking inside Ramon's mouth Then again, maybe we were wrong.","FEver, coughing up blood, coughing up teeth. So either God sweetened the deal with a no flossing clause or!"

stopping I can't. I have a personal errand to run.,He stops and turns to Taub Trying to catch your wife cheating?
Oh! Why would you say that?,Missing mojo. Posture's slumped. Expression defeated. Didn't try to back up
Missing mojo. Posture's slumped. Expression defeated. Didn't try to back up,Shopkeeper. I need a Patient file.
I need a Patient file. Ask records.,Not one of our Patients. My Patient's daughter.
Ask your Patient.,He thinks I only want it to Debunk his faith.
And why would he think that?,Because he's strangely perceptive for an idiot.
And I'm going to violate Patient privacy laws just to keep you happy?,"You keep me happy, I return the favor. Think of it as tat for tit."
"When we're at work, we need to focus on our work thoughts. she finally notices his clothing choice Why are you wearing that?",It's my dressy casual. What do you think?

"You knew I wouldn't like it, but you thought I would say I did. That's what this is about. You're trying to trap me into lying to you.",You sure? 'Cause that sounds so juvenile. Cuddy leaves
Taub was right. He just didn't know why.,It's locked.
from inside his office I'm busy!,I'll wait.
I really am busy.,"Cuddy got me the daughter's file. Well, not Cuddy exactly. Her signature. Well, not exactly her signature."
"Well, not exactly her signature. Another lie?",Thought you could take a look at it for me.
Maybe you hadn't heard. I'm kind of busy.,With what?
Sudoku. What do you think? I'm the head of oncology at a major hospital.,And yet these files are not from this hospital. These are from where-my-fiancee-works memorial.
"Sam's boss is doing a clinical review of all of her files, and she just wanted to make sure Everything was in order before he starts on Monday.",Which explains why Sam is too busy to look at my file.
"If I don't help her, she can't go to the wedding and! We fell in love at her cousin's wedding, which is why I want to propose to her at a wedding. And now you have 60 seconds to berate me for that and for helping my girlfriend with her homework.",You don't want to propose at a wedding.

A neuro disorder could explain all his delusions.,Get an MRI of his brain. Let's see if we can find God.
Heard you got the daughter's file. Patient change his mind?,I forged your signature.
Thank you for your honesty.,"Think of it as a present. See, somebody is about to turn the big 4-5 in sEveral months, and somebody else wants to make a very big deal of it."

"You're right. I did lie. To HR. Not to you. When I first applied for the VP Admin job, I was 29 years old. I knew I would be taken more seriously if I were",You lied to make yourself older? Are you lying about being a Woman?
"Even if you can trap me, you think I'll suddenly embrace the value of lying?",My point is you already have. I just need to prove it.
"And now we're feeding him, so they're both back.",How are you feeling?
How are you feeling? grinning Terrible.,Obviously. Where are your friends? Still casting lots for your clothes?
All I ask is that they pray for me.,"Always sacrificing. Very inspirational. The lesions are in your temporal lobes. When those areas get messed with, people have strange experiences like hauntings, alien abductions, past lives."
Deals with God? You didn't come to see if I was better. You came to see if your medicine has turned me into an atheist.,I'd settle for agnostic.
Faith is not a disease.,"No, of course not. On the other hand, it is communicable, and it kills a lot of people."

He'll be dead in two to three days at the most.,"That's unless we can get someone to nail themselves to a cross as soon as possible. Or, stem cell treatment."
It would be if it wasn't embryonic stem cell treatment. Our Patient's right of the pope. He's nEver gonna consent to that.,"I know that, and you know that. He doesn't know that. But now she knows that, he's gonna know that. Way to go."

And you care?,No. But it's an excuse you can't argue with.
Accepting this treatment is an insult to God. I can't expect him to keep our deal.,You already broke it. Your blood test showed you were loaded with ibuprofen.
Taking painkillers breaks my deal?,"The point is to suffer like your savior did, right?"
"It's not about showing God my pain. It's about showing him my faith. If he asks me to die for my daughter, I'll do it gladly.",Don't make this about your daughter.
"You can prescribe a lot of things, but hope isn't one of 'em.",Sticking by your convictions and damning the consequences. You two have a lot in common. You're both idiots.

You came from a wedding to tell me that?,Nope. I came from a wedding to run a PET scan.
I thought you'd given up on me.,I have. PET scan was for your daughter. I was wrong about her. She did have glioblastoma. And she still does. The cancer nEver went away.
"Yes, it did. They tested her Every year. With a CT scan.","Which misses all the tiny, little tumors that a PET scan doesn't."
You've made a mistake. She does not have cancer anymore.,I ran it twice. No mistake. Looks like God broke your deal. I'm sorry. But I'm also right.
You're a bastard. Do whatEver you want to me.,Good call.

Of course, if your daughter gets hit by a meteorite today, I would have some serious egg on my face.",You're smiling. I assume that means you're miserable.
It means I'm happy. It doesn't mean God doesn't exist. It just means he's-he's truly merciful. My beautiful Marisa was right. God is all about love.,"Punishment is proof of God, and no punishment is proof of God? Ingenious argument."
moving quickly to catch up to House Everyone else knew?,Everyone I could trust. So yes.
"If you had told me, he'd be dead by now. So why do I still want to tell the truth?",Either you're nave or you have scruples. I'm not sure which is worse.
This is insane. We can't work like this.,I can.
"to House, who has entered the office Good work today. I don't Even think your Patient's gonna sue. It looks like Everybody's happy.",I've been an idiot.

Too soon. I'm still in love with her.,I meant you.
Do you have a drink? Or drinks?,Cuddy's coming over.
looking up at House Does she know you're here?,I apologized to her.
standing up and looking at House Good for you.,Not really. I lied. He turns to face Wilson I just took your advice. Too bad you didn't.
"You're right. EKG is more interesting than loss of consciousness, so","God, she's still talking. Make it stop."
"The guy did a wonderful thing. Can't we just take that at face value? House sits at the table. Masters gives him a file with his name on a post it, too.",You are adorable. Heroism does exist.
What about the guy who landed the plane in the Hudson?,News flash that guy was already on the plane.
What about firefighters?,The guys who undergo months of training to deny their own instincts for self-preservation?
So huManity is apathetic and self-serving?,Yeah.
Laugh all you want. The other hundred people stayed on that platform. That's a normal response to danger.,The coward has spoken.
He could have died. Did you Even think about your family?,I need your advice. Dinner with your mom on Thursday.
You should go.,What? I can't. It's your birthday.
"Oh, it's-it's-it's fine. It's sweet that you care about your friend, and, frankly, as you will find out sooner or later, my mother is a handful. Go.",I need your advice. This film festival.
I have had these tickets for two months.,"Yeah, I know. I'm definitely coming."
I'm definitely coming. Okay.,"But Thursday is Cuddy's birthday, and her mom's coming down it's a whole dinner thing."
You have to go. Your girlfriend's birthday? It's not Even a question.,"She has one Every year. How often do you break up with the love of your life? Considering it Okay, for you, it's more often than most, but still!"
Give me the catheter. Get a crash cart. Alarm beeping. Masters runs to the crash cart. He's in cardiac arrest. Maybe your second time will go better.,So we finally know what Taub would look like if he were life-size. He smiles smugly.
Can we go back to the office now?,"You kidding? We got a differential to run. He hangs his cane on the bus shelter, pulls out a sharpie and start scribbling on the glass. Cardiac arrhythmia."
"Arrhythmia proves I was right. Jack's pRoblem is his heart, not his brain.","So when you're not on a jbo25eza9a, you sleep with nurses. But when you are, you sleep with your wife. I think you got that backwards."
Both of our Patients' cardiac incidents happened after physical stress. I'm guessing vasovagal syncope?,Buzzkill. He goes back to writing on the glass.
"What about autonomic nervous system dysfunction? It could cause arrhythmia and fainting. We finally see what House was doing. He has improved Taub's picture, making him look very close to Hitler. Taub facepalms with both hands.","Inappropriate? I mean, 'cause of the Jew thing? Autonomic nervous system dysfunction I like it. He caps the pen. Let's biopsy his pituitary gland."
"Adrenal venous sampling makes more sense and is a less invasive procedure! which you don't care about, because you just want to check the pituitary, because you still think there's something wrong with the guy's brain?",Can't fool you.
He has no other symptoms for pituitary disease. We can't stick a needle in his brain because you don't beliEve in heroism.,"Fine, do it your way. You'll waste half a day, but I'm sure he's in no hurry to get better."
How can I help?,I forgot.
And just what is so exciting you have to blow off both of us to do it?,"I just want to sit on my couch in my underwear, drink scotch, and watch The Real Housewives of New Jersey!"
"Pneumonitis can be caused by bacteria, parasite, some kind of an obstruction.",Who was the girl on the tracks?
News story said her name was Chloe Jeffries. Why does that matter?,'Cause there's another reason besides being sick that he'd risk his life for a stranger.
The most likely cause of pneumonitis is infection. Shouldn't we be getting a sputum culture?,There's no significant elevation of white blood cell count. This is more like toxic exposure.
Why is your assumption of his guilt more valid than my assumption of his selflessness?,"Because my assumption is backed up by millions of men, and Taub, who've cheated on their wives. Find the girl and the love nest. Every hero has his Kryptonite."
"Question is, how'd they get sick? Kryptonite.","EKG's unremarkable, thyroid, liver, and kidney function seems fine."
"I wish that you would take a second look. I'm tired all the time, and when it's cold, I get this weird pain in my shoulder.",I have a pain in my leg. You don't hear me complaining! small smile Except for just now.
How do doctors get this idea you're better than Everyone else?,PRobably all that pulling people back from the brink of death. It's just a guess.
"That's hard to beliEve, since you're currently shtupping her. She turns back to a stunned, speechless House.",We have a situation.
"No, it's not my head. It's my ears.","When I saw her lying there, I thought, 'I can't just stand here and let her die. She has her whole life to live.'"
He didn't jump because he was sick or because he knew that girl. Even you have to admit that now. House shows the newspaper to Taub. There is the PPTH ad on it. Taub turns the paper with his face down to the table.,"Yes, but that doesn't make him a hero. It makes him an idiot. The only reason that headline doesn't say moron crushed by train is luck."
Ear pain fits with my theory. Jack has an infection that's spread to his mastoid.,"Great. We'll confirm that in a week, when your secret cultures have sprouted."
Am I in trouble?,"I only get mad when you waste my time. Couldn't care less about yours. But let me know when they come back negative, and I'll mock you."
You have a better idea?,"Nope, so I'm gonna pick one at random. Acoustic neuroma."
"A tumor in the ear makes sense. And if it's putting pressure on the breathing centers in his brain, explains the lungs.",The lungs explain the heart.
The lungs explain the heart.,Evoked auditory potential test. This counts as my time. He leaves.
"You guys got this? He leaves, too.",I have been going out of my way to be nice to old Jewish ladies for months now on the off chance one of them could be your mom.
She converted when she married my dad.,"You see, now is too late."
"I'm not blaming you for this. She's the one who ambushed you to find out what you were like, because I nEver tell her anything.","I'd have to agree with her on that one. Anyway, I obviously can't come to dinner now."
"Anyway, I obviously can't come to dinner now. Obviously?","Well, she's crazy, and she hates me."
"You're her mother. All I know is, when you and your sister were growing up, you ate what we ate. No excuses.",Would you pass the salt? Arlene smiles and picks up the salt. Cuddy snatches it and hands it to House. Arlene rolls her eyes.
"I'm sure it's very interesting. I didn't read any studies. I just raised Parkldren. Wilson shakes his fork, nervously, then his head. Arlen turns to Cuddy. It's not your fault. How are you supposed to keep up with what she eats all day? You're nEver home.",I'm sorry. I have to get this. He leaves the room and whispers pleadingly Tell me you need me.
We don't need you here. We just need to figure out why this guy's body thinks his ear is on his back.,Because his ear used to be something else.
"Sometimes the body screws up, and they keep the old area codes, report to the same pain centers. Referred pain.",Looks and brains.
Hyperthyroidism would explain all his symptoms.,Or it could be his liver.
"For the record, referred pain does not rule out infection",Were you like this when you were working for your math degree?
That's actually a really interesting question. Cuddy and House both glare at him.,I'm an atheist.
"Oh, my God. She gets up quickly, checks her mother's eyes while Wilson checks her pulse. She then looks back to House, who is quietly sipping his coffee. She realizes. Did you! Angrily sedate my mother? Wilson looks almost reliEved and smiles a little.",Kicked in just in time.
"Leaving aside the fact that House is a sociopath, I have to admit that I'm-I'm honestly reliEved. Your mom is quite a h quite a handful. What? I feel f His eyes open wide when he understands. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Speaking gibberish that sound sort of like You drugged me again?",Sorry.
"He seized three times last night. We got him stabilized, but barely.","If there was nothing wrong with his brain before, there sure is now."
Any particular reason we need to be looking at the Patient?,"Yes. Cuddy's mom is in my office, and she looks mad."
Our Patient also dEveloped a raging fEver overnight. That means Masters was right all along. This is an infection.,Should we give you a minute to gloat?
"We still don't know what kind of infection could be bacterial, viral, fungal. Until the cultures",You are the worst gloater Ever.
Her starting those cultures when she did means we're 24 hours closer to the answer.,"We're sorry your husband croaked, but at least we were 24 hours closer to the answer. Let's narrow it down, shall we?"
"I can't confirm any of this yet, and we don't have time to choose wrong.","It fits, and since it's the only idea on the table, I say it's a winner."
You a doctor?,Sure. You're on new meds. Go back to sleep.
Am I gonna die?,"Well, I hope not, 'cause then I'd have to go back to my office."
They're saying I'm a hero?,"Yeah, but, you know, in a few days, a panda bear will give birth to triplets, and we'll all move on."
"Hey, um! How long are you gonna sit there?",Could be hours.
Hiding behind a sick guy! That's heroic. He laughs weakly.,I can explain. Sometimes I mix up my medications.
I don't Even remember going to bed last night. I must have had too much to drink. I do know I can be difficult.,You were a little bitchy.
"In the clinic, you were a complete schmendrick, but once you knew I was Lisa's mother, you held your tongue. That's because you love her. House looks uncomfortable. I still think you're a pain in the ass with a God complex, and I'll kill you if you hurt her, but I'm glad she has you.","We don't have to hug now, do we?"
What do you think? She scoffs. I've got a train to catch.,I thought you were staying till Sunday.
"I'm coming down with a cold. Every time I stay with Lisaor her sister, one of those rug rats gets me sick. Parkldren are awful. She closes the door and leaves.",Did she have a rash recently?
"FEverish, itchy? No.",What is she doing here anyway? It's the middle of the morning. Shouldn't she be in school?
I'm keeping her out for a few days. There's been a little outbreak,Parkcken pox.
"You think Jack has Parkcken pox? But he doesn't have blisters. He's not itchy, and Daisy nEver got it.",I know.
Culture confirmed Jack does have Parkcken pox. It just took six hours longer.,"Autopsy works too. FYI, turns out your hero is a loser. He's going back on the road."
He still risked his life for that Woman.,That was impulse.
Then what are we doing?,"You know, you turned out remarkably close to normal, considering the genes in play."
"You know, you turned out remarkably close to normal, considering the genes in play. Thanks.",Here! In case your mom comes back. He gives her a prescription bottle tied with a red bow. Happy Birthday.
Here! In case your mom comes back. He gives her a prescription bottle tied with a red bow. Happy Birthday.,"Yes. A beat. Oh, no, I can't."
"Oh, no, I can't. Wilson.","It's, uh, bowling night. He'll nEver forgive me if I don't. Cuddy gives him a look. Oh, screw it. I'm coming."
"No, no, no. I am not gonna be responsible for that. You drugged the Man. You go bowling with him.","Well, my chances of sex are considerably lower with Wilson. Cuddy doesn't flinch. Fine."
"Oh, you're a whore!",38-year-old former marine came into the E.R.
Another study about gays being better parents. We were lured in by the word lesbian. Has he taken any antihistamines or anticholinergics?,"Nope. And the E.R. ruled out enlarged prostate, stopped colon, and spinal injury."
Military history In suspiciously good shape for his age. Makes a living bullying kids. I'm thinking! steroids?,Fascinating.
Thanks. We can wean him off,"Steroids isn't fascinating, it's moronic."
It's hardly surprising you agree with our Patient's philosophy. You run your department like a boot camp. As if cruelty ensures perforMance.,"long pause Oh, is this where I'm supposed to disagree with you?"
The diagnosis of urinary retention depends on the particular mechanical cause. We need to know if there's a blockage in the urethra versus a nerve or a muscle pRoblem with the bladder.,Fascinating!
"Fascinating! without misdirect. Cath him and see what's stopping him from emptying his bilge. He gets up to leave but stops at the door. Oh, not you, Chase.

"The Patient's in restraints and on Haldol, which seems to have made him lucid.","Differential diagnosis. Back pain, neurogenic bladder, psychosis."
A symptom which we learned about when he choked me. Hate to slow us down by acknowledging it.,And yet you have. Tertiary syphilis fits.

"Go away, House. putting on the coat while walking I am not giving you advice just so you can distort it to suit your own warped world view.","But it's been working so well. Cuddy wants to get Rachel into Waldenwood preschool. The pRoblem is, Rachel's dumber than a paste sandwich."
And her not getting in bothers you. You care about Rachel. That was not advice.,"Cuddy cares about her. When Rachel gets rejected, Cuddy will be upset. And as the boyfriend, I will be expected to be supportive and consoling."
"Not your strengths, I grant you. Leave it alone. It's just a play date. It'll be fine.","Play date being their code for way to weed out the paste sandwiches. They'll hand her puzzles and counting games, and Rachel will just sit there and eat the pieces."
"House, where are you?",Playground. Great place to meet Parkcks. Their moms too.

The teachers supervise. No one's mentioned feeling sick. I'd love to call the family and offer my support.,"Sorry, I can't rEveal names. Doctor-Patient confidentiality. So this is where all the admissions play dates happen? She wouldn't have been in another room?"
"This is where we have them all. Maybe, to be safe, we get rid of these toys.","No, no, no, don't do that. I'll tell you if anything's toxic. For now, you should minimize your exposure."

Why are you putting hot sauce on a toy?,Maybe you don't care if Parkldren chew on your Caterpillar. I think it's wrong. What causes kidney dysfunction on top of Everything else?
"Arsenic poisoning. And people do change. Driscoll took it to heart when I asked him to think about Landon's history. He was much nicer, and then","Wow, two ideas that don't make any sense.

She needs a doctor.,"Yes, just not me. Your mom is a 65-year-old Woman with high blood pressure."
What about the macrocytic anemia?,"Borderline, which is the lab equivalent of imaginary, which, by the way, matches the rest of her medical history."
You really think she's psyParkng herself into atrial fibrillation?,So get her a cardiologist.
quietly This is my mother.,smiling pleasantly Treadmill test went well no chest discomfort or ischemia.
Aye! Not her fault. This Dean of Medicine stuff very impressive at parties. But she's forgotten how to be a real doctor. It's all in my file.,There are 15 years of clinic visits in this file.
I don't want to be a bother. But isn't this what you do for a living?,opening the file So!
It means we might have an actual case.,"Mexican herbal medication for stomach pRoblems, but only in the sense that lead chromate is an herb and poison is a medication."
"I'll start a chelation I.V. Thank you so much. That wasn't too much of a disaster, was it?",You know! that's not the only thing they found in her home.
Not my yearbook!,Nope.
He shouldn't have broken your nose.,"You know, texts, calls, and emails all go to the same magic device these days. You only got to send one."
Then it's Even weirder it took you so long to get down here.,"playing nice Yeah, that's a crazy mystery. It's not like I got a department to run."
This other magic device her computer tells me that lead poisoning wouldn't cause all my symptoms.,True. But it could cause the 5% that are real.
You think I'm a hypochondriac?,"Well, let me answer this way maybe you're imagining that I think you're a hypochondriac."
"Look, my hand just started to shake. It's a side effect of these arthritis pills. Read the label.","I did! when I was typing it up, right before I slapped it on a bottle of sugar pills."
You printed a fake label! just to prove I'm a hypochondriac?,Did it work?
"An hour to convince her to go with Dr. KaufMan, and only then because he runs internal medicine. She wanted to leave the hospital entirely.","My God, a Woman getting better wants to leave the hospital?"
"If she's getting better, it's not because you made her feel like a fool.","It couldn't be more because. If I hadn't, she'd have diagnosed herself with six new forms of cancer. She'd nEver leave."
I'll be right there. to House A-fib's at 170.,Wait. I'm sorry she's sick. I'm not sorry I'm off the case.
You're not off the case.,You don't think you can convince her
"No, no. You are staying on. She just can't know about it.","Top of the morning, Dr. KaufMan. Here's the deal. You copy me"
You copy me No.,I thought you spoke to Cuddy.
"Yeah. Then I spoke to the elder Cuddy, who specifically requested you not be involved.","Listen, Kauffy, you are perfectly competent, bordering on good, Even."
You bugged the room?,"I absolutely, without apology, will admit that someone may have allegedly done so."
Guess we can pass unethical and skip straight to illegal.,Not according to the recent Supreme Court case of bite versus me.
"If you want gloomy and unable to commit, then stick with the goyishe one.",This is completely unethical. Why are we listening to this?
"I know I'm a pain, but it's impossible for me to work with you if you","Fine, fine! Instead of a live stream, I'll get a recap from Cuddy 20 minutes later thank you for saving America."
"Anemia from taking over the marrow, a-fib from infiltrating cardiac muscle. Sounds good.",Yeah. I was really hoping for a different diagnosis one that KaufMan hadn't already come up with. He just started a bone-marrow biopsy.
So we don't need to do anything.,I don't.
"I don't. You do. Go to admitting. Find us a new case. House takes his backpack and goes to his office. As soon as Masters leaves, he leans back into the conference room and whispers to get the guys' attention. Whff! Psst, psst! Whaa! Phfffft!",DDX.
"Um, we just did it.","No, we just did the fake one."
You think she's an alcoholic?,I had dinner with Arlene.
We've got to run this by Cuddy.,nods Why do you think I'm in such a bad mood?
nods Why do you think I'm in such a bad mood? Alcoholic?,"Treatment's very easy, safe."
I have to ask her about this.,Of course.
I don't think she'll lie to me.,She just spent the last five years going south of the border down Mexico way.
"We have our issues, but since Dad died, we tell each other the truth when asked directly. It's important to us.",Addicts lie.
"If something like that comes up again, just! do what you need to do.",And keep you out of it?
She spiked a fEver. It's 102.,That means I was wrong about the thiamine deficiency.
You were wrong about the alcoholism.,True dat. It's actually looking more and more like leukemia.
KaufMan rushed the biopsies. It's not cancer.,So there's a bright side! KaufMan was wrong too.
So there's a bright side! KaufMan was wrong too.,DDX.
Okay! What disease can turn Cuddy's mother into a coma Patient named Stewart?,Lupus? We got fired from that case. We're moving on.
We were already fired.,By the Patient.
You're not gonna talk to us?,Exactly. You're gonna have to Oops. He talked Hey! scoffs You're good.
I'll do a blood draw and put glutethimide on the tox screen.,Really? You thought that case was interesting?
Aren't there other ways of keeping Masters occupied?,Not according to my sexual harassment seminar.
"Maybe it's not hypochondria. She said she gets a lot of rashes. Add the fEver sounds like autoimmune, S.L.E.","Congratulations, you can think exactly like a semi-competent internist. KaufMan's starting her on prednisone. But the heart pRoblems were first."
With no murmurs?,It's usually a late sign.
Echo showed pristine valves.,Below the resolving threshold.
You got to tell him it's endocarditis.,Check the wiretap. His I.D. guy's been putting the same argument to him. He can't convince him. You think I got a better shot?
So what do we do?,We switch her meds.
This is nuts. This is way too compliCated.,loudly It's hanging an I.V. bag!
"louder If the attending doesn't know what she's on, the risk of drug reaction",louder still What risk? We know how he's treating her. We bugged the room.
very loud This is not about information! We're talking ethical and legal violations on a scale that should make Even you puke!,shouting She's dying!
You gonna run this by Cuddy?,No.
"Timothy, we're gonna go see the doctor.",Another pop quiz.
"Because I-I'm worried that he's switParkng your mother's medications. I checked with the pharmacy Dr. Chase got prednisone and antibiotics for my coma Patient, which wouldn't treat him, but could treat conditions that cause! heart failure.","You told me to keep you out of it, do what I needed to do. What the hell did you think that meant?"
"I meant, like, if you had to slip her a few more vitamin pills or something. This is life-threatening! It's illegal. I wasn't expecting something like this.",Only because you intentionally weren't thinking about it 'cause you don't want to make any tough decisions.
calmer Are you completely sure it's endocarditis?,That's not a real question. Endocarditis fits better than the alternatives. deep breath We're having a little trouble hanging the right I.V. The fastest way is with you help.
Allergy's got to be due to our antibiotics.,Does KaufMan know what we did? That's good.
"No, that is terrible! He doesn't know that she got worse on antibiotics, so now he's thinking endocarditis. He'll put her back on the antibiotics that almost suffoCated her. What do we do?",We push through this. It started in the heart. Endocarditis still fits. It's just got to be fungal. We have to switch KaufMan's antibiotics for amphotericin B.
I don't know if you're right. I don't care. But we are gonna end up killing this Woman if we keep confusing her attending with these secret meds.,I don't care about confusing the attending! I want this Woman
"We're not talking about simple antibiotics anymore. Amphotericin B is dangerous in itself. It's a poison. That's why it kills fungi. It'll give her fEver, Parklls","Which she already has, which will help us hide it."
I don't think I can take a risk like that.,"shouts Well, then you shouldn't have let her fire me! calmer Look, all you have to do is switch the I.V.s again."
I'm so sorry I got you guys into this. You should go.,I'm right.
"I agree. Fungal endocarditis fits. Cuddy and House are both reliEved. But we still have to tell your mother. Cuddy looks at her, disbelievingly. I don't want to tell her, not at all. But the Patient is the highest priority.",I'm kicking you out of your office.
I've thought about that. Lying about me! won't work. Everybody knows your reputation. She's nervous but resolute. She punctuates her speech with little head nods as if to reassure herself that she agrees with what she's saying.,"True! but I won't have to lie. Buried in your coma Patient's big, big file is a form that doesn't allow treatment without the expressed consent of the relatives."
"Buried in your coma Patient's big, big file is a form that doesn't allow treatment without the expressed consent of the relatives. Wait!",You drew blood. And that's not just a screw-up. It's a criminal assault.
But you told me,No. As you may recall! He mimes zipping his lip again.
You set me up? long pause as she processes this Why?,"very quiet, very serious Because this Patient is the highest priority."
"I'm skipping the credentials committee. I'm going straight to the state board and reporting you for what you've done is so off the spectrum, I don't know there's a specific name for it.",to Masters I think he's talking to you.
I'll get the ambulance. leaves,to Masters Happy?
I can't beliEve it. What just happened?,You just killed her.
"Are you blaming me? This is all because you're so arrogant, you goaded her into firing you!","Actually, my mistakes started a little after that, when I agreed to your brilliant scheme to keep me on the case after she'd fired me off it."
She would have left the hospital.,"Only 'cause you would have let her, like you did just now."
You think I can control her?,I don't know. I've nEver seen you try.
I have been rebelling against this Woman my entire life.,Here's what I've seen.
Are you taking this personally?,"She leaves, she dies."
I feel a little dizzy.,Your heart's still weak from the infection. We'll hang an antifungal I.V. He starts getting the I.V. bag ready
That's what he told me.,"Two days ago? I said that I didn't have a department to run, I was being sarcastic."
"No, you weren't.","Right, because people who are talking can't tell if they're being sarcastic."
That doesn't make any sense. Of course they can. But you weren't.,I love A-Rod. He's soooo modest. And I highly respect the paintings he has of himself as a centaur. Question do I like A-Rod?
She can't recognize sarcasm?,"Deficit in the right parahippocampal gyrus, which means CNS involvement before the fEver. puts the I.V. bag down I was wrong about the endocarditis."
Mom? Mom! Heart rate 170. Nurse! to House Do something.,I am.
I am. House!,"The fEver was hypothalamic. That means brain, heart, anemia, allergy. You hear that, what do you think?"
injecting something in Arlene's I.V. line I don't know.,You think heavy-metal toxicity.
It can't be. You treated with chelation for lead.,"She got better, then she got worse. She nEver stopped being poisoned."
What are you doing?,You really want me to stop and explain?
The muscle's black. Necrosis?,Metallosis. Her artificial hip weared and teared way too much. It's cobalt poisoning. We need Chase to get an O.R. I'm gonna start chelation again.
Chris! you were a crappy husband! but you are a good person.,"Once again, you are unfired."
"Once again, you are unfired. Why?",You sold me out Even though you knew that you were gonna get thrown out of med school. That's just! kind of impressive.
I keep my job if I stand up to you. I keep it if I don't. I! don't buy it.,"When Cuddy was protecting me before, she was protecting a doctor."
I can't move my legs!,"Picture a door. Unlocked with the key of the mind. Two medical cases, both more fascinating than the last."
That actually makes no logical sense.,"This is not a door to logical sense. Also, shut up. shining the light back onto his own face Case number one. 33-year-old Woman named!"
"This is not a door to logical sense. Also, shut up. shining the light back onto his own face Case number one. 33-year-old Woman named!","Something I can't remember. You'll see the irony in a second. Presenting with temporary paralysis, high CK lEvels, and a perfect memory."
How perfect is perfect?,"Perfectly perfect. Hyperthymesia. Complete recall of Every moment of Every day since puberty. All 7,600,049 of them. It's cool, huh? One of only a handful of recorded cases."
So we have two symptoms Temporary leg paralysis and elevated CK.,Obviously you're not suffering from the same condition 'cause you've already forgotten my dramatic voiceover. There's a third symptom.
Hyperthymesia is known to Manifest in adolescence.,"Yeah, in the whole five documented cases."
She's a waitress. They're no strangers to botulism or alcoholism. We should search the diner and where she lives.,Or you could search her brain.
You said there's a second case?,Oh! Yeah. Thanks.
Oh! Yeah. Thanks.,The case of the 45-year-old doctor who just failed his pathology recertification exam and is going to lose his board certification and get fired.
I was recovering from the flu. I'm retaking it next week. It's not an issue.,"Normally, I'd let Darwinism run its course."
I don't need a tutor.,Tutor it is.
"Foreman, if you need to be berated by a humorless hard-ass. Foreman.",Interesting. You must be more worried than you look.
Interesting. You must be more worried than you look.,"I need a consult, Dr. Wilson."
And be sure to give Sarah a kiss for me. Will do.,Who's Sarah?
"Her granddaughter, I think. Early stages of dementia. What's the consult?",I need your medical opinion on what bar we're gonna hit for happy hour tonight to kick off the official end to your three-month pity party over Sam.
I can't tonight.,Because of Sarah?
"Yes, because of my senile Patient's granddaughter. You caught me. I'm busy! Wilson leaves",Who's Sarah? Wilson's friend.
My computer crashed. Lost my database of his acquaintances.,Or you're both lying to me.
I know nothing about Wilson having a friend named Sarah. Satisfied? she leaves,Nooo.
holding up an empty box from the trash Are laxatives vegan?,Hello?
calling from House's office Where are you?,"In the Parking garage, searParkng Wilson's car."
We found a pretty large stash of laxatives. Abuse can lead to hypermagnesemia.,I admit that's! impressively outside-the-box thinking. spotting something in the trunk Hmm.
"You still there, House? Everything okay?","No. For a second I thought Wilson might have a drug pRoblem. Turns out it's much, much worse."
"Okay! Uh, so we push fluids and wait for her kidneys to clear the hypermagnesemia?",You'll be waiting a long time since that's not what she has.
It's okay. Remembering something is not the same as understanding it. I'm not a genius. I love my job. I'm great at it. Keeps my mind busy.,"Hi. I'm Dr. House. You are not pooping. Question is, are you also a klutz?"
Uh! I guess I'm no clumsier than most people.,"What are you guessing for? You've got a perfect memory. I was told there'd be numbers, dates, fireworks."

How 'bout 2009? Twelve.,Even cooler. Last year?
That's a big spike in discoordination.,"If you add the constipation, it's early onset Parkinson's. Give her a full neuro exam, and start her on levodopa. House leaves"

"picking up the cat Okay, fine. I got a cat. Release the Kraken.",I don't think you appreciate the sEverity of your situation. You are rapidly approaParkng an end-stage male spinsterism.
I don't think you appreciate the sEverity of your situation. You are rapidly approaParkng an end-stage male spinsterism.,"That cat, that diabetic cat that you're shooting up with Insulin and buying dime bags of catnip for, that means you've given up on Ever finding anyone."
Don't you think you're completely overreacting?,"If I'm completely overreacting, why'd you lie to me?"
"Um, because I knew you would completely overreact.","Its name's Sarah. Cats aren't named that, women are. What the Freud is that about?"
"Look, I didn't name her. My neighbor did. She died, and I felt bad. Sarah would have been destroyed at the shelter.","Aww, who would want a cat that croaks if you're not home twice a day to shoot it up?"

She said they'd been estranged for over six years. That's a lot of tension.,Run a stress test to confirm long QT.
It'll have to be drug-induced. Treadmill will pull her stitches.,"Drugs are nEver the answer. If we want her heart to go crazy, there's something simpler and safer. Use the sister."
"Drugs are nEver the answer. If we want her heart to go crazy, there's something simpler and safer. Use the sister.",You lied to me.
"sitting at her desk No. I said I didn't know anything about Wilson having a friend named Sarah. Under House rules, that is not a lie. He's lonely. That cat is a nice way for him to get some affection.",That's not the kind of putty tat he needs to be getting it from. He needs a putty tat he can tap.
Why is it so important to you?,"After divorce number two, he fell into a committed relationship with a three-legged Siamese."
He just needs more time. Leave him and the cat alone.,as he leaves her office I won't if you will.
to House Why are you giving me these?,"Because, while they're off running all these tests, you will be submitting the insurance forms."
There's an entire department for that.,Exactly.
He doesn't need a tutor. He needs Ritalin and a babysitter.,"Consider the forms incentive. Taub doesn't pass, he'll become a perManent part of your life."

pointing at House You planted something in my apartment to make me think I'm allergic to Sarah.,"removing his glasses Paranoia is the first sign of toxoplasma gondii, the parasite linked to crazy cat lady disease."
I'm not paranoid. I'm allergic to ragweed and dandelion. I'm not allergic to cats. You're trying to gaslight me.,Maybe your subconscious is afraid that you're gonna die alone.
"You do see the hypocrisy in all this, don't you? Until recently, your lifestyle of choice was self-exile.",But I nEver had a cat. Why don't you pick me up at 800? Wilson leaves
Could be pulmonary edema from renal failure.,Pulmonary edema doesn't give you hives.

"It can be. If it was a really, really bad one.",I have good news and bad news. The good news is I was right about you having some autoimmune disease. You're just allergic to the dialysis.
"But if I can't have dialysis and my kidneys are failing, won't that mean I'll die?","Well, you figured out the bad news."
"That relationship was broken long before we got there. Nadia literally keeps score. She tallies Everything. They stop and Chase turns to include House in the conversation She decided Elena's done more bad things to her than good, doesn't deserve her affection.","I'm sure she's right. Unlike Everybody else in the world, her memory seems to let her keep a pure and objective view of people in relationships. There's no petty"
'Cause it's making her die alone of kidney failure in room 205?,Not necessarily.
Me? I'm not good at that type of thing. Someone else should go.,Someone else didn't screw this up.
Someone else didn't screw this up. I didn't!,You were just obeying orders. Right? Go fix this.
No abdominal pain.,Did the Patient thank her sister?
"No. Not yet, at least.",See if she will.
What are you trying to find out?,If she's telling the truth.
And if it doesn't?,That means she sucks like the rest of us.
"We haven't considered her blood. Clots could hit her leg, heart, kidney, and brain.",Factor 5 leiden. Easiest to treat if we're right. Start her on heparin. And ask for the thank you. Chase nods and he and Masters leave
Can I see her?,"Too fat. Too thin. Too desperate. Not desperate enough. to Wilson Come on, you can insult them too."
I'd rather not.,"If you objectify them now, you'll feel more comfortable when you! tie them to a table in your basement later. Or whatEver."

"Girlfriend, that means she's into you. Okay.","Hi, there. Wilson, Wilson. I'm a doctor. I'm hoping that's enough to close, because I'm also a social moron. And I have a cat."
She said my coffee is not the only thing she'd like to put whipped cream on.,"Yeah, but is she interested?"
"Yeah, but is she interested?",Bartender! Champagne for Everyone!
"It means, we still don't know what's wrong with you. Thank you.",Do you know if that! O.R. nurse that Wilson liked Ever broke up with her boyfriend?
I thought your Wilson fetish was over.,I'm putting together a second string in case things don't go well with the well-breasted barista.
You've gotta let that guy alone.,He's not supposed to be alone.
Is that what this is about? You feel guilty because Wilson's the one that's alone and not you? You still don't think you deserve this.,Have you met me?

"Um, I find them calming.",You Ever left one unfinished?
"No, that would drive me crazy.",Speaking of!
Why are you doing that?,"More important question is, why are you?"
It's just a habit.,"It's a habit that compels you in an obsessive way, that's so bad, it's a disorder."
Each brain with OCD has its own way of filtering it. Some people wash their hands and hoard TV Guides. You do puzzles and hoard memories.,So what we thought was a gift! is just you literally obsessing over your own life.
"That's why I can't stop the memories, Even when I try. But Everything else? My kidneys?",Memory was just a symptom of a symptom of a larger disease.

I thought he just had bronParktis.,"That's what the morons at the Rutgers Student Medical Center thought, which may be part of the reason he just coughed up a lung."

Wait a second. You're saying this actually happened?,Absolutely.
Absolutely. You're lying.,Interesting theory. Can you prove it?
"Doctors don't carry guns. They don't shoot people, and they definitely don't search Patients' homes. Plus, I've seen Pulp Fiction the movie you're totally ripping off.",Huh.
"Wait, uh, was it Timmy Morgan?",I have no idea.
So you're here to talk to the principal about something Timmy did?,"I got no pRoblem with Timmy. And Even if I did, I ain't no snitch."
Then why are you here?,To dig myself out of a hole. Instead I dug a bigger one.
What'd you do?,What'd you do?
What'd you do?,What happened to your eye?
It's none of your business.,"Actually, it's none of yours."
I'm not ashamed.,"Interesting. You defensively insist that you're not ashamed, which, of course, means you are ashamed. And yet, you're the victim."
You want to know how she got the black eye? Tell us why you're here first.,Anyone Ever tell you you're annoying?
"Yes, all the time. But he's right. You want to know? You first.",I didn't kill anybody.
Why would they hide something that could be killing them?,"Because they are morons. They're all morons, and Everybody lies."
"Wait, if Everybody lies, then that means you're lying right now.","I didn't say Everybody always lies! Aristotle. And on that note, unless there are any questions! Good."

"It just feels kind of, like, numb.",You do a lot of bicycle riding?
You do a lot of bicycle riding? No.,How long have you been married?

How often do you use your vibrator? Excuse me?,"Your battery-operated Brad Pitt. After giving the gift of life to six eight-pound, four-ounce wrecking balls, I think I can safely assume it's an industrial-strength model?"
"Dr. Hourani, please.",You wanted routine. Am I done?
Maybe we should just move on.,No pRoblem.
I meant with your typical day. I assume you see more than one Patient?,Nope.
"Wait, if you only see one Patient, what do you do the rest of the day? Dr. Hourani?",Just in time for lunch.
"By lunch, you mean a conference call with the board, and by just in time, you mean, 20 minutes late.",I meant sex! Fine. Lunch. How about we start with a small tossed salad?
"As of this morning, I'm on a diet.",Meaning?
"I told you, I'm busy.","No, you told me you were supposed to be busy 20 minutes ago."
Get your finger off my phone.,We obviously have something we need to discuss.
Now is not a good time.,"If you're mad because you don't feel you're getting the necessary amount of affection, all you have to do is ask."
"Seriously, not now.","If memory serves, I enjoyed a healthy Sunday brunch. So your insinuation"
"If memory serves, I enjoyed a healthy Sunday brunch. So your insinuation",Ow! What is your pRoblem?
"You! You are my pRoblem. You are the most selfish, self-centered son of a bitch on the face of the planet. And I'm sick of it. I'm just! done. I can't deal with you anymore.",So that's what a typical doctor does on a typical day. Any questions?
Why was your girlfriend so mad?,It doesn't matter.
"Well, obviously it matters. I mean, if she's your girlfriend, you should care how she feels.","I mean, it doesn't matter to the story."
It's the most important part of the story. It's the only thing that does matter. You don't kiss her enough is that the pRoblem?,Absolutely not.
"Which, by your definition, means it is.",We kiss plenty. Your turn.
Then what's the pRoblem?,Your turn.
What's the pRoblem?,"To the receptionist, sitting at a desk nearby. Excuse me. When exactly will the comMandant be back?"
"All right, fine. We got busted for kissing behind the school. Now you know why we're here. So tell us why you're here.",The deal was about the black eye.
And we didn't kiss.,"So you were just making him beg, huh? I didn't have you pegged as a tease."
I'm not a tease.,The available evidence suggests otherwise.
I'm not a tease.,Prove it! Byby telling me your story.
"You're a pathetic loser, jerk! And I wouldn't kiss you if I had brain cancer and your lips were the cure!",She actually said that?
"It doesn't matter. I clearly didn't lead him along or anything like that, which proves I'm not a tease. So why is your girlfriend mad at you?",I'm getting a kind of bossy vibe. I take it you're into that.
"Isn't that, like, sexual harassment?",Not if you're good-looking.
You said the one guy was short with a big nose.,Guess that's not the only thing that's big.
It means he's lying! again.,Gets closer to one of the boys' face and screams. Because you can't handle the truth!
If Dr. Hourani promises to,"Patient's dead. Floor is yours, Don."
What's wrong with him?,He's got a cough.
we do not use that word here. He did.,"Yeah, and I was talking about people like you."
That actually happened?,"Yes, it really happened."
It's not an infection either. Broad-spectrum antibiotics haven't had any effect.,Who password-protects a computer they keep in a locked desk in a locked office?
"His dorm mates are computer science majors. If they're fabricating Parkps, they could be working with all kinds of different toxic solvents.",We need to search the dorm.
We need to search the dorm. We?,"Oui. Allons-y. While we're out, do a thoracoscopic lung biopsy and a c-ANCA, because it's sarcoidosis."
So you really did force his roommate to hack into the laptop?,Why would I lie?
"It's your girlfriend's, isn't it?","She's not my girlfriend. I'm just interested in her because she's a client, and she sleeps above her covers four feet above her covers."
So that's why she's so mad you looked through her computer?,"No, that part happened after she got mad. First she got mad. Then I stole her computer to fix things. And then we got the case."
"Wait, so you tried to fix your relationship by stealing her computer?","Well, when you say it like that! Yes."
No way. You didn't get her laptop by blowing down the door of her office. That's from Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.,Just seeing if you're still paying attention. It was actually more subtle.
Excuse me. But there are others here who would like a chance to speak.,Go right ahead.
Go right ahead. No!,Audience is always right.
You poisoned a room full of Patients so you could steal your girlfriend's laptop?,I didn't poison anybody.
Although it worked out just as well. They're morons.,Agreed.
"No, not the Patients, the kids. It doesn't matter how you stole it. What matters is why.","You know, you're starting to remind me of someone."
I didn't ask how you stole it. I asked why.,Holding the laptop. Isn't it obvious?
You think you can tell why she's mad by reading budget spreadsheets and per diem schedules?,I know why she's mad.
Why is she mad?,"I was myself, which, by the way, she's supposed to love unconditionally."
"Went to a blues club, we watched Cinderfella on DVD. And?","It doesn't matter. She's being unreasonable, and I have to fix it. I need to know what's really important to her. I need something big."
I need something big. Because?,We're past that.
Have you tried Parkldhood pet names?,I don't know her pets.
She's nEver mentioned a pet?,"Well, yeah, but I wasn't listening. She's not mad because I don't remember a dead dog's name."
Just got a case from the E.R. Rutgers student came in with what looked like acute bronParktis. But there's nothing in his blood or sputum cultures.,Don't you think it's time you people stop looking to the white Man to solve all your pRoblems?
His O-2 sats are in the toilet. If we don't figure out what's attacking his,So figure it out! I'm busy.
That can't be true.,Why not?
"'Cause if he was dying I mean, you're a doctor.",Patients die Every day. Not all of them are interesting.
You still haven't answered either question.,She was mad because she's genetically programmed to make a big deal out of Every little thing.
"Actually, she's not like that.",Why are you sticking up for her? She says you're a pathetic jerk and she hates you.
Really? Really.,Really?
"Hey. Uh, and no peck on the cheek. It has to be on the lips.",Winning a bet to force her to kiss you actually cuts against your theory that you know how she thinks.
I wasn't forcing her to do anything that she didn't want to do.,You're hoping for a career in the NBA or the NFL?
Not Even close to true. I just couldn't beliEve I'd lose.,"Ah, now we're getting somewhere."
"No, we're not.","Oh, I thought we were."
"No, you thought we weren't, and that's exactly what you want, because you don't want to tell us why was she mad at you! You tell us you don't want to do your job because you're too busy trying to break into your girlfriend's laptop to figure out a way to make her not mad at you. But you don't tell us why she was mad at you.",It's stupid.
It's stupid. Talk.,I'm out of here. Unless!
Rachel's gonna be up soon.,"Well, you nEver know."
"Yes, I do. Can you take the garbage out before you go?","Uh, I-I-I would, but! He points at his painful leg."
"Oh, come on. It's not a lot.",Pain's always worst first thing in the morning.
That's so gross.,What's the big deal? It's not like she had a pRoblem swapping spit the night before.
"Well, maybe it's not the swapping spit that bothers her, but the fact that you don't listen to her. Had she warned you not to do it?","Oh, I listen to her."
But you just said before that you didn't.,"No, I said I didn't remember what she said."
"No, you said you don't listen","I listen to her. Okay? BeliEve me, I listen."
"It's my toothbrush, and it's not just once. And it's not like I'd Even care, but you totally destroy it. You're supposed to brush with it, not gnaw on it like a rawhide bone.",I think Miss Four Cavities' time would be better spent copying Mr.
Would you please just use the toothbrush I bought you?,"Would you please just shut up and watch the movie? She turns her head to look at him. He meets her eyes. I said, please."
Why would you have to brush your teeth before you go to dinner?,You don't want to know! yet.
You're gross and dumb. You listen to what she says just so you can tell her how wrong she is.,You are clueless and naive.
But not you.,I already kissed her. And I respect her enough not to treat her like some tender blossom who needs to be coddled.
"No, I didn't punch her.",You're a moron.
I didn't mean to. The stick had wicked heel curve.,Did I mention you're a moron?
"Okay, you just said it's wrong to treat your girlfriend like she's weaker than you.",I'm not talking about trying to score. I'm talking about shooting high. Tennis shoes on a wooden floor? She obviously can't butterfly and cover the low corners.
"I must be in the midst of a complex partial seizure, 'cause I know you are not sitting at my desk.",Sorry. Ran out of lotion in mine.
Get the hell out of here.,Can't. This is the only place left that Cuddy'll nEver look for me. And I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
"Well, I can tell you, what you're about to find is my foot in your ass.",I don't think we've got enough lotion for that.
How did you Even get in here? The door was locked.,"Well, either I can walk through walls, or! We have liftoff."
Is that Cuddy's journal?,"No, it's a freelance piece I'm writing for Teen Vogue. He closes it."
"No, no, no. Let me see that.","Sorry, got to go. He gets up."
Holding out his hand. Key.,"I got to give you one thing, Hourani. Your wife she's beautiful. I mean, wow."
"So that's why you're here? Well, that was stupid.",I know. He answers his cellphone. Mr. Stupid-Head at your service.
Where are you now?,In the principal's office.
"House, we don't have time for games. Pet scan was negative for sarcoidosis.",Great. Means the treatment's already working.
"It would if we'd actually started the treatment, but we didn't.",Why the hell not?
"Because it's not sarcoidosis. If you were here, you would know that. He's dying. What's left of his lung is collapsing. F.N.A. of the mediastinal",I don't care about the F.N.A. What I care about is how he responds to the treatment.
What I care about is how he responds to the treatment. House.,Just do it.
"Well, who cares? What did she write in her journal?",Thank you. That is exactly my point. Why does no one Ever beliEve me?
Why does no one Ever beliEve me? What?,Just because he's dying doesn't make it interesting.
"You cheated on her, didn't you?","No, I didn't cheat on her."
It's obviously more than just you used her toothbrush and wouldn't take the garbage out.,"No, actually, it was exactly that."
I just need some time alone.,Because I used your toothbrush?
And you wouldn't take out the garbage.,"That's insane. You know that, right?"
"You do whatEver you want, always.",I said I was sorry. I was I was still half asleep. I wasn't paying attention.
"And you're always right. And I don't mean you always think you're right. But y-you are actually always right, because that's all that matters.","That doesn't Even make sense. What, you want me to be wrong?"
That's what I said. You don't listen to her.,You didn't say that.
"Yes, I did.","Well, I wasn't listening, then."
"But you found a way to fix things, right? That's why you were happy when you read her laptop.",I did. At least I thought I did.
I did. At least I thought I did.,She recently got the thin envelope from her first choice preschool.
What other school would he be talking about? Just finish the story.,"You know, I got to tell you there is bossy, which can be sexy. And then there's bitchy"
Finish the story.,"You obviously know this because you're on the school board, which puts you on the inside, and being the CEO here obviously connects you with Cuddy."
"Well, if we're so connected, why isn't she the one asking?",Because she thinks it's wrong to use connections to cut in line. I don't.
I might be able to help.,Fantastic.
Where are you?,I needed to take care of something.
It's not a foreign body. He is in the scan room with Masters. They are talking to House via speakerphone.,You must have missed it.
"If we do any more imaging, we're gonna have to add radiation poisoning to the DDX.",I meant the sarcoidosis.
We're gonna have to do a pneumonectomy .,"No sign of drug or alcohol abuse. He's not a smoker, a coal miner, or a potter it's sarcoidosis. Start him on corticosteroids and methotrexate."
"If it's a drug-resistant bug, and we give him steroids","He'll die, which from the sound of it wouldn't be much worse. Suddenly House slams on his brakes! too late he's rear-ended the car in front of him. You moron."
But you have to show him your I.D. And your insurance stuff. You can't just give him a fake name.,"You don't have to do anything. Last time I checked, this was still America. Of course, that was ten years ago."
"But you're gonna pay him, right? I mean, it was your fault.",A yellow light does not mean stop.
"A yellow light does not mean stop. It was, at the most, 20% my fault. Since insurance companies automatically put 100% of the fault on the rear-ender, my little lie was actually an effort to aParkEve an outcome closer to the truth. And it would have worked, too, if it weren't for those meddling kids.",I am Dr. Hourani.
Then why did you say the other doctor was Hourani?,"It's, uh it's a common name. It's like Smith! in Lebanon."
Standing up and walking toward House. Let me see your I.D.,"I told you, I left it in my other pants."
Really? 'Cause it looks like it's still in this pair.,Get your hands off me.
Give me your I.D.,"Hey, would you stop that?"
"Give me your I.D. Gentlemen, please.",What? What?
"No, you wouldn't.",How do you know?
"You're right. It's just! I really like you. And I'm pretty sure you like me too. But I don't want to play any more games. When you want I mean, if you Ever want to, just tell me you're ready, and, you know! Sorry.",Well done.
but she's usually right. 05-15-1959,Thank you.
"Dr. House, can I ask you a question? Are you insane or just stupid?",Is there a third option?
Mm-hmm. And you think you can do that by getting someone to pull strings to get her daughter into our preschool. I spoke to Sanford Wells. They sit on either side of the principal's desk.,You can call the police. You can turn me in for lying at the accident.
"Oh, I'm sure Mr. Dryden has already taken care of that.","Let her daughter in. She's a great kid, and Dr. Cuddy is a great mom. They'll fit in perfectly here."
"And how exactly does admitting her daughter prove how unselfish you are? Seems like you're still doing it to help yourself, not anyone else.",I don't know. I just know that I need to do something. I need her in my life. You know what it's like to actually need someone?
Dr. House! is there anything you'd like to say?,Can I be excused?
Can I be excused?,"It's just food. Something small enough to go down the wrong pipe, too big to get washed out by the bronParkal lavage."
Wouldn't show up on a C.T.,But would cause the C.O.P.D. And wouldn't respond to steroids or antibiotics. Prep him for exploratory surgery and start the betting.
Prep him for exploratory surgery and start the betting. Betting?,I got a hundred bucks says it's a pea.
I got a hundred bucks says it's a pea. I'm busy.,I know. He closes the door. I just want to say that I'm sorry.
Shouldn't you be saying that to Sanford Wells? A fifth-grade career day? You really thought you could pull that off?,"I figured, how hard could it be?"
Is that why you also stole my computer?,"Yes, it is."
And then threw it in the trash?,"I did not throw it, I placed it, knowing that the janitor would find it and know it was yours and return it to you unharmed."
So what were you an Astronaut or a Bullfighter?,I was myself!
House. House turns around. You want to come over for dinner tonight?,I'd love to.
"House! The elevator door close in front of her, she takes the other one. When she gets out of it, people are leaving the first one, which looks empty. She walks away, looking annoyed, then smiles, turns back and slips in the elevator where House is hiding, stuck to the wall. I assume you're avoiding me because of the charity gala.",This Friday? It's completely slipped my mind.
So you'll be there?,"No, I meant it slipped my mind to tell you I'm not going."
What do you think it'll look like if you don't show up when I get an award?,"Like I don't give a crap about awards, charities, what it looks like."
If you Ever want!,I RSVPed two days ago.
"If you were already going, why did you!",Foreplay. The elevator door close. They both smile.
Looking for a tie. What's the big deal?,"Obviously, he wants you out of the closet for some reason."
"He's lying. House waits for more. He's not an executive. I saw his hands. They're covered with calluses and little cuts. He works with them. A lot. The men look at her, speechless.",Hmm. Baby steps. Go down there and do it.
But what if I'm wrong? I'll just end up offending him.,"Consider that part a bonus. She seems unsure. All right, I'll send along one of your big brothers to help. You want scary, smarmy, or shorty?"
Place has been cleaned and sanitized by our Patient. We sent for the autopsy report! pRobably take a week to get it.,"When he's not working, where does he go all day to hide out?"
His old real estate office?,"Treat for bacterial infection. Meantime! Bert, take Ernie and check his office for environmentals. I'll talk to Cuddy about getting the autopsy results faster. He leaves."
You're really going to the charity gala?,Why? I wanna do something nice for my girlfriend.
You nEver do anything unless it stands to benefit you.,"I realize that three failed marriages can leave a Man twisted and bitter inside, but in a good relationship, people sometimes do things for each other."
She! she didn't! Giving up 300. She really wants you there.,Why do people beliEve I'm incapable of doing anything nice?
Maybe we're thinking too far outside the box here. Just because he could have picked up any one of a hundred exotic diseases from his job doesn't mean he didn't.,"Taub's life partner has a point. Started treatment with antibiotics, and he got worse. Simple answer begins with m ends with mia."
Simple answer begins with m ends with mia. Meningococcemia?,"That works too. Confirm with a lumbar puncture. And on the off chance we're wrong, find out what else he's been lying about besides his job and his drug use."
How'd that work out? Not well.,I need some intel on this charity Event on Friday night.
Show up and behave. PRoblem solved.,Your pRoblem solved. Don't you think she deserves more than a plaque and a round of applause for 15 years of running this dump?
"It's a watch, not a plaque.","It's a clich. I want to make things more exciting, something she'll remember for more than ten minutes."
"In rare cases, a tick or a spider bite could set it off!",Show of hands. Who's going to this charity thing Friday night? Chase and Taub rise hands.
Already got a date.,"Cuddy is getting an award. I think we should all be there, show our support."
"I assume you're planning on screwing it up, so you want to maximize witnesses.",Why does Everyone go to that?
Why does Everyone go to that? Experience?,Shut up!
"I! I, uh, better go check on him. He tries to leave with dignity, but has to run out. House smiles.","Swollen joints, high white count, fEver. Conjunctivitis. Anyone?"
"Well, we would have seen it in his blood work. Unless the saline used to recover and store the tissue samples has been shown in recent studies!",Get new blood and CSF samples using formaldehyde instead of saline. And start him and his wife on triple antifungal therapy.
And start him and his wife on triple antifungal therapy. His wife?,"Well, if he's really trying to keep her happy, I assume they've shared bodily fluids. They leave the room, leaving Taub and Foreman, still in their stalls, alone."
Hey! House whistles. The music stops.,Huh?
What are you doing?,What's it look like I'm doing? Auditioning a band for Friday night.
"I think, if you do this, your Evening will end with you in your apartment alone! with a sock.","Muchachos, adelante. Tres, cuatro! The music starts back, with House conducting it."
Except it's nEver been documented to cause hearing loss. Ever.,"Oh, no, she di'int!"
"This isn't the classroom. In the real world, real doctors know that Patients can have more than one thing wrong with them.",Zing.
You have a better idea?,I do.
Or a viral infection that's reached his brain.,I say we go with Ernie on this one. Get an MRI. Find it.
"What do you want us to do, House?","If it's a tumor, we start chemo. Bombard his head with radiation."
"And without an MRI, we don't Even know if he has one.","He's definitely dead if we do nothing. If I'm wrong, all we do is shave a few hours off."
We'll need his wife's consent.,Masters will get it.
"Uh, he's right.","No, he's not. Consider this me officially booting you out of the nest."
"I didn't mean any of those awful things I said. I'm so sorry. I love you, Bert. I've always loved you. I also kept a secret from you. I was gonna tell you at the restaurant! but you got sick. And I wanted to wait until you felt better. I'm pregnant, sweetheart. You're gonna be a daddy.",Why rash again?
Two hours before the rash came back. They're not connected.,What was he doing two hours before he broke out the first time?
Crime scene and an MRI. Still not seeing the connection.,We've been missing connections this entire case. Did he say anything? Did he show any signs of stress in the MRI room?
"He said he was cold, but it's always freezing in there.",Cold and rash.
Muckle-Wells syndrome? There's only been a couple thousand documented cases in the U.S.,"Well, now there's a couple thousand and one."
It is dark and rainy outside. You okay?,Why wouldn't I be? Solved my case.
I just came to apologize. You're right. I am turning bitter and cynical inside.,You're finally putting the cat down. Wilson glares at House. House gives up. She loves mariaPark. I told you.
We've got 15 minutes to get there if we wanna see the board freak when House's mariaPark band marches in.,"All of them are gone, Wilson. They're all dead because I am screwed up."
You lost one Patient. And it wasn't your fault.,"What about that mom who gave her baby cancer? If I'd figured that one out quicker, she'd still be a mom alive."
She refused treatment when it was offered. How is that your fault?,And there was that guy I spent a day trapped in isolation with. He was five feet away the whole time. Just watched him die like an idiot.
"Yeah. You've lost Patients before, and you'll lose Patients again. Why!",Exactly! Why? Because love and happiness are! nothing but distractions. The only thing my relationship with Cuddy has done for me is make me a worse doctor.
Right. The great Dr. House doesn't deserve to be happy. You know it's not true.,My happiness is being paid for by other people's lives. Softly How is she?
"First! first, you're not driving anywhere. And second, you are definitely not talking to Cuddy like this.","Okay. I'm gonna walk. He leaves the pub, limping and stumbling at the same time. Wilson stays at the counter, watches him go and sighs."
"Okay. I'm gonna walk. He leaves the pub, limping and stumbling at the same time. Wilson stays at the counter, watches him go and sighs.","We really, really need to talk."
"House? House? She gets out of bed and takes a few steps toward the bathroom, stretParkng and trying to wake up. A hand comes out from under the bed and grabs her ankle. Oh! My God! What the hell?",Muahahahaaaaahhh His head pops out from under the bed. He is grinning. Gotcha.
Did you actually wake up early and hide under the bed just to scare the crap outta me?,Set an alarm and Everything.
It's like dating a ten-year-old.,"God, I hope not. She smiles and joins him on the floor, draping across his chest as they kiss. Now that we're down here!"
Hold that thought. She gets up.,Seriously?
I have to pee.,"I'll wait. I brought a book. He reaches under the bed, pulls out a book and starts to read. I didn't know what time your alarm was set for."
from the bathroom House?,"You know, you can rent this space out down here. In Japan, that would be like a deluxe"
You really don't have to be here.,You're my girlfriend. I'm being supportive.
I'm mainly talking about them.,"Well, given that there's almost certainly nothing wrong with you, and my Patient definitely has something wrong with him"
That can't wait an hour?,'Fraid not. He's! House is stumped Chase.
16-year-old male spit up blood during a pick-up basketball game. E.R. couldn't find the source in his lungs or GI tract.,See? Serious.
Get them outta here. My urethra is not for public entertainment.,But it is a good-time adjacent. to the team Feed the kid a camera. Check his gut for angiodysplasia.
All right. If you could scoot down.,"confidentially to the urologist Hey, I'm, uh, I'm missing a watch. So can you keep your eyes open while"
Imaging showed no sign of upper GI issues. But the kid did admit to being depressed and to smoking pot to take the edge off.,"You are very pleased with yourself, aren't you?"
"His marijuana could be laced with formaldehyde or lead, which could cause a pulmonary hemorrhage which could make him spit up blood. House waits. Yes. Yes, I am. I thought it was a good catch.",to Taub Run a lead lEvel and push 5 liters IV fluid.
Feel free to tip your other server.,Cystoscopy was clean. Cytopathology was normal.
Why do you have my lab results?,"tosses them on the desk I don't. If I did, I'd know you were fine."
Unless the blood came from my kidneys.,"Come on. Your hypochondriac mom had a brush with mortality last month, and it's understandable that you're worrying more than usual, worrying that you might turn into her."
"You're right. Odds are, this is nothing.",Meet me in the cafeteria in ten. There'll be a corn dog with your name on it. I mean an actual corn dog. They fixed the deep fryer.
Gets a lot narrower if we factor in his depression.,"Oh, don't do that!"
Mood swings can be a symptom of physiological illness.,I'm not talking to you. He was talking to the computer.
"Infection makes the most sense. He shoots hoops at school, showers in the locker room. I'm thinking staph.",Damn!
You don't think,Not talking to you!
Everything okay with Cuddy?,She's fine. She's just too stupid to accept it. Start him on nafcillin for staph.
"All that's in the, uh, First Mutual safety deposit box. The retirement accounts",You're freaking out because of one ultrasound performed by an incompetent Bonobo monkey.
As demonstrated by my sitting here calmly going about my business.,"shrill Calling a Lawyer, drafting a will!"
"I'm a single mom. I need to set up a trust, appoint a guardian. It's silly that I haven't done it before now.",But you're doing it now because you think you're sick. The freaking out can at least wait until after the biopsy this afternoon.
The biopsy's not till tomorrow. It's the first opening in the schedule.,"For the Dean of Medicine, the first opening in the schedule is!"
My worry isn't any more important than anyone else's.,"Actually, it is."
"But I'm not sick, right?",quietly Good point. He leaves.
I'll get it.,from the other room That better be her!
entering with Rachel Mouth on that kid makes Mel Gibson sound like Nelson Mandela. Where'd she learn that?,"I don't know why you're here, but I didn't do it."
Are either of you this girl's father?,Nope.
coming from the bathroom I'm not sure. I think I just peed blood.,Looks like peeing blood is the new black.
"Scoping showed no sign of a bleed in his bladder, which points to a kidney pRoblem.",PRobably some kinda mass.
"Kidney mass wouldn't explain the coughing blood or the hemorrhages. Antiphospholipid syndrome, on the other hand!",Makes sense. But doesn't rule out a mass.
You think it's cancer?,Mass doesn't have to be cancer. Could be renal hematoma.
Cuddy has a mass on her kidney?,It's pRobably just a complex cyst or angiomyolipoma.
And then you pointed out how sweet that was.,"If it were heroin, he'd be going through withdrawal. Antiphospholipid syndrome's a better fit. Start the Patient on plasmapheresis."
"While he's doing that, can I at least search his House for drugs?",Have I Ever said no to that question?
Have I Ever said no to that question?,What are you doing here?
What are you doing here? Pie-eating contest.,Cuddy's biopsy is in an hour. You should be keeping her company.
"Okay. You've been worried that your relationship is getting in the way of your diagnoses, you're protecting your Patient. Either that or! you're an ass.",Three I hate the smell of death.
The chances of Cuddy having renal cell carcinoma,"I'm talking about our relationship. She needs support and comfort, both things that I famously suck at. This will inevitably lead to"
You know what's good for that? Practice. Doing it I don't know once?,I'm not gonna act like there's a crisis before we know there is one. There's no proof there's anything wrong with her.
"There's no proof she's being stalked by Ninja squirrels either, but if she's scared of them! as her boyfriend, it's your job to figure out how to help her feel better.",thinks this over and nods You're right.
Look at this.,Chase? How'd it go with Cuddy? Chase?
Chase? Aah!,Good thing I brought my ax cane.
from somewhere nearby House! help me!,I'm coming!
I'm coming! House! please!,It looks like we got company.
House! House turns and tries to loCate the sound of her voice. Aah! aah!,shouting No!
aah! shouting No!,Ah!
Are you okay?,I was sleeping. What could go wrong?
"So what causes bleeding, kidney pRoblems, and unilateral numbness?",And a complete absence of any record of Cuddy's kidney biopsy. She must have put it under a false name so I couldn't rush the results.
"What if we had it backwards and it's not a bleeding pRoblem, it's a clotting pRoblem?",There's no Patient file created in the last two days for anyone having that procedure.
She backdated the file? That's very clEver.,Hands off. She's mine.
House. House looks at him. We're worried too.,How sweet. I'm not worried. I just wanna get the results so she can stop worrying.
"Okay, but in the meantime",Do an angiogram. You two go to pathology and look at Cuddy's slides.
You just said you didn't know which sample was hers.,I guess you're gonna have to look at them all.
What are you doing?,Pie-eating contest.
"I was going to send Chase to tell you what the obvious right thing to do here is, but then I realized! if you were too stupid to know how stupid that was, you might miss the irony. You have to be with her.",Yeah. I get it. She needs artificial support for an artificial pRoblem. She's fine.
She doesn't sleep with Chase.,We don't know that. Masters knocks on the open door and enters. Hey! Eating pie in here.
House! I'm not gonna tell you a third time. Do not screw this up. Because I really don't wanna clean up the mess. He leaves.,He's referring to the pie.
"Fourteen Patients with kidney biopsies. I tabulated them against their urinalysis results. Six men, three diabetics, one LCDD, one kid, two seniors, and by default, one! Cuddy. She waits for the praise that isn't coming. She approaches him with the file. Uh! the biopsy was inconclusive. The mass is near the center of her kidney. They couldn't get a readable sample.",Means they'll have to remove the mass to know if it's cancer or not.
"The file says they're doing some imaging now, give the surgeon a better idea of what he's dealing with.",calling from the living room Can we order pizza? There's nothing in the fridge. At least not anymore. What's happening with the Patient?
"Angio showed a clot in a branch of his middle cerebral artery. Started him on streptokinase to break it up. Although! maybe we should have just played a few rounds of Savagescape 2 The REvenge, because that's obviously the best way to make someone feel better.","You keep talking like Wilson, your face will freeze like that."
"Honey, I'm home.",Just in time. Pot roast is ready.
Pot roast is ready. Smells wonderful!,"I cured all my Patients, so I came home to spend time with Rachel."
Your LSATs? You're eight years old.,"We've been studying together. Fake aside, out of the corner of his mouth to Rachel It was supposed to be a surprise."
"Well, that's wonderful. She pats Rachel on the head as she goes to put her briefcase down.",I think Rachel deserves a treat. He pulls a lollipop out of his apron pocket.
I'm not 29! House walks over to take the cake from Wilson. You're not limping. This isn't possible. None of this is possible.,Girl can dream.
Got your scans back from today.,Yeah. Foreman sees the look on his face and stops shooting video monsters. Okay. He hangs up.
What's going on?,Imaging shows enhancing masses across multiple lobes of Cuddy's lungs.
That's what kidney cancer looks like when it metastasizes.,She's dead.
What was that thing?,I got a great idea where we should go.
I don't want to hear it.,You're gonna love it. Australia's Finest. There's a great karaoke bar in Newark
I hate karaoke.,"They got Every Every song by Every Aussie artist. Midnight Oil, Men at Work, Olivia Newton John."
I do a mean version of Physical.,And the barbecue shrimp is amazing.
What about the fries?,Hot and salty and delicious. He pulls a candy bar out of his pocket and starts to eat it. She stares at it. Talking about food made me hungry.
You had candy in my other dreams.,Means you're stressed at work. All dream symbols mean you're stressed at work. Or castration anxiety.
No. I was hoping! She puts his gun in his hand you'd figure out a way to handle all this. Maybe you can't because you're still a Parkld.,"I can do better. They push themselves to stand, leaning against the wall."
House! Ah!,I should have been here. Sorry.
voice over House couldn't concentrate on the case before she was dying. You think he's gonna get in the game now?,"If you don't make it, I won't sleep with anyone for at least a month."

Me! House.,Your tumor was benign. An oncocytoma. They cut it out. You'll be fine.
Then what was in my lungs?,"Once they ruled out cancer, I remembered that your mom was allergic to antibiotics."
"Ugh! Wait. She takes it and studies it intently. There are so Many things that I could be afraid of, and most of the time, I Manage to! lock them up behind doors. But this happens! all those doors just burst open. House gets a far-away look. You just figured something out about your Patient, didn't you? Her smile is both indulgent and proud. Go. Do what you do.",Take him off the meds. He's got a staph infection.
You treated him for staph three days ago. It didn't work.,"Bacteria already in his system responded. But once a door's been busted open, more just keep coming."
I got that.,"For the cheap seats, an abscess is a gooey little cream puff of infection. PRobably burst when your little pride and homicidal joy took a hard foul."
"You took Vicodin. House's face falls. He looks guilty and terrified. When you came to my hospital room that night, you were stoned.",also ashamed. He can't look her in the eyes. How did you know?
How did I not know? How did I make myself forget for months that you're an addict? My subconscious was trying to tell me you could nEver get through this without drugs.,It was a one-time thing.
"It's not about the pills, House. It's about what they mean.",I was scared because I thought my girlfriend might die.
"No. You don't take Vicodin because you're scared. You take it so you won't feel pain. Everything you've Ever done is to avoid pain drugs, sarcasm! Keeping Everybody at arm's length so no one can hurt you.",As opposed to Everyone else in the world who goes looking for pain like it's buried treasure?
"sad Pain happens when you care. Y-you can't love someone without making yourself open to their pRoblems, their fears. And you're not willing to do that.",I caI came to be with you.
"But you weren't with me, not really.",I wanted to be.
That's not enough.,imploring I can do better.
"I don't think you can. They stare at each other. You'll choose yourself over Everybody else over and over again, because that's just who you are. I'm sorry.","No. No, no, no. Don't. Don't."
I thought I could do this.,Don't. Please don't.
I was about to ask you the same thing.,I'm fine.
Okay. following House into the hotel room and closing the door,I assume Cuddy told you that she dumped me.
I assume Cuddy told you that she dumped me. She did.,And that I'm back on Vicodin.
She told me you had taken a Vicodin.,And then I took a lot more. He takes another one. And so on.
But you're fine?,"Well, I'm not fine as in fine, but I'm fine as in you don't have to worry about me."
"Because you cleared out your bank account, checked into a hotel, and started back on Vicodin?",Because I'm going to be fine as in fine very soon.
"Until that happens, are you sure Vicodin is the!",My leg hurts.
You've been able to handle the pain.,It's gotten worse.
Not physically worse.,Worse is worse.
So you don't want to just avoid the issue. You want to avoid avoiding the issue. Sorry.,Nothing is either as bad or as good as we think it is at the time.

"Thank you very much. And if there's anything else I can do to make your stay here more enjoyable, just ring the concierge and ask for Carnell.",biting a strawberry Eat fast. We're expecting company.
Okay. This might not be such a bad idea.,What do you think he meant by anything?
Take some time for yourself. Relax.,"I know it's a figure of speech, to underline the anything."
Maybe talk to someone?,Already scheduled.

"Okay. That's! great. pause I meant, like, a counselor.",I know.
But you meant a hooker.,Yeah. Baby steps.
ENG was normal. Means his inner ear isn't!,Morons.
Morons. It wasn't!,Whoa.
Who was that?,Something Carnell got me.
It wasn't that ridiculous of a theory.,Great theory.
That's not from the pipes. It's from your mouth.,"Can you pass me the, um!"
"Can you pass me the, um!",What took you so long?
"There's nothing wrong with his ears, but he's got blood in his sputum.",Doesn't answer the question.
We weren't avoiding you. It took us a little time to think up a diagnostic test no one's Ever thought up before.,Apology accepted.
Foreman starts to talk but Chase interrupts. It could be a tumor in a salivary gland. We should get a parotid biopsy.,"indulgently Oh, that's so cute. You're fighting over who's in charge."
GI bleed's more likely to explain the nausea and weakness.,Who's in charge?
"House, as long as you're not here, someone has to have the final!",Let me rephrase. Who's your daddy?
"Let me rephrase. You have to decide if you're gonna buck up, get out of bed, and do your job, or if you're gonna wallow in self-pity.",Those my only two choices?
That is not true in so Many ways.,"And, Chase, stop screwing with Foreman."
"Wait, House, should we be more worried about you? Are you on Vicodin? Because if you are, you pRobably shouldn't be ordering procedures.",I am not on Vicodin. He swallows a Vicodin. Do the tests. I have to see a Man about a hurdy-gurdy.
"Sclerae turned yellow. Did X-rays. Looks like there's a mass in his liver,","Making it, as they say, as tough to find as a hooker who can play the hurdy-gurdy."

It's gone now.,It's a mass! He's in bed. And then it's not.
"You, uh, gonna introduce us?","Team, meet Duke."
"Team, meet Duke. Anke.",Anke? How'd I get Duke?

You think sticking a needle directly into his brain would be less dangerous than sticking it in his spine?,"It's pRobably a push. I'm just trying to get you out of here, because underneath this sheet, confidentially stuff is going on."
"It's pRobably a push. I'm just trying to get you out of here, because underneath this sheet, confidentially stuff is going on.",Just pick a spot and stick a needle in it.
It's definitely his feet. Please don't.,That is a nice bow.

And I'm only eight paces away. House!,"I like you, Carnell. Don't ruin it. He turns on the phone. Stinky feet can point to diabetes, athlete's foot, or gangrene! Pick one."
No. No. No. No. You're gonna kill her.,"Don't do that, Carnell."
So's MRI'ing his heart. He's got a sEven-centimeter conductive metal rod holding his rib together. It'll rip him in two.,"aiming and pulling back on the bowstring No, it'll just feel like it's ripping him in two, which is much better."

"No, you didn't.","Yes, we did."
You're an ass.,"Okay. Go get me, uh, general Patton's colt 45. The door opens The one with the two notches."
"You were bored. You must have spent about two days setting up a fake murder, and you were bored.",I'm fine.
You're not. And I'm worried you might do something Even stupider. Why don't you move back in with me? At least until you get back on track.,What an ego. You think you're some sort of emotional paragon? You're my rock?
I'm trying to be a friend.,At least I have the good sense not to marry Every Woman I fall into bed with. Maybe you should move in with me.
Either way. If you prefer!,getting annoyed I prefer you to stop talking about this.
"House, we haven't Even started talking about this except to establish the fact that you are fine, which clearly you aren't.",loudly Leave me alone!
"No. We are gonna talk about this, and we're gonna deal with this.",So I have no choice?
You can't go backwards. I can't fix his pRoblem. I am his pRoblem.,"If the infection's not in his heart, then it's in his brain. You're in my sun. Do a CT."
We can't. He has a titanium plate and a bunch of metal screws.,So get rid of them.
His skull has multiple hairline fractures. Removing the metal plate will be like removing half an eggshell without cracking the rest of the shell.,"sits up, supporting his leg And not removing the plate will be like leaving the egg out to rot."
We can't cut off the top of his head based on a few symptoms that disappear whenEver we try to test for them.,What if the one symptom that hasn't disappeared was nEver actually there?
His E.E.G. didn't show any sign of seizure activity.,I didn't say it was a seizure. I said it was something like a seizure.
And I'm guessing you're about to tell us we need to find something like an E.E.G. to prove!,"Nope, 'cause I already got one. Stands and takes a wad of bills out of his pocket, which he hands to Hooker 6."
You want me to sing? How's singing My Bonnie gonna help you see inside my brain?,It won't.
"We think you're having mini blackouts, but your brain compensates.","It can't compensate if there's a preset rhythm. He sets a metronome on the bed tray. One, two, three."
"Lane, that wasn't Even close. to House That was brilliant.",unenthusiastically Yeah.
unenthusiastically Yeah. It's understandable.,"I hate when you do that. You respond to what you think I'm thinking, because you think that I think like you do. It's insulting and annoying."
"You're scared because nothing excites you. Fun doesn't excite you. Puzzles don't excite you. What's left? And I was saying you're right. You're upset. You're depressed. Everything's gonna taste a little worse right now, but it'll pass.","It's understandable. You're scared because you think I'm falling apart, and you're trying to convince yourself that you're overreacting."
"It's understandable. You're scared because you think I'm falling apart, and you're trying to convince yourself that you're overreacting.",answering Yeah.
"House, there's no infection in this guy's brain. CT's clean.","Well, that sucks. Now we have to blow up his heart."
"We're not blowing up his heart, because we've ruled out his heart. MRI and transesophageal echo rEveal no swelling, no masses, no vegetation, no sign of anything.",'Cause we're looking the wrong way. Holds up the straw. There's an imperfection. How do you find where?
I don't know. Get a magnifying glass and!,"You suck. Feel free to interpret that both ways. Suck on the straw, see where the drink leaks."
You're saying we put pressure on his aorta until it rips open? You do realize the downside of that?,"If we don't rip it, the damage from the infection will, pRobably not when he's got his chest open in an O.R."
It's a ridiculous idea. It won't work.,Now if you don't mind! get this guy's approval to rip his heart open.
Now if you don't mind! get this guy's approval to rip his heart open.,Hey.
Any questions? Nope.,Really? You don't Even want to know if you'll be able to go back to bull riding?
"I assume no? I mean, you've already cracked open my skull, and now you're gonna blow up my heart.",puzzled Thought you loved those eight seconds.
"You didn't expect me to say yes to rupturing his aorta, did you?","calm and deliberate Since I didn't ask, I wasn't expecting you to say anything at all."
You have no reason to beliEve this will save his life.,mirthless laugh Really?
somewhat pitying I don't know. I think maybe you're looking for something that can excite you. Fill a void. And it's affecting your judgment.,You're right.
"You're right. I am. But my damaged, depressed, drug-addled judgment is still better than yours or any other doctor in this hospital, and my team is gonna do this procedure and save his life. So you can either have security arrest me and my team, or you can get the hell out of my way.",contemptuous Annnnnd! she caves.
Heart looks good. The aorta's exposed.,I take it you ratted me out to Cuddy.
I think your judgment is compromised.,"No, you don't. He hits the intercom button with his cane. Come on. I got a squash game at 200. Let's give this cowboy a ride."
"If I inject more, there won't be any room for the blood to go through the rest of his body.",You're right. Let's make damn sure we don't damage his toes while we blow up his heart.
I was wrong.,Not yet.

"And what, you're openly mocking marriage! trying to prove it means nothing?",It doesn't. But you proved that yourself years ago.
"I'd love to keep guessing, but I've got people with tumors waiting. Why do you want us to think that you're getting married?",Only one theory left! I am. Dominika needs a green card.

The bleed could be caused by a G.I. obstruction.,"Vitamin O.D. makes sense, and it's easier to treat. Give him Tocopherol and zinc supplements for the excess vitamin A. If we're right! he could go homeless tomorrow."

This is serious. Did you know that she's!,"She's dying of guilt and feels horrible for dumping me. It's great. I mean, not the dumping part, but the part where she'll now let me do whatEver I want."

I found Danny's father.,Well done.
"The kid said he was in a state-sponsored rehab last November. There's only one Danny Jennings that was in treatment at the time, and he listed his father's address as his primary next of kin.",The well done was for making it quick. Now I'm gonna have to take that back.
He lives about 30 minutes from the hospital.,And the reason you're continuing to talk instead of driving there?
Chase and Masters are already on their way. Taub pauses and House looks up at him Why didn't you ask me to be part of your wedding?,You are genuinely upset at being mockingly snubbed by a mock wedding?

I changed my mind.,"What, you want the fish instead of the Parkcken?"
"This room is for Patients' families, not for doctors trying to defraud the government.","Oh, so! you've decided to take a moral stand."

"It's Lou, and I would have thrown him out too.","Well, where are we gonna go? We got Caterers staging Everything downstairs as we speak. We've got floral arrangements, place settings! Other wedding-y stuff."

I like you too.,I can't.
I can't. Why not?,I nEver sleep with married women. I'm going to bed. You can take the couch.
And we saved him.,Book you for 900?
Book you for 900? Yeah. Uh-huh.,Take the day off.
Take the day off. Thank you.,All right.
Thank you. All right.,So what did you do?
You figured out I was in jail but you don't know why?,I've been busy.
I've been busy. Excessive prescribing.,Not that busy. I know that you pled down to excessive prescribing. The question was what did you DO?
You owe me a body shot.,Make it fast. I'm driving. I don't want to end up in jail like!
Make it fast. I'm driving. I don't want to end up in jail like!,! A person should who used their phone illegally while driving.
Where are you?,On my way to the greater Schenectady Parkli cook-off and spud gun competition.
That's your Honeymoon? Thirteen is caught off-guard by the question.,"Nope, Dominika went to A.C. with her boyfriend."
"So diagnosis! boring. It's epistaxis. It's a nosebleed. Blood runs into his lungs, he coughs it back up, flu explains the rest of the symptoms.","Going once, going twice!"
"Toxic exposure to ammonia or sulfites can traumatize the lungs, cause neuralgias or fEvers. Fits better because of his radiating chest pain.",Sold. To Masters. She smiles widely. Do a home search for toxins. Draw cultures for bacteria and fungi.
Draw cultures for bacteria and fungi. You're married?,You were gone so long. Thirteen looks at House with insistence. Green card.
Thanks for not saying anything. I just need some time to!,I didn't do it for you. Some puzzles are just too good to share.
This is my exit. Parkli?,I hate Parkli. Love spud guns.
"What's this really all about, House? As convincing as I find your deep devotion to vegetable trajectory.","First of all, it's a tuber."
I'd only have to serve up fries until the medical board hearing.,"I stand corrected. You obviously have a rich, full life waiting for you. I'll slow down the car and you can roll out."
I don't Even have a change of clothes.,Damn. If only I'd planned for that.
Damn. If only I'd planned for that.,Okay.
You were running a bleeding heart medical consulting business for illegals or some other sympathetic under-class. No.,Over-class?
The interrogation thing is getting annoying.,Studies have shown that un-annoying interrogation is 50 percent less effective.
Why are you so determined to bring me to this competition? Why don't you bring Wilson?,Wilson thinks it's stupid.
I think it's stupid! She goes back inside the changing room.,"Junior year high school, you placed fourth in the West Virginia all-county science fair. Your project? Clean combustion."
Not that much.,I've been going to this contest for four years. For four years I've come second to a pissant named Harold Lam.
This is serious?,Second!
"Okay. I can help you, but I'm going to need to make a personal stop along the way.",What kind of stop?
"Okay, turn right.",You were writing bogus prescriptions for medical marijuana. He gets no answer from Thirteen. Please say no because you have to be an idiot to actually screw that up.
"No. I mean, I was, but I didn't get caught.","I have to admit, you have one of the best game faces I've Ever seen. Also one of the best game bodies."
Also one of the best game bodies. Pull over.,Didn't know you were a Jehovah's Witness.
"Yeah, the weak lost faith when Christ didn't return in '75, but I still beliEve.",You're really not gonna tell me what just happened?
"You know, I'm actually kind of hurt that you don't know what I did. I'm not worth bribing a court official or hacking into police records?",Where's the fun in that?
Lucas? Mm-hmm.,You don't know?
You're awfully quiet.,Sorry. That's just how I get around people who have recently killed a Man.
"It wasn't! You know, I've had a pretty rough year. Do you think maybe we could just give this whole thing a rest?",You killed a Man! But you pled out to drugs. Hit-and-run under the influence. Guy you kneed in the groin was your date who dropped a dime on you.
How do they not have 1/2-inch drill bits?,"By the way, Harold's pRobably gonna hit on you. Everything I have, he wants. Just turn him down flat. Unless!"
Yes. Let's stop shopping. I'll just do him and get him to throw the contest.,I'm not sugges! Caught off-guard Would you do that?
How's this thing Judged?,"Hang time, distance, and accuracy."
Categories weighted the same?,Yup.
"Screw accuracy. We're gonna double distance and hang time, beat Harold on points. We need raw power. Where's the fertilizer? She walks down another alley of the store.","By all means, Kaczynski."
"We can easily push it to 250, have your friend Harold peeing in his pants. Damn.",Be cool.
Damn. Be cool.,Harold.
House. You look good. I like that jacket on you.,Thanks. You filled out a little.
Who's the babe?,She's the boot in your ass. Perhaps you've heard of famed Russian physicist Olga Petrovich?
Olga Petrovich is 72 years old.,And her granddaughter works at a little place called JPL.
I did an internship there last summer.,She killed a Man.
"We rip out the combustion valve, replace it with disks. With enough pressure, it should blow out at maximum velocity.",Turning the spud into spudnik. What do we use for disks?
"Yeah, that line nEver works for me either.",That line always works for you.
That line always works for you.,So what did you do?
"You were right this morning. I met a guy at a coffee shop, we went back to my place, and he O.D.'d.",Damn. I could have saved myself a job offer.
So she had Q fEver and something else that causes heart attack?,"And the hoarding. Now that the wife is the only Patient, hoard is back on the board."
Or we were wrong about Q fEver. I don't buy it's just a coincidence.,It's not a coincidence.
Even the heart attack. Hydrogen sulfide is also a vasodilator.,"Which my crack team nEver tested the place for. Of course, half my crack team nEver tested the place for people."
Might be safer to just assume we're right and start treatment.,Go with God. And some air freshener.
"Shine up your spuds, folks. We're gonna start shooting for hang time in just a few minutes.",The wind's coming from the southeast. You have to aim five degrees to the left. He adjusts the spud-gun.
"We're gonna break 14 seconds. I can feel it. Smiling When I was 10 or 11, my dad used to take us to this county fair. And there was this kid! House looks confused. What?",Who's us?
Not Everything means something. We're gonna be up soon. I want to check the pressure. She picks up the gun and walks away.,You don't wake up in the middle of the night to cry over a dead stranger.
You don't wake up in the middle of the night to cry over a dead stranger. You don't confess to killing a Man and then hide the details unless the details rEveal more about you than the crime itself. pause You pled down to drugs. You've got a horrible genetic disease and a sibling who's suddenly on your mind.,You euthanized your brother. And that guy back at the House was the doctor who wouldn't help you cover it up.
The guy back at the House is my cellmate's boyfriend. He cheated on her when she was inside.,But I was right about Everything else.
You wouldn't. So?,Warning.
They gave you a warning?,"Well, it turns out our friend Harold felt up the sheriff's daughter last night at the potato mash mixer, so sheriff's feeling kind of ambivalent."
"You always get your way, don't you?",Not always. resigned Today would have been our one-year anniversary. pause Which is an incredibly arbitrary thing to celebrate.
We have a new symptom. Infertility. They wanted kids but couldn't have them. She started collecting things to fill the void. We should run a full hormone blood panel.,"Hey, Harriet the Spy, before you get too full of yourself, you might want to go back to bio 101. It takes two to not-tango."
Hubby could be shooting blanks.,So either it's a new symptom that will help us save her life or it's a complete waste of time.
So either it's a new symptom that will help us save her life or it's a complete waste of time.,"Figure out which is fried, the bacon or the eggs."
"House, who's that?",Radio. Thirteen looks both amused and bothered that she's been recognized.
Sounded a lot like! Thirteen.,"It's a Thirteen tribute band with their new song, I've got a better theory than Masters."
"No, we don't. She's been missing for a year.","You can ask her all about it when she comes in on Monday. He gives Thirteen a look, she slightly smiles."
"Can I talk? She said they nEver had kids, and you all jumped to infertility. You nEver considered the other option.",And the bitch is back. They both smile.
there's something seriously wrong with us. I know.,"Home, sweet home."
"Home, sweet home.",You owe me 87 bucks for gas.
You owe me 87 bucks for gas.,I'll kill you.
I'll kill you.,"When the time comes, if you want me to."
"When the time comes, if you want me to.",I'll do it now if you like. looking behind him. I think I've got a baseball bat in the back.
What the hell happened to you? Why'd you lie about going to Rome?,"loudly, from his office You'd lie too if you bottomed out, ended up in! drug rehab. He takes some pills."
I didn't Even know you had a pRoblem.,"Loved ones are always the last to know. Loved ones and Robotic, estranged ex-boyfriends. Our Patient is Kendall Pearson. 16-year-old aspiring pirate."
She's that Canadian kid who's trying to be the youngest person to sail around the world.,Collapsed yesterday during a practice run.
"Uh, last day as a student. Could be simple dehydration. She told the Coast Guard she had felt dizzy.",Pulse and BP were normal at the time of the rescue. It's not dehydration. What about your internship? You sign up this morning?
"But what about her back? Look. He replays part of the DVD Right before the collapse, she hit the small of her back on the railing. Damaged adrenal glands caused adrenal insufficiencies, which caused the collapse.",Nice.
What's with the sudden interest in her future?,"Sighs You know, a blacksmith who spends this much time hammering out a new blade from raw Jell-O! gets curious about who ends up wielding it."
"Before I make my decision, I still have one more LP I need to get. So I'd like to go to the E.R.","Thirteen, why don't you take Masters to do the blood draws. You can remind her about all the perks of working for me."
"Rehab? Great cover story. Now I can't Ever drink around those guys again, thus eliminating my main bond with Chase.",Save the attitude for someone who didn't just get you your medical license back. Price you pay.
There's a Parkcken in your office.,"No, there isn't."
"You lied about rehab? Oh, great.","Relax. She's completely honest, but also completely boring. Watch this. Don't tell anyone."
Of course not. Thirteen leaves. Masters looks into the Patient bay. You did an LP? Why didn't you page me?,"Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want to do one of those? You should've spoken up. You want the job or not?"
"Um, I! after careful consideration, I have decided to accept your offer for an internship.",Great. My department has a slightly different procedure log.
"Uh, you forged the last one. I only did nine LPs.",Do you know how to do an LP?
Do you know how to do an LP? Of course.,Do you know how to do nine LPs and say it was ten?
You knew he had a Parkcken? How come?,Down here! House is by the elevators. He's looking at the floor and taking baby steps. Loss of consciousness plus she's slowly turning blue. Can we rule out magical gum?
"Uh, why are you putting, um, Parkcken footprints on the floor?",That clEver bastard Wilson got a hold of an Australorp.
That clEver bastard Wilson got a hold of an Australorp. Ah.,Hello? The quietest and calmest of all the Parkckens.
But not the loss of consciousness. Cerebral vasospasm explains both.,Cerebral vasospasm makes sense.
"Um, I, um, been busy with my Patient.",You're not busy now. Standoff. She leaves. Bawwwwwwk bawk.
I handed in my log.,"On your way to do that, did you happen to stop and give Thirteen an LP? Thirteen's stiff gate, small pupils, and the raging headache she's hiding gave you away."
Yes. And I still broke a rule.,My rule. Told you to defy the Man. Not this Man.
Can we go?,No. Not liking it is fine. Not doing what you don't like makes you an eight-year-old. Wastes your potential. He sits at his computer and starts typing.
You want me to be like you. It's not going to happen.,That's the last thing I want. 'Cause then neither one of us would be exceptional.
You think I'm exceptional?,Not anymore.
I can do my job without compromising.,"No, you can't. 'Cause I'm not gonna let you. Internship's gone. It's time for Masters to say good-bye. Enjoy being a surgeon. You'll be fine."
Hypotension. Low cardiac output. Float the swan.,from the observation deck. Don't you have your own surgery?
I took a break. I told them I had to pee.,You lied. Small one. But it's a gateway lie.
I care about the Patient.,Another lie. You care about being exceptional.
I told her dad I was gonna take care of her.,A third lie. Welcome to the slippery slope.
Add that to a calcified pineal gland.,"When is a calcified pineal gland not a calcified pineal gland? I realize, technically, it's nEver, but"
Yes. But the calcified pineal could be sarcoidosis.,You had me at I had to pee.
I'm not back! I'll just be staying for this case.,You got really good at this lying thing.
"Like, literally skin you and wear you as a disguise. Oh!",You want yours extra crispy or original recipe?
I'd rather have it be with. I'm stuck.,"No, you're not."
No one will stop Kendall's sail. You need to step in.,reeling the lure back in Sign on the door says I'm a diagnostician. Cool diagnosis means I'm finished.
She could die.,casting off again Pretty sure the law of the land states that Everyone has the right to be an idiot.
"You are constantly railing against hypocrisy, forcing people to face the truth. This time nothing?",reeling the lure in Yeah. 'Cause they faced the truth.
And made a decision that will in all likelihood kill their daughter.,I'm fine with that. I wanted a diagnosis. I got it. What do you want?
I don't want her to die.,Break the rules.
Break the rules. I can't.,So coloring inside the lines is more important to you than saving this girl's life?
Depends on who you ask.,"unseen, from the hallway Fetch!"
"Dr. Masters, thank you.",Someone has got their pouty face on.
I did things no doctor in their right mind would do.,Good.
"I Manipulated, lied, forged, stole.",I don't want to know the specifics. Might be called to testify.
I broke the rules because I beliEved I was right.,You were right.
"Then why don't I feel good or satisfied? Instead, I just feel like throwing up.",And you're following me to ask how I break the rules and maintain my rosy demeanor.
I didn't do it to be happy. I just thought I would be.,"Well, you can't always get what you want. Wilson opens the door and House hands him a twenty. To the victor of the spoils. Your bird recover okay?"
House. I can't do it. I'm leaving.,Surgery?
I! don't know what I'm going to do. But I do know I don't want to be here.,Nothing will Ever be simple again.
"Are you gonna stare, or are you gonna call 911?","Partial paralysis. Head CT and LP showed nothing. Spinal MRIs and EMG were clean. Brain symptom, yet nothing seems to be wrong with his brain. He makes coffee."
He just won $42 million in the state lottery. I think I read about this lucky bastard in the paper.,You sure you don't mean the lucky bastard whose grandkids snorted his winnings till he drank himself to death with drain cleaner?
"Sure, some people will screw up anything, but some won't. That kind of cash, he has a chance to turn a miserable life around.",Miserable stays miserable. Happy doesn't buy lottery tickets in the first place.
Our lEvel of happiness is set. It's in our DNA. No cash payout's gonna change that.,It's like there's two of me.
My mother's Lawyer called. She's threatening to sue the hospital over our mistreatment of her. Says it slowed her recovery.,"You know,I was just thinking how much I want a relationship with no sex, but where I still have to deal with your mother."
"My mom and I got into a fight. Because of our replacement hip replacement, she can barely get around her own House. I told her she has to live with me while she recovers.","Oh, I'm starting to get the connection. Yeah, she has a House, my name is House."
"You're the doctor that treated her, that illegally switched her meds after she fired you, that went behind the back of her actual doctor.",Those beads from Thailand. Cuddy gives him a non-understanding look If we're listing all the things that you pressured me into.
"The point is you're the one who's on the line here, whose name is on her hospital records.",Whose name is on her name?
Treatment for both is chelation.,"Great work. Alkalinize his urine and force diuresis for heavy metal poisoning. If that doesn't work, put him on dialysis for toxic inhalation."
I just said treatment for both is chelation.,And I said force diuresis and try dialysis. You need a transcript?
"Whoa, whoa. Settle down.","If we chelate, we're not gonna know what disease he had, which means we're not gonna know if the pRoblem was in his lousy old job or his still-lousy new life."
She won't let us make a move until you agree to a sit-down with the godmother and her consigliere.,Bitch to king four.
Checkmate. Patient can't use his leg. You have to concede.,Or I could just knock all the pieces onto the floor.
"We were right that it's a brain issue, but wrong about toxic inhalation and metal poisoning. Everyone else is waiting",That was totally courageous of Khloe to Tweet about her weight gain.
Obviously I'll let you treat your Patient.,"What are you doing? We got a Patient with a walking disorder who can't seize. No, wait. I'm close, though, right?"
No clinic hours for the next quarter.,"Yeah, three Parking spots, next to each other, so I can Park diagonally, and three pairs of your underwear. I'm thinking of taking up sailing."
"Forget it. Treat your Patient, don't treat your Patient. Come to the meeting, don't come to the meeting. I'm done playing your game. She leaves.","You realize the game is automatically over when the loser loses, right?"
Neurological Lyme disease explains the seizures and the paralysis.,But not the fact that Chase seems to be treating you.
You make a good point about the antibody titers.,He's a rock. How's your brother homeless guy? Haven't heard from him in months!
"Postural hypotension, which could have reduced the blood supply to his brain.",He'd be a miserable wretch.
"Actually, the prognosis is","Oh, I'm sorry. No, I just meant his life is gonna unravel. In fairness, that applies to any diagnosis. Why do we do this?"
"His life may unravel, it may not. He's not chasing after material things.",Too bad. He might actually get those.
"And she'll nEver live up to the memory, and the thrill of finding her will wear off, and he won't Even be able to dream about being happy.",Interesting.
"The Patient may have found some long-ago nookie, but it doesn't mean he hasn't had some in the meantime. Herpes encephalitis.","Explains the neurological symptoms. EEG to confirm, I.V. acyclovir to treat. How's Foreman's BP holding?"
How's Foreman's BP holding? Same.,"That's strange, since I unplugged the lead 30 seconds ago."
"That's strange, since I unplugged the lead 30 seconds ago. Admirable effort. Foreman takes the blood pressure device off and starts to leave. House stops him. And I'm not just saying that 'cause I'm scared you might turn green and rip through your own clothes. They all leave, Thirteen the last. House blocks her way out with his cane.",Down on the Patient's roMance because your own lifespan is shorter than dinner and a movie?
You're the one who said miserable stays miserable.,You keep saying it. SEveral times a day.
I guess I could keep my motel room another night or two. They both smile at each other before she leaves the room.,Need a consult.
"Well, scan his abdomen.","Yeah, let's assume we'd already figured that out on our own, and found a mass on the pancreas. He hands the scan to Wilson, who takes a look."
Mass looks solid. I'd say it's cancer. Paraneoplastic syndrome would explain the neurological symptoms. You need to get a piece of it. Schedule a CT-guided biopsy.,"Yeah, let's assume we'd already figured that out on our own."
Then what's this consult?,Why haven't you been yelling at me about the Cuddy twins?
Because you're doing the right thing.,Are we talking about the same issue? Is there something I don't know about that I'm responding to appropriately?
"House enters loudly, carrying a surgery tray with a hip prothesis inside, which he throws on the table. House.",Ex-not-mom-in-law.
You said you weren't coming.,After you said pretty please with sugar on top?
He is being an ass. If I could join you in suing him,She's like this in bed too. Always scheming to get the Lawyers out of the room.
"If House isn't going to take this seriously, I know a few Judges who will.",Was I supposed to be the good cop?
You had to go all Wile E. Coyote on me.,You told me that Arlene wanted me in the middle of it. I had to show her that no good would come of that.
Seriously? That's your rationalization? They leave the elevator and walk to House's office. How about you didn't like that Cuddy tricked you? Even though you wanted the same thing as her. You didn't like that she got the best of you. You've got more anger toward her than you realize.,I'm happier without her. I'm not stupidly expecting her to make me happy. I'm happier with my unhappiness. Pops Vicodin.
We can't give the Patient chemo. His platelet count's through the floor.,"Even worse, it'd contain his cancers. If we want to know what they have in common, we got to see where they spread next."
You want to wait six months while the cancer spreads and his seizures and paralysis get worse?,"reasonably Well, now, that's crazy talk. But if we pump the Patient full of vascular endothelial growth factor!"
You want to grow more and bigger cancers?,"We can't figure out what three small ones have in common, maybe can figure out what eight big ones have in common?"
"Makes no difference to us, but you may want to make out a will.","Go get lotto boy's consent, and turn his cancers up to 11. They leave, except Thirteen, that House blocks again. He shows her a photograph."
"You, what, found my old yearbook, and got a picture of my high school boyfriend?","Actually, that would have been a lot simpler."
He dumped me after I hooked up with his sister.,Would you mind letting him down gently? I might have made promises you can't keep.
I need a hooker.,Not if you can make that work. Foreman gives up and sits.
How is that supposed to relax you? It's not for me. It's for Chase.,I'm saving myself too. Maybe you should get a couple.
You're riding me. Why not ride him?,Because I can get a rise out of your BP.
Because I can get a rise out of your BP. His pee-pee on the other hand! Forget yoga. Embrace Zen. You're a repressed idiot. He's a horny idiot. Neither one of you can do anything about it. Pretty sure that's Zen.,Thought we were meeting in Cuddy's office.
"HowEver much it hurt, I did have a right to break up with you.",You just want Everything to have a hidden personal agenda.
You need to get over it instead of torpedoing our jobs out of spite.,Couldn't just be that you're a pain professionally.
"Stop! You're both at fault here. You for trying to Manipulate House when you used to know better, and you for! being you, which is an especially bad idea under the circumstances.",I had good reasons.
"If I hadn't played him, he'd have found out about the meeting and crashed it anyway.",Would have been a lot more efficient.
"Enough! Okay, here's what's gonna happen. Tomorrow I drive both of you to Arlene's. You're gonna write her a personal check for $30,000, and tell her she can stay in her own home with your blessing. You're gonna do this because you actually give a crap about your job and this hospital and your mother, and possibly Even House. To House And you're gonna say, I'm sorry, and not utter one syllable more.",Because I'm an idiot?
"No, because if you don't, I'm gonna tell the pharmacy to stop issuing Vicodin prescriptions in my name.",I'm not paying for gas.
"Mom, here's a check. It's a settlement for all you've been through. Of course you can stay in your home. It was wrong of me to suggest otherwise. She slips away. Arlene smiles at House, waiting.",I'm sorry. That we saved your life. A beat. In the way that we did.
You have to lash out at Everyone who tries to help you? Live in your own kitchen sink for all I care.,"Harsh. I didn't think you had a case before, but that is no way to talk to a Patient."
"This test is what raised my blood pressure. I'm used to it now. Deep breaths, waves his arms. Go. If it's autoimmune and he created antibodies that ended up fighting his own tumors!",Growth factor would have made the underlying autoimmune condition better.
Amyloidosis? His EKG voltage has been on the low end of normal. What if the tumors were actually protein deposits?,"G.I. biopsy to confirm, chemo to treat."
She's making that diagnosis based off of low-normal EKG. Low-normal is still normal. Rising blood pressure That thing cannot be right.,"Low-normal is still low, and that thing does not have money riding on you being wrong, like the rest of us do."
"Because I took a beta blocker! Chase shows him the trick he's been hiding. Both times, right? His platelet count's still low. Chemo's still a death sentence. Treating for Amyloid with normal EKG is like doing heart surgery on a guy because he's ten pounds overweight. It's insane.","Well, we'll do it your way go shout at the Patient till he gets better. G.I. biopsy to confirm, chemo to treat. He blocks Thirteen on her way out."
I heard Cuddy quadrupled your clinic hours.,"Yeah, but you know what? I'm flying through Patients."
Arlene wants another meeting.,"I know. Told my seconds to tell her seconds that she gets no second chance. Well, technically, it's a third chance, but I don't have thirds."
"Cuddy told her the same thing, more or less.",So you got us on the same page after all.
"I've been thinking about your irrationality, and I've come up with a rational explanation for it.",That's quite a challenge.
"You don't want to let go of Cuddy, so you're clinging to the negative interaction, because some small part of you thinks the bad stuff beats nothing at all.",You're almost making this work. All you got to do now is change reality. Perhaps if I was the one suing me.
"Patient had a cardiac arrest, and his lungs and liver failed before we Even started the chemo.","Brain symptoms that aren't brain symptoms, tumors that come and go?"
It's not Amyloidosis.,"You're forgetting alopecia. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were just listing the things it's not, alphabetically."
His long-lost love is a fraud. Thirteen figured that out.,Good for her.
The truth made him miserable.,It's like there's two of me.
We'll let the court decide who's whining since you're so sure,We're not getting back together.
What are you talking about?,It's the only explanation.
"Then you're an idiot with impossible standards. Cuddy turns to House, who is not there any more.",Common enemy.
But the cancer?,Was cancer. Just growing so fast it collapsed under its own weight.
Am I gonna live?,"Cut out the teratoma, what's left of your cancer, you should be fine. Think of it as your second luckiest day."
It's hard to feel lucky. The Woman I love was a fraud.,"No, actually a fraud was a fraud. You fell for her just the same. You may stay miserable, but your long-lost love is not gonna be the reason why."
It's the real Jennifer. Or at least the only one to show up who actually has the birthmark. He's renting her an apartment.,It'll end horribly.
"Not for him. She may take all his money, and he may be a naive idiot, but! he'll always be hopeful, so he'll always be happy.",You lost your mother.
"I think if you spend your days designing Ever more effective ways to blow people up, stuff's bound to come back to you.",Thirsty. Side effect of a new antihistamine I'm on.
You don't seem congested.,"Hmm, intriguing."
You have any thoughts about our Patient?,Got some questions about whether Thirteen really beliEves in karma or just wants to.
We could ask to look through her office and we could do an MRI first.,Sure. Go ahead.
"If you're not interested in the case, why'd you take it?",I am definitely interested. Could be a tumor. Could be a CNS bleed. What do you do when you got two interesting puzzles?
Let's go. Let's go. Again wiggling his fingers for the money,Bet's off. Fight was fixed. Wilson opens his arms wide in what are you talking about? fashion. That punch barely touched him.
You bet on Foley to beat Zachary?,Speed beats power! unless speed has been paid to speedily take a dive.
"He touched him enough to put him on the canvas and the official counted him out, which means you officially owe me! 50 bucks. As soon as he says the amount, the dance starts again. Wilson is really enjoying this win.",We bet on a sporting Event. That was not sporting. Less than 30 seconds. That was barely Even Event-y.
"Okay, here's what I saw. You lost and I won.","Yeah, well, you can take that to your grave. You're not taking my 50 bucks."
"Prove it. Prove it or pay up. You got one day. And don't make me send my boys out looking for you. He turns toward the door, stops, and puts up a warning finger, which he points at various members of the team. Quietly What? All right. He leaves.","So, two puzzles. Tie goes to the one that costs me money. He grabs his cane and heads for the door. Keep each other posted."
Nope. Try to stay as still as possible. This shouldn't take long.,"Hey, how's it going?"
"You mind? I mean, there are plenty of other seats.",I'm not here to Judge. You did what was best for you and I got no pRoblem with that.
I'm not gonna ask you nice again. Just go away.,Or what?
I didn't take a dive.,Take a picture of you to prove that it was really you and we're done. Just enough to convince him. Not enough to get you in any trouble.
"slowly, enunciating clearly I didn't take a dive.","Yeah. That story's getting boring. Look, I'm not from the commission. I'm not some bookie. I'm a doctor. This is my I.D."
"Look, if you were a bookie, you'd know no one pays a guy to throw a fight he has no chance to win. I was a 12-to-1 underdog. Lost my last five fights.",But you were the better fighter. That last punch barely touched you.
"You Ever been barely touched by a guy who weighs 230 pounds? Look at me. Look where I am, what I'm wearing. Now, do I look like a guy who just got a payday? I didn't throw the fight. I just suck.",Ha! slams door Proof.
Just because he wasn't hit in the face,Look at his pupils.
"The bet was on who would win, not who would live the longest.","If he's physically unable to continue because of a preexisting illness, then it's technically a no contest, which means all bets are off."
You know that just because I was right about this one fighter doesn't make you any less of a Man?,"Actually, it would, if you were right."
"Oh, excuse me, Dr. House.","Dsol, je ne parle pas anglais. Sorry, I don't speak English."
I'm a co-worker of Wendy Lee's. I'm also her boyfriend.,Great. I'm a guy who doesn't care.
She's your Patient.,"Oh, you thought I didn't know who Wendy Lee was? Yeah, makes sense. I'm not good at names. Did Dr. Fortune tell you that?"
Her last boyfriend was a real nut. He's basically stalking her.,"See, this is what I don't care about."
stopping the elevator door from closing I think I know what's wrong with her.,You screwed up in the lab and accidentally spilled some bomb on her?
He really is crazy. Poisoned?,Apparently our mad scientist is also a slutty scientist whose milkshakes got all the nerds in the yard fighting over her.
She's a slut because she's dated two different guys at work?,"Oh, I'm sorry. I thought we were still judging her."
"Couldn't hurt to start activated charcoal, see what happens.",You know what else wouldn't hurt? This case is getting interesting. Let's add a little danger.
We start her on Valium for alcohol withdrawal. They all stop walking to look at him. It's the best we've got right now.,One normal EKG does not a healthy person make.
"Look, I told you I just suck.","Oh, you make me so sad. Don't talk like that."
turns to face House Why do you care so much?,Kill me for loving my Patients. It's just what I do.
Kill me for loving my Patients. It's just what I do.,"Hey, stop."
You don't have to be a loser. Scoffs Thanks.,"WhatEver's wrong with you, it's real."
"Could be gas in the perinephric space, in which case, we should be prepping her for emergency surgery.",What looks like Wolff-Parkinson-White but isn't?
Her EKG was normal.,"So was his. That's why I said looks like. As in similar to, but not the same."
You want us to help you get out of paying your bet while your actual Patient lies in agony.,Who's the real bad guy here?
I got it.,Your Patient? No. Plenty of time to save her life after we save my money.
"You ignore us all the time. You go on crazy joyrides all the time. But you answer pages, you sleep. House doesn't Even look at him. I know I'm gonna regret doing this, but I'll ask anyway. Is there anything I can do to help?",lifting his head Although!
lifting his head Although!,"Great news! You have an underlying neurological condition, which together with your heart"
You said my heart was fine.,"Yeah, I also said I would get you your career back."
And you save 50 bucks.,I'm a doctor.
What the hell?,Don't worry. It's just epinephrine.
Ep-is it dangerous?,"In the wrong hands, very. So! yeah, sort of. This will only take a few seconds. He checks the pulse in Foley's neck. And! you are tachycardic."
"Yo, are you psycho?",We combine the increased heart rate with chest trauma by applying a little sweet science to the science.
"Look, stop it.","Three, two, one. He waits but nothing happens. Huh. Seem to be older and more crippled than I thought. He punches Foley again."
Look no. You're embarrassing me.,Doesn't make sense. Maybe if I
You're an idiot. She's in the doorway to the living room.,How did you get in here?
My boss has me break into places all the time.,"Pain has been getting worse. I figured if I upped the Vicodin any more, I'd end up back in a rubber room, so this seemed like the smarter choice."
You're an idiot.,You drove all the way over here to break in and call me an idiot?
"No, I drove all the way over here to tell you we're implanting an automated cardio-defibrillator, which won't actually do anything to help the Patient except maybe give us enough time to come up with a guess as to what's actually wrong with her.","Oh, that makes more sense."
And I broke in here because Cuddy and Wilson both separately asked me to.,Even more logical.
"And that's not heroin, which means you knew I was coming over here, and Cuddy and Wilson are right. You're just playing a game. Throwing out a bone and watParkng us fight over it. She starts to leave in a huff.",There is another theory. He picks up a report from a table and hands it to her. Compound CS-804. It's an experimental drug that's supposed to regrow muscle.
flipping through it This experiment was done on rats.,It's groundbreaking. Huge success.
Huge success. In rats.,"Well, they got four legs. Think how fast it should work on one."
The rats are doing great.,Great is a little vague.
"Even better than the previous study. 12% increase in strength, 22% in flexibility, and some improvement in at least 60% of the subjects.",Have you done maximum tolerated dose studies?
"Not yet. But that's part of the beauty. Since the compound is easily excreted in urine, as long as they keep hydrated, there's really no reason to expect any danger at virtually any dose. I mean, obviously you can't know for sure.","But if it's worthy of the preface obviously, then obviously it only needs to be explained to idiots."
You all right?,Leg hurts. Would you mind getting me a coffee?
How does coffee help your leg?,It will prEvent me from walking to get the coffee.
loudly through the closed door Experimental drugs?,"opening the door That's unfair. 'Cause at one point, Even Vicodin was an experimental drug. I have to go."
"Well, unless you're going to do your job, it can wait.",I'm going to do my job.
I'll give you a lift.,turning back into the living room I'll give you two minutes.
Hmm. Why are you off them?,Because they don't work.
Why were you on them?,Because they come in banana flavor. You know the answer.
You think fixing your leg will fix your life.,"I think that my life will be somewhat better if part of my life, specifically my leg, is somewhat better."
You think all your pRoblems are your leg.,"And you're here to tell me that no matter how depressed I may be, it's not enough."
"I think you want Everything to be physical, tangible, simple. You want unhappiness to have a cure. House picks up his jacket which he had put on the couch. House, you obviously","standing and walking past Wilson I hate that word. I have to go now. Actually, I don't, but it would be rude to walk out without saying anything."
Excuse me. We have to go.,leaning out the window You need a drink.
leaning out the window You need a drink. I'm fine.,That wasn't a question. You really do need a drink.
"I drink any more, I'm gonna explode.",You're not going to explode.
How Many bottles is this supposed to take?,Six.
And I've drank how Many?,looking in the trunk Eight. It's not an exact science.
"So in other words, nothing's gonna prove you wrong. You're just gonna keep making me miserable because you're too miserable",You're an idiot.
You were wrong. It's not the end of the world.,Anything else you want to say?
after a pause and a deep breath You have a pRoblem. I think if you seriously look at Everything that,Anything else?
"Okay, look, this isn'tHouse raises his cane and turns toward the Ordinary People poster. Wilson jumps up to stop him. Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay! House stands back but keeps his cane ready. He looks pissed. No! I don't. He gestures locking his mouth and throwing away the key. Just get out of here. Go home. We'll talk later. Someplace without any of my stuff.",Nothing to talk about. That was my point.
Shut up. You're drunk.,"Well, whose fault is that? Give me another scotch."
I can't serve you.,"This 'cause I'm black? 'Cause I'm not, so!"
"Come on, buddy.","Look, you can't get me drunk and then give me crap for being drunk."
Don't be a jerk.,Is it the company of stout-hearted men?
Just get the moron a drink so he'll shut the hell up.,No.
I'm giving you your drink.,Have you no pride? Either serving me is a good idea or it's a bad idea. Shutting me up is a crappy reason for compromising what you beliEve.
Not Even an effective one apparently.,Am I gonna have to hit him?
Not a good idea.,But what if it's the right thing to do?
Sit down. I'm not gonna hit you.,"Just as well, 'cause I was lying."
What are you doing here?,Training for my big fight. Just need you to
"Drink five more bottles? Get punched a few more times? Look, just get out and give up.",That's your specialty.
"Scoffs Ooh, looks like you already lost your big fight. House takes down his cane. As Foley passes, House presses the bottom of the cane to the base of Foley's neck. Foley turns around, angry. Look, I may not be able to take a punch, but I can still throw one.","Three, two! Foley starts to demonstrate but falls over, unconscious. What a lovely day."
He had a security clearance.,"Ahem! Wilson looks up. What's this? House enters A palm. Hmm, useful for Many things. Slapping, greasing, pRobably some other applications too. Right now it's ready for $50 and humiliation."
He was actually sick?,He wasn't knocked out by the punch.
Wow. Fascinating. Completely explains exactly how he lost.,"Oh, you are not gonna be like that, 'cause you got a lot more posters here."
"No, I'm not. Well done, House. You might have saved that guy. Given him his life back.","Oh, no. He needs surgery. He's nEver gonna fight again."
What happened to your eye? You okay?,Better than okay.
"Promise me, you won't take me to the hospital. I promise.",Look at how much fun she's having.
"That's because he has two functioning legs, capable of supporting her body weight.",So do I.
You told me most of your muscle was cut out.,I was going for the sympathy discount. Been taking some experimental medicine.
"Yeah, I got a lot of clients on experimental medicine.",You want proof?
You want proof?,"Okay, this amp stack weighs way more than you do."
"Okay, this amp stack weighs way more than you do.","See? Now, Even if those implants were made of adaMantium, I'd still be able to!"
"See? Now, Even if those implants were made of adaMantium, I'd still be able to!",Sorry. Cramp.
Cramp. I'm sure.,sighing I'm not gonna be needing your services tonight after all.
"I have a leak in my bathroom, and my guy won't come take a look at it till tomorrow morning, and an emergency plumber's 200 bucks an hour. Dr. House.",Dr. Riggin. Figures you'd be wrapping up the trial by now. I just wanted to give you a hearty mazel tov.
And don't forget the Nobel Prize for dEveloping an incredibly expensive rat poison.,What do you mean? What happened?
Just look at these things.,Any indication the rats were getting sick?
I came here because you're a doctor! not a shrink.,Ugh!
not a shrink. Ugh!,Ah! Ugh! Ugh!
"Sweetie! go wait for mommy by the couch, okay? Go on. Rachel obeys",I tried calling Everyone else. You were the last one on the list.
Any reason why 911 wasn't on the list?,It's not an emergency.
Right. She kneels on the floor next to the tub Are you suicidal?,gasping I'm not attempting bypass surgery. The tumors are small and they're close to the surface. I thought it'd be like! removing a wart.
You couldn't wait till morning bring your CT scans to an actual surgeon?,Surgeons are idiots. They'd just hack away at the muscle until they get worn out.
Or you're just ashamed you've been injecting a drug that hasn't Even gone through safety trials. It's nEver Even been in the huMan body.,I got one of the tumors. The second one is close. nodding to the scan on the wall You can use the CT to help you find the third.
getting up off the floor I'm taking you to the hospital.,pleading Justjust excise the tumor.
What happened to your leg?,I was trying to make it better.
"He was being reckless. Sit back, Honey. to House This isn't about making your leg better. It's about making your life better.",Here we go. Wish I had called 911.
Why else would you risk your life doing something so stupid?,"Well, you know, I've had a lot of setbacks lately."
Darrien? Darrien! to Chase She lost consciousness.,There are no cars coming. Just go.
Stop with the pirate talk.,"imitating the pirate Brownbeard from the cartoon If you don't want Brownbeard to end up with two wooden legs, better get yer ma to move this ship, you Mangy bilge"
nodding Of course! You showed her that filthy cartoon. What kind of idiot lets a three-year-old watch that?,"If you want to lecture me on my poor judgment, there would seem to be more relevant examples."
Your heart rate's over 120. You're clammy. I think you're going into shock. Are you lightheaded?,I'm fine.
Are you lightheaded? I'm fine.,to Rachel Did you see the new Brownbeard episode?
It was so funny.,"No, it was so lame. Got a boat full of guy pirates and they make the girl pirate walk the plank."
Got a boat full of guy pirates and they make the girl pirate walk the plank. She floated.,That's 'cause she had big boobies. That's why he should have kept her.
"We've got to get you into surgery. Where is that nurse? Rachel, let's go find the nurse.",200 a.m. Nice of you to call me back.
talking to House on the phone Chase and I are in the hospital with a Patient.,You've completely run out of ideas and you're calling me to bail you out. I'm touched. Hit me.
Would you like to call Ruby on mobile? No.,She on any medication! besides crack?
"She was taking Interferon in prison, so I'm guessing she's had Hep-C for at least ten years.",Can I guess stuff too? 'Cause that's gonna make the diagnosis really easy.
And we can't exactly ask the Patient.,"Yeah, that would have been pre-coma. But how could you have known that it would affect her that way?"
We didn't think we had anything mysterious until,How about renal cancer throwing clots?
Urinalysis was negative.,That's too bad. 'Cause that was my one big idea.
"House? House, you there?",Tell me more about the Patient. What was she doing before prison?
"She was a cop. Shot a kid in self defense, nEver got over the guilt, started taking drugs, and got busted.",Way to bury the lead. How long ago was the shooting?
I'm not sure. Why?,"Again, you assumed she's had Hep-C for ten years."
And you think this is relevant?,"It's more relevant than what you got now, which is squat."
"It's more relevant than what you got now, which is squat.",Three Parkcks just came into my bedroom. I got to go. He disconnects
They're ready for you.,Wait. I want you in there.
I'm not a surgeon. There's nothing I can do.,"Well, you can make sure that! idiot butcher doesn't cut more than he needs to."
You already signed a release. He's gonna do what he needs to do.,"Yeah, and if that involves chopping off my leg! I want to be sure that that's damn well necessary. He sighs"
He sighs House!,I don't trust him. I trust you.
sitting in an easy chair beside the bed You're lucky.,What are you doing here?
You hoping for someone else?,"Hot nurse, candy striper! Someone who doesn't speak English. Someone who doesn't speak judgmental."
"reading the letter I hope your leg feels better and I hope we can be friends again soon, you bloody scallywag.",I have to pee.
That's a good sign.,throwing back the blankets I'm a big boy.
You're an ass.,"What, for trying to walk on a freshly Mangled leg?"
Come on. Listen to me. You can't keep going like this. Something has to change.,Can I pee first?
Can I pee first?,I know.
That's what they're there for.,Hey. We were just getting to the good part.
"That's Afsoun Hamidi. She's a genius. She just won the MacArthur, legally proving it. Just had a retrospective at the Tate Modern. Nobody reads The New Yorker?",Nope. But I subscribe to her Patient file.
"House, you should relax. You had surgery this morning.","Minor surgery, removing a drain."
Put there during major surgery.,My doctor says it's okay as long as I don't leave my hospital bed.
Which doctor was that Seuss or J?,Nurse.
I'm surprised he approved it. I'm more surprised you actually asked.,I do things like that now. I'm making some changes! like skipping ahead to minute 37.
I'm not gonna watch a Woman get set on fire.,Philistine.
Who's the guy with the notebook who can't decide what to do?,Her assistant.
One Man's crazy is another Woman's art. Her work explores things like gender politics and self-image.,And the pressing issue of shaving your entire body in public while wearing a monkey mask. He pulls up a picture of that from an on-line article.
I still vote for nuts. We should run a resting-state functional MRI to look for increased activity in the dorsal nexus.,She's not nuts.
The monkey-mask-shaving medium really speaks to you?,What speaks to me is she's elevated being full of crap to a genuine art form and made a fortune doing it.
There was a space heater next to her in the gallery.,pulling up the picture of Afsoun lying on the floor Carbon monoxide poisoning. It fits. Put her in a hyperbaric chAmber.
"Oh, thank God. The I.C.U. isn't being attacked by giant radioactive spiders.",Did I text you that?
"My sweater, a coffee mug, a half-used bottle of lotion, and a DVD of Marley Me.","Given your thing for Owen Wilson, I thought you might want those last two back asap."
I don't get it.,You masturbate to Owen Wilson.
I meant the box.,Oh.
I haven't Even spoken to you since you hurt yourself.,I was self-destructive. It won't happen again. I'm making changes. I'm gonna stop doing stupid things.
Great. The smart thing to do would be to talk about why you did it. If you don't understand,I think I could avoid putting another hole in my leg without talking about my mother.
"Well, I don't want to find out you're wrong by getting another phone call from you in a bloody bathtub.","I'm a big beliEver that the best way to get past the past is to shoot it in the head, bury it in a deep pit, and pour lye on"
sitting on the foot of the bed I'm just asking you to talk about it. You owe me. He looks suspicious. Forget about saving your life. You exposed my daughter to that obnoxious pirate cartoon.,"Bring me lunch tomorrow, and we can plumb my depths."
"You think that's a symptom? He's in love with her. He was pRobably overwhelmed, couldn't decide what to do.",What's he been doing since she was admitted? Did he bring anything from the Patient room to the treatment room?
"A few things a handbag, flowers, stuffed elephant.",Does she seem like the kind of Woman who needs a stuffed animal?
"Who are you calling? Her phone rings. Oh, of course.","flirtatious, sleazy What are you wearing? fake duh expression Oh, I can see what you're wearing. Go to her room."
"flirtatious, sleazy What are you wearing? fake duh expression Oh, I can see what you're wearing. Go to her room.",voice on the phone Now go address the elephant in the room.
This is a Nanny Cam.,voice on the phone The reason Luca couldn't decide what to do in the treatment room is the same as in the gallery.
Why are we Even discussing this case? She lied to us. It's opening us up to malpractice.,Our practice opens us up to malpractice.
How do we know she's actually sick?,Her being sick is a clue.
She would have let him set her on fire because of the honesty of her work. Faking an illness doesn't fit.,"Thirteen's right at least her conclusion was. Everything else was laughably wrong. If the Patient induced pancreatitis and a heart attack, she'd be suicidal."
Exactly. She's risking her life all the time.,Exactly.
Fine. I'll get the C.T.,Sure. I'd be happy to come with you. Thanks for asking.
You're supposed to stay in bed doctor's orders.,"If you really cared about me, you wouldn't be so obvious when you scheme to prove me wrong."
"If you really cared about me, you wouldn't be so obvious when you scheme to prove me wrong. You volunteered because you want to C.T. her lungs, not her biliary tree. You want to find fibrosis and prove your paint thinner theory. If I don't come with, when you fail, you'll pretend you nEver tried. I don't really have a choice, now, do I?","Since I've seen your paycheck, I pRobably shouldn't."
"Pale, diaphoretic, tachycardic, B.P., 80 over 40. Internal bleeding?",Get her out of here and scope her.
You stood me up.,Sorry. Should have scheduled my Patient's internal bleeding for Thursday.
"You're still playing the same petty, passive-aggressive games.","Got you to go all the way to the second floor of a building you work in. Boy, did I screw with you."
You said you were going to change.,Check the sign. It says you got to treat me with intensive care.
"I'm expressing my anger. You should try it. Right now, let's finally have our fight.",All we do is fight.
"No, all you've done is pull pranks or have temper tantrums with Wilson, nEver me, marry mail-order prostitutes, make me go to your wedding",Dominika is a licensed aesthetician.
You cut open your own leg.,So all this was about you?
"You don't think it was Even related? House, we've nEver Even had a conversation about our breakup. You are obviously still angry at me. And it's hurting both of us.","Wow, I hadn't realized the incredible healing power of lunch."
calmly It wasn't working.,"Lunch at 100, tomorrow in the cafeteria. You happy?"
How Many of those have you had today?,I don't know. Is your mother a number?
The Patient is a fraud. I found a puncture in the dorsal vein of her left foot.,Shooting up heroin wouldn't explain
"Not heroin. She was injecting herself with her own red blood cells. It caused her heart issues, and when her hematocrit Evened out, we mistook it for internal bleeding.",It must have been a very distinctively shaped and awfully talkative puncture for you to get all of that.
Browser history on her laptop helped. He hands House a file folder. She was researParkng blood doping among other things.,She was researParkng me?
"Knowing him, he'll be in a bar. He'll find one that matches how he feels inside. It'll be the most dark, depressing hole you can find in New Jersey.",Now you're just pissing me off.
I'm really sorry. I-I didn't know she researched you. I had no idea she,"If you don't know anything, then why are you talking?"
Please don't take it out on Luca.,I'll take it out on whoEver I think will irritate you the most.
I thought you would understand someone who uses their work to deal with pain.,I didn't realize that search engines could look within the soul.
You're standing in front of me in a hospital gown.,What the hell was the point of this? What personal trauma are you exploiting. I'm! sorry mining for its artistic potential?
Wait. You're really sick?,Why me?
"If I do, there won't be any game for him, and then there won't be any art for us.",annoyed Why me?
I don't answer those questions.,"You know, there's a lot of games I could play that don't involve dealing with narcissistic, Manipulative poseurs."
"But this is a puzzle tailor-made for you. You don't know which of my symptoms are real, which are fake, which ones I'm not Even telling you about. I know that intrigues you. Do you really want to end it now?",quietly No.
You want us to waste a bed on her?,You took an oath! an oath to be cool. At least that was the one I mumbled under my breath while Everyone else was doing the boring one.
"Even if she is sick, which I don't beliEve, she also says she has a diagnosis. So it's either just a lie, or it's just a game.",So what? I like the game. It's fun. Go get a blood culture. Check for parasites and bacteria.
"This is the new House half the leg power, twice the irresponsibility?",The new House is about making my life healthier. NEver said anything about yours. Go get her blood.
"I'll do it. He's going through a tough patch right now. If this is the distraction he needs to keep him in his hospital bed, I'm sure it's better than any of the alternatives. she leaves",That was incredibly condescending. Did it work?
"That pancreatic cyst we drained it's back, and she doesn't care at all.",You think she actually is suicidal.
"I would, but how did she give herself the cysts? Tox screen was negative, and there's no sign of trauma.",reaParkng for his laptop There is another explanation.
What are we doing here?,Testing a theory.
That was a commentary on society's,"It was a commentary on the fact that it was gonna fall out anyway, and she wanted to hide why."
Cancer? Areare you sure about that?,See that tumor-ish thingamajig near her brainamabob?
"almost inaudibly Oh, God.",Are you getting this? Game's over. I won. Primary CNS lymphoma with associated paraneoplastic syndrome.
"Luca, my mind was not clear then.",And then you cleared it.
"If that was what I thought, I don't any longer. You spent time with me. You took this personally.","No, I didn't."
You're forging my name on prescriptions again.,No. Wilson waits. What you just said implies that I stopped at some point.
"20 minutes ago, I put a notice out to all local pharmacies to require verbal authorization before filling my prescriptions.",You have any idea how much extra work you've just given yourself? You're not gonna last a week.
"I've been dealing with this for years. But it's over your liver, your hearing, nEver mind the fact that each scrip you write is a separate felony. You will serve time, so could I.",You've chosen this moment to give me crap about my Vicodin use?
picking up a pill bottle from the bed table You filled this three days ago. Now it's almost half gone.,So is my leg.
It's a month supply. The amount you're taking has nothing to do with physical pain.,"Okay. So maybe I am trying to numb myself a little, because I'm trying to change, trying to stop being self-destructive."
So you can only handle not self-destructing by being self-destructive?,What do you want from me?
"I don't know, House, but I'm worried about you. I don't know how Many times I can watch you cut off pieces of yourself. Now it's the I.C.U. Next time it'll be the morgue. You're miserable. And you're angry. And I want you to actually deal with that and not just try to mediCate the issue away.",No. You know what I feel right now? I don't feel miserable or angry. I don't feel good or bad. I feel! nothing! which feels great.
What are you doing?,"Moving on. In the direction of my House, where I got some more pills."
"If you're discharging yourself against doctor's orders, you've got to check that box.","I'm a doctor. So, technically"
Wouldn't it be easier if you just checked the box?,Why are you still here?
Does this mean something?,It's not eczema. And it's not cancer.
Radiation? On my brain? But it made me fuzzy last time. It was harder to work. I am still slowed down from it.,"And it'll get worse. But, you know, dying can also do a number on your ability to think."
"I can't watch you die! not when you can save yourself. he kisses her brown Good-bye, Afsoun.",Good for you.
Good for you.,So.
"So. Why did I Ever ban alcohol from the cafeteria? Before I forget, there's a brush. Tortoise-shell handle, natural bristles wasn't in the box. If you could look for it!",Like the Lindbergh baby. You dating anyone?
We don't have to,"Look, it's just standard lunch conversation."
Not for us.,"Okay, well, if you've gone over to the we don't talk about things side, then I've got a pot roast in the oven. checks his watch"
No. I haven't dated anyone since you.,"Well, you know what they say once you go gimp!"
We s-should talk about your leg.,"rubbing his face You think I have unresolved issues, and you are the unresolved issues."
"Yes. But it'sit's I think it's more than that. It's your life, your choices.",I did it to fix my life.
House! talk to me!,I already did.
"No, you just parroted back what Wilson and I've been saying to you the last few days.",Get out of my way.
"No. She looks down and touches his leg. Oh, you pulled a stitch. House, please just talk to me.","loud You want to know how I feel? two deep breaths then, quietly I feel hurt."
I know. I'm sorry.,It's not your fault.
I! didn't expect that.,Sorry. Just checking the stitches on my penis. pulls his jeans up.
Your leg okay?,It's healing.
Good. Just came to grab the radiation-therapy forms.,What?
Afsoun changed her mind.,to Luca Get out. He leaves and he turns to her. You made a decision.
I changed my mind.,Why?
Because there are more important things than,"Than what than your brain, your abilities? It's where Everything comes from any meaning in your life, any happiness."
Not all happiness,He's already left once.
You alright? You go to lunch with Cuddy?,Yeah.
How was it?,The pasta Arrabbiata was cold.
Why don't we get a drink? We could go to the Sawmill.,Cuddy's is on the way. I need to return this.
You think she's going to have an emergency tangle?,It was on my mind. I want to get it off.
Want me to come?,If I get in trouble? I'm delivering a hair brush.
What just happened?,Get out.
What just happened?,enunciating Get out.
You'll feel better. Aah!,cheerfully You're right. I feel much better.
You want another one?,"No, I think I've had enough. What do you think I should do today?"
I don't know. hopefully Go home?,Not tonight. Cheers.
Not tonight. Cheers.,Pericardial effusion.

Yes. Yes?,"Well, that's the correct answer, isn't it?"
Are you trying to annoy us?,"No, I'm just trying to give you the answers you need to cover your asses, fill out your forms, and let me out of here."
We need you to show us remorse.,Is that how our system works? Release the best actors? I shudder to think what that world would be like.
You drove your car into your ex-girlfriend's House and then fled the country for three months.,"I knew that her daughter was at grandma's, like Every Friday, and I saw Everyone else move into the living room."
They could've moved back.,Which I would've noticed since I was driving right towards them. He just can't stop himself from being a smart ass.

I didn't say it was.,"Not out loud, but you're figuring that joint pain, plus fEver, plus a low lifestyle equals a ceftriaxone prescription."

"Well, there's no discoid or malar rash on his face.",Which would be dispositive if he was just a giant head.

Y-you're missing my point.,I'm not gonna listen to a guy who can't name the reindeer.

"Yeah. He puts down his sketch pad and takes off his shirt. House looks at the picture then starts inspecting Nick's torso. That's Nicole. She lives at her mom's now on account that she lost her job.

I checked you out. You were a pretty big deal. What went wrong?,Something very obvious and very boring.
Drug related? Forging prescriptions?,"Oh, you're good, just like lupus boy will be when you start him on prednisone. Name should've been a giveaway. I'll send him up."
Why are you so sure I'm gonna do what you say?,"Because you're a smart, old-money, trust-fund girl who took this job because your liberal ideology makes you wanna make a difference, but you're already getting bored, and this is interesting."
Why would you say any of that?,"Your shoes different, expensive pair Every day, but nEver leather, which means you're both rich and liberal."

No. Asofa's lowers his arm. The cricket is cupped in his massive hand. It's not moving. Fix him.,It's not lupus. He broke his arm.
"Or it is lupus, and he was in a fight.",He was in a jostle.
"'Cause if he admits he was in a fight, then he goes to the hole.",That's why he'd lie to the guards. He's got no reason to lie to me.
straightening up and thinking about this Huh.,See?
May you what? Make me lose my job by showing you a Patient file? House drops his hand and looks down. But why don't you assume no recent meds?,How long can I assume that he's been smoking? Based on his yellow fingers.
You're thinking lung cancer. Metastatic. I'll x-ray him on Friday. House gives her an annoyed look. We share a traveling x-ray maParkne with two other clinics.,I'm out of here on Friday.
I'm out of here on Friday. He's not.,"Well, how about! if he throws a clot and strokes out, you can use the x-ray to do the autopsy. Start him on blood thinners."
Very interesting practice you must've run. No need for tests. House taps on the door and the guard opens it. No need for proof. Where are you going?,leaving To the proof store.
You were right about Nicole.,"lifts his head About me not caring? I thought so. He goes back to listening, tapping on Nick's chest with a couple of fingers."

Hear the difference? impressed Yeah!,It's called an acoustical shadow. It means he's got a tumor.
How did you find that without a stethoscope? I didn't Even know you could do this!,Start the blood thinners.
So I for sure got lung cancer? No.,simultaneously Yeah
All you've proven is there's an anomaly in his chest.,incredulous Which means your initial diagnosis could still be right?
Which apparently really bugs you. She has an idea I could do a clotting test.,That's! that's a good idea.
"Are you really leaving medicine? What are you gonna do? no answer You know, for someone who asks as Many favors as you do, you sure don't make any effort to win me over.","Before I went to med school, I thought about getting a Ph.D."

And completely divorced from huManity.,"Well, me and huManity, we got together too young."
Tsk. You have a gift. There is something in this world you are undeniably great at. You can read people. You-you understand them. You gotta go back to medicine.,"Well, if that gift is related to what brought me here, you'll understand if I wanna check the returns policy."
Is this supposed to happen? Cool.,Jiminy didn't Parkrp much last night.
"Jiminy didn't Parkrp much last night. If it's a disease, then he's six inches under. He taps some bicarb into the bottle. But this could also be pesticide poisoning! He shakes the bottle well Which bicarbonate of soda has been used to treat. He adds some to a postcard which he picks up and, blocking the view with his body, slips under an upturned half bottle with the new cricket in it. He steps to the side so Asofa can see the cured cricket. See? Just so much and no more.",Mm! silence This is where you say thank you. nothing Or I say thank you for not killing me. long pause Thank you.
Hey. The x-ray didn't show any tumors. The acoustical shadow was just a lipoma. House sits down and rubs his leg. I'm thinking you all right?,I'm fine.
I'm fine. Ibuprofen?,It's not gonna help.
You can look at the Patient file if you want.,You trust me?
Any reason I shouldn't?,"You're really not good at reading people, are you? Or buildings."

Why did you lie to me about what you were in for?,"enters and closes the door behind him Okay, so I drove a car into a wall instead of stealing some pills."
I feel stupid. It-it doesn't Even make sense. Why are you doing time? You didn't have any priors. You didn't hurt anyone.,I had a bad Lawyer.

Saving us both from contraband charges. It was great knowing you. He knocks on his cell door. A guard arrives. House talks to him through the locked door. I need to be taken into protective custody.,Wow. The guard accompanying him waits imPatiently. That was great. I think I really dodged a bullet there.
You don't need P.C.?,"walking away, toward his cell Uh, it's nothing personal. We'll reschedule. Rain check, I promise."
"walking away, toward his cell Uh, it's nothing personal. We'll reschedule. Rain check, I promise.","It wasn't the food. It was the heat. It's mastocytosis. It can be set off by hot liquids, like the coffee he just drank."
It's a possibility. I'll run some blood tests. Thank you.,"No, no! It's almost impossible to confirm masto with blood work. Just give him five aspirin. Adams looks very puzzled."
"If he has masto, he'll go into anaphylactic shock and won't be able to breathe again.",You do understand the meaning of the word confirm.
But if-if it is masto It's not.,"Well, what do you have to lose by giving him the aspirin?"
I'm not taking the risk.,It's his risk to take.
I think House is right. No.,"quietly, choosing his words carefully You're a moron and a coward. I'll do it myself."
"Dr. House. Did you get all the Vicodin you needed? he looks at her I'm not an idiot. That fire, the bruise on your face! I talk to prisoners. I know about exit taxes. You're clearly getting squeezed.",I need 20. She pulls a bottle of pills out of her pocket and gives him some. And let me back into the clinic when Sykes is gone.

"I checked your file. You didn't have a bad Lawyer. You had no Lawyer. You took the first deal they offered you, because you wanted to punish yourself. Do you think getting beaten up, you think saving this one guy will wipe your slate clean?",No.
Then why are you doing this?,"'Cause I have a gift. to Nick Once you drink this, you should get an attack almost immediately. That is, if I'm right."
You just bought yourself months in solitary. Was it really worth it?,"If I'm wrong, no, it wasn't."

Springing you was Foreman's idea. I wasn't convinced until Simpson failed three times.,It amounts to the same thing. You wanted me back.
"See, I knew you'd over-interpret it.","Strong, emotional reaction. I guess that's what a lifetime membership gets you. How's your wrist?"

Paraneoplastic syndrome's out. The lung donor didn't have cancer.,Tell that to the tumor that I found in his arm.
That mass wasn't a tumor. It was coagulated plasma. E.R. pumped him full of it. I.V. leaked into his arm. I Even did a complete MRI. No cancer anywhere. We've got nothing.,Just 'cause it wasn't a tumor doesn't mean it didn't mess with the lungs. They're reacting to something in the plasma.
But Every unit of plasma can have up to 25 contributing donors. We need to track down all of them.,Still.
No. You can't leave the hospital.,25 donors contributed to the plasma that the lung donor got. My team cannot track down and interview them all in six hours.

Nice. What?,Nothing.
Don't start that.,Start what? I'm enjoying our conversation. The repartee.
There was no repartee.,That was repartee.
I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it to help my Patient.,It's just good to hear your voice.
It's just good to hear your voice. disconnecting Goodbye.,That's my whiteboard. I need it. And he really doesn't care how the cast comes off.
smiling Dr. Foreman warned us that you'd try something. Told me to call him if you did. I'd like to do that.,I'll take this outside.
I'll take this outside.,answering the phone Yeah.

Yeah. Alcohol.,He'd have to be pretty drunk for it to affect a pool of plasma.
"These guys have got that covered. Acute etoh ingestion could haveshe interrupts the call to yell at the painting crew hey, paint around them, they're not hurting anyone",Who's painting?
"The crew's just starting. Paint fumes didn't cause contamination. But, maybe the old paint did. They scraped off the underpass, pRobably because it contains! lead.",speaking it at the same time as Park does Lead.
still standing How's the chelation going?,REverend Moon started it about 20 minutes ago. You missed lunch tracking down the plasma donors. Got you a Reuben from the cafeteria.
Thanks. he sits Lead exposure's a nice diagnosis. I hope it pays off.,It will.
"I appreciate your confidence, but she's not really","Oh, no, she could die. But technically it will still pay off. Even if your Patient dies, someone will get the lungs."
We killed part of the lung.,into the phone Page Dr. Pinto stat to the cath lab.
We're going to the cath lab? Are you thinking that maybe,What? Who? One dead lobe means four alive ones. It means enough to transplant with a side order of dead tissue that we can test.
It makes sense. Unlike you stealing my phone.,"You have unlimited texting. Until your parents know, you will nEver see that punch for what it really was. Your February 4th. Sri Lankan Independence Day."
I told you I'm Korean and Filipino.,And I told you I wasn't listening. By my actions.
Violence isn't an appropriate way to handle conflict. It was a moment of weakness.,"You barked at me, picked a fight with a painting crew. Maybe it's time to recognize it's not a character flaw. Maybe it's your character."

to Park Embrace your inner bitch.,So why did chelation make the lungs worse?
So why did chelation make the lungs worse?,We got about five minutes till Pinto gets back. Give me a hand with this.
I tracked down another bag of plasma from the batch they used on the donor. Negative for all our other exposures.,"Sarcoidosis could be inflamed by the treatment. He looks at the chair then back at Park I am a cripple, in need of assistance."
"ignoring House, Park opens the Patient file Um, transplant team ran an A.C.E. Negative.",It's mine. And it's your job.
My job is to assist you in curing the lungs.,This chair will help me do that.
What if the scrapings from the bridge contained other heavy metals like barilium or asbestos?,Chelation for lead wouldn't have made them worse.
Chelation for lead wouldn't have made them worse.,But! maybe the pRoblem isn't a heavy metal from outside. It's inside. But it's not leaving the body like it's supposed to. It's stuck. Iron. The donor had hemosiderosis.
His body wasn't disposing of iron. Massive amounts choke up the lungs. Then our chelation would wreak havoc because it picks up too much stuff.,Go stain the dead lung tissue for iron.
Go stain the dead lung tissue for iron.,"I'm sorry, young lady, I simply will not help you steal this chair."
"I'm sorry, young lady, I simply will not help you steal this chair.",Pinto.

"Ah, explains the hole in this chair.","God, I missed doors. And air freshener."
"God, I missed doors. And air freshener.",Now go away. I'm waiting for some test results.
My Patient signed a DNR. She's giving up. Looks like someone else will be getting the lungs. Making this yet another interaction with you in which I get nothing.,It's not my fault you can't handle your Patient.
"She said she's done. I spent half an hour trying to change her mind, but she'd made her decision. I accepted that. It's called respect.",And what's after respect?
"Biopsy rEvealed, white blood cell inflitrates.","Infection was right, after all."
"Infection was right, after all.",Fresh fruit in prison is usually Parkcken.
Why aren't you more alarmed? We're running out of time.,"yelling Aahh, she's dying! speaking normally again Were you able to figure out what was wrong while I was screaming?"
Infection was the first thing that the transplant team treated for.,Which would have worked if the bacteria had been out in the open.

"They're part of the immune defense force, like the infantry. But those lungs need the Air Force and the Marines, antibodies raining down from above. Park still does not understand",explaining Antibiotics and IVIG.
Did you use metaphors for your old team? Or do you just think I'm particularly stupid?,"No, they were stupid too."
to Vanessa Hey beautiful. Hi.,lifting his head to look at Wilson Case is under control. It's me time.
Vanessa's gonna do the lung slurry. House props himself up on his elbows and looks at Wilson You were right to push me. I needed that. Thank you.,So we're good?
"It was good advice. Just, came here to say thank you.",I like you.
"The thing is, House! I don't like you. He leaves",When did the discoloration start?
A few minutes after I started the IVIG.,Means we're wrong about infection.
"And by we, you mean you. You screwed up the lungs.","Wrong about autoimmune, not cancer, heavy metals, genetic issues! Increase peep."
Already maxed out. We're close to the point of no return. The lungs will nEver be viable for transplant.,I need! I need ideas.
I need ideas. IgA nephropathy.,That's already ruled out.
That's already ruled out. Lupus.,frustrated No--o.
Maybe we're just out of time.,We're out of time when we're out of time. When they die or she dies. Keep them stable as long as you can. I need to think. He leaves
Make a wish. Make a wish.,The lungs are a smoker. speaking to the lungs You of all people should know better.

"Eosiniphilic pneumonitis. But, the steroids would have treated for that.","I was right. Not about anything medical, but my metaphors were perfect. We need to hit it harder. We need to carpet bomb, blitzkrieg. We need the nuclear option."
"At some point you're going to say we need to radiate, right?","See, the metaphors work."
But that'll destroy the good lung too. Better to go with a strong cocktail of immunosuppressants.,Won't be fast enough. Wilson needs these lungs.
This is all you get. Ortho still has the outer office.,"Well, that sucks. Where are Chase, Taub, and Thirteen gonna sit?"
"You're welcome, House.",Oof!
Dinner later? I'll pick something up.,still lying on the floor and rubbing his jaw I heard about a good new vegetarian place.
Why am I watParkng you cut your hair?,"If I do it at home, I'm the one who has to clean it up."
I was referring less to where it's happening and more to why.,"New life, new look."
Does that mean you like your new life?,"If you're asking if your job is safe, that depends on what you have to say about the file you're holding."
"It doesn't seem like much of a case. Although, I'm sure I'm wrong!",You are. Tell me why.
"Guy collapsed after being on his feet for hours on a hot day without breakfast, so! that's really weird.","E.R. found nothing wrong, then I decided I should test his wallet."
He's rich? That's why we're taking the case?,"No, we're taking the case because no one knows what's wrong with him. And he's rich."
"No, we're taking the case because no one knows what's wrong with him. And he's rich.",Dr. Adams. To Park Give her the file.
This is my only copy.,"My M.O. depends upon the use of a team. Definitionally, that involves! more than one person. So I really have no choice. Give her the file."
You can't afford a team.,"Adams is free. And I'm referring both to her availability and her price tag Adams gives him a look. New girl, meet newer girl, and vice versa."
You said we were meeting for coffee.,"Well, when someone asks if you want coffee, they obviously don't just mean coffee."
I thought you were referring to talking.,"Talking about medicine. Specifically, as it refers to the guy whose name is on the file she still hasn't handed you."
"I'm not working, House. I'm in the process of looking for a paying job.","In the meantime, there's no way a do-gooder like you has been volunteering all over town ladling kittens, spaying soup!"
There is a free clinic in Trenton.,"Well, think of this as today's free clinic. Only with fewer bums with herpes."
I don't think we actually have much of a case. I think it's just dehydration.,What happened the last time another doctor told you I was wrong about a case?
I lost my job.,You saved a life.
Most people with his kind of money are commissioning oil paintings of their Yorkshire terrier. Benjamin is sacrificing his own comfort to help others.,That's because helping others is his Yorkie oil painting.
"That's naive and sick. You really want to improve things? You do it through policy. This guy empties his pockets, what really changes?","That's right, all those babies with AIDS, they're just using us."
"My parents had $800 between them when they got here. They scraped and borrowed so we could go to good schools, and I worked my ass off. No one gave me a handout. It makes me work harder.",Pointing to Adams Rebuttal.
What's your evil plan?,I object to your cynicism.
It's been earned.,That's what I object to.
"My theory is that you're running a battery of tests to convince him that you saved his life, then con him into funding you to hire back your team.",Sarcastically What?
Your old team?,Shouts What?
"This is your new reality. You've got your office. You've got neighbors. You've got one employee, one volunteer. Until she finds actual, paid work, or gets sick of you.",I talked to Chase and Taub. They're willing to come back.
What about Thirteen?,Not a good choice. She's not long term because she has no long term.
Not taking your calls?,She will.
Discharge the Patient.,"Unexplained loss of consciousness could be cardiomyopathy, global anoxia, subarachnoid hemorrhage"
"You've got two choices, House. You can recognize that your Patient is just a very nice, healthy guy, and send him home, or you can consider altruism a symptom. In which case, you cannot take his money. Walks out",To Park Send him home. And check with admitting for the net worth of all new Patients.
"Sitting in a couch I'm not coming back, House.","Technically, you're back right now."
"While standing upI need you to stop calling me. First 17 messages were cute, but",I'm putting the band back together.
"Interesting that you nEver showed up at my place, what with your love of annoying me and your inability to take no for an answer. I'm guessing ankle monitor.",Showing her his monitor Guilty as charged. Literally.
"I'm not a doctor anymore, House.","The job went away, but not the profession."
Turns out I like boring.,"No, you wanna like boring. But if you actually liked boring, you would have figured that out in fifth grade, when you were bored."
Please stop calling me.,As she leaves No.
As she leaves No.,You showed up to tell me that you don't want to hear from me.
Patient got tachycardic to 185. We pushed 18 milligrams adenosine. There's definitely something wrong with him.,"Which is awesome. Now there's something to cure, which means there's something to be disproportionately financially grateful for."
Got you a coffee. Thanks.,Arrhythmia could easily have caused the collapse that landed Father Teresa in here in the first place.
What about Whipple's?,"If it was Whipple's, there'd be some kind of neurological involvement."
You don't think defying huMan nature is neurological?,Racing heart Medical condition. Bleeding heart Stupid condition.
"Are you saying that because you beliEve it, or because it's in your financial best interest to think his generosity isn't just temporary?",I'm told that some people are just nice. I'm trying to embrace that wisdom.
Benjamin's been taking allergy medication the last few weeks. Long QT syndrome can be medication-induced.,"Flush him with saline, get rid of the antihistamines, then do an EKG."
Walks out Benjamin's room--,I just got so angry.
How about I help you out?,How do you mean?
"I'll give a million dollars as an endowment to the hospital, earmarked for diagnostics.",Wow.
Is that bad?,Ethics are not my strong suit.
Ethics are not my strong suit. Wilson's office--,"Hypothetical if I'm offered oral sex from a sexaholic, do I have to decline?"
"You can't take sex from a sexaholic. You can't give booze to an alcoholic, and you can't take this guy's money.",Could be wrong about the symptom. I'm wrong all the time.
Taking money from a sick person is ethically suspect at best.,"What is this, Canada? All we do is take money from sick people."
We work for it.,I'm working!
I'm working! How much?,"20 dollars. Wilson gesticulates Well, what if it was? It's the same principle. 20 dollars, a million! What's the difference?"
"Actually, the difference is pretty much a million dollars.","He came up with the figure, not me."
"Crap. Got a Patient with end stage renal disease. Her heart can't support dialysis. She needs a transplant, but! House is thinking, looking distracted you tuned out as soon as it stopped being about you, didn't you?",What?
I gotta go.,"It's all moot. Patient pRobably has long QT. PRobably just a really, really decent person. They exist, right?"
"I'm not sure, but it's not what we thought it was. PPTH cafeteria--","So! arrhythmia, fainting, muscle tremors. Plus, unfortunately, mental changes."
To House I still don't think it's neurological. Park sits beside Adams,God bless you.
He lost his wife because she couldn't accept not being filthy rich.,To Park She's not drinking the coffee either.
Why? Why?,"Yeah, why?"
You're not a stranger. And your perverse view of the world is making you force a neurological component onto an obviously cardiological,Your parents didn't love you enough.
There's a whole list of drugs that could have caused his symptoms.,I doubt the guy would spend money on drugs when there are orphans out there without cable.
That comes with a rash. Echovirus.,"Echoing Virus, virus, virus, virus!"
"Fits his physical symptoms. And could, but doesn't necessarily cause personality changes. House and Park look at her Works for Everyone?",Start him on antivirals.
on the phone from her House Click the third tab from the left and find the box that says previous entries. You get a drop-down menu sorted by Patient name and department.,Thank you. Appreciate your help.
"You're gonna read too much into this, aren't you?","No, not at all."
We're gonna fundamentally disagree about what it means to read too much into this. Aren't we?,"Yes, absolutely."
"Look, I thought about what you said, and I realized you were right.",Great. See you tomorrow morning.
"No, you won't.",Afternoon? I can't think of another interpretation.
"Shut up. Look, I'm not sure what you were trying to aParkEve. I'm nEver quite sure. But you were actually a friend to me when I needed it. I don't wanna come back to work for you. But I was wrong to try to push you out of my life.","Looking at his computer screen Everything has gone blue. That's not supposed to happen, right?"
Stay there. I'm comin'.,"No! you don't have to do that. Although, if you did come, maybe you could swing by the Hunan Palace and get some lo mein and a Szechuan beef."
That is six miles out of my way.,"Oh, okay, then. Guess I'll get something from the hospital cafeteria, which is where I get all my meals since I can't go anywhere."
Sighs Fine. I'll get the food.,You're a peach.
What's your Patient's status?,Better. We're discharging him.
Sighs Good. Starts walking back to the clinic,"Hey, hey, hey. Why do you care? Specifically. Although I'm curious about a general answer too."
Your guy just signed up to donate a kidney to my Patient with renal failure.,Did he meet your Patient with renal failure?
"No, he heard the nurses talking about her, that she was short on time.",I was wrong.
"Don't say that. House, she really needs this kidney.",He's not better. His mental status is declining.
Or he's doing an amazing thing for another huMan being.,I thought it was an ethical no-brainer that we can't take stuff from sick people.
"PPTH corridor, walking to Benjamin's room--",He's still sick.
His symptoms have gone away.,Not all of them. Offering an organ to a stranger is a symptom.
A couple dozen people a year make undirected kidney donations.,"Yeah, how Many of them are also in the process of pauperizing themselves?"
"If the guy threw himself on a grenade, he'd be a hero. If it saves a life, who cares?","You do! Yesterday, when you made the exact opposite argument. If there's Even a chance I'm right, it'd be dangerous to give his kidney to someone else."
More dangerous than complete renal failure? My Patient needs this. Now.,"Yeah. If only we could kill 60,000 more people a year, all would be golden."
I'll give you your money.,See? Crazy.
She'll die without it. Perfectly logical.,People with mental deficiency can be logical. Just like sane people can be illogical.
"Dr. House, it's not a symptom. Come back after you're convinced that I'm healthy, and I will give you your money.","No, you won't. Limps out to a bench where Park is sitting. She gets up and follows him"
"No, you won't. Limps out to a bench where Park is sitting. She gets up and follows him",We have time for one more test before we move him.
We have time for one more test before we move him. What test?,"WhatEver test will prove there was an echovirus-irus-irus, and he's not cured, obviously."
"I've been saying all along this could be Whipple's. Causes arrhythmia, tremor, and mental changes.",Bad idea. There's no joint pain. Where's Adams?
Why is she here?,'Cause I called her. Bigger question is why that worked.
I'm here because I have time and you have a crisis and I,We're too busy for rationalizations. Patient made a big downgrade in his personal life. He's pRobably not eating all that healthy.
He's pRobably not eating all that healthy. Magnesium deficiency?,"Wait until they take him back to his room draw blood, do an expanded electrolyte profile."
"Joint pain is common, but not definitive. Whipple's explains all of his symptoms, including the personality change. And it would respond to antibiotics, which is why he started to feel better. Which doesn't mean he's not still sick.",To Park You were right. Counts for nothing if you can't defend it. Book a procedure room. Do an upper endoscopy and run a PCR test for Whipple's.
To Park You were right. Counts for nothing if you can't defend it. Book a procedure room. Do an upper endoscopy and run a PCR test for Whipple's.,Guilt. You feel guilty about leaving.
"Yes, I think that little of you and that much of me. You're nothing without me. she gets up",Not leaving me. Leaving huManity.
I'm going with my girlfriend. The Woman I love.,To have fun.
"You're trying to make me feel guilty because you're saving lives here. And I think that's great. I'm proud to have been a part of it, but! now! I just wanna be happy.",Oh! no one's unhappy in Greece.

And that was supposed to be the end of it. I! don't take charity.,Good for you! You loon.
I don't like owing people things.,"So either you're so insecure that you feel like you need to always have the upper hand, or you're so arrogant that the notion of a favor is insulting to you."
I just don't like it. It makes me feel! icky.,That's the reason? Ickiness? You nEver Even tried to analyze this? It's Even crazier than the gift thing.

Almost always hits the kidneys.,"Ah, Dr."
You're off the case.,That seems like an overreaction.

What'd you give him?,Nothing! You can't prove otherwise. So why don't you do the smart thing here?
You can't let him do this.,Sighs He's the boss. And he's right.
I assume you dosed the Patient because you're really certain he has a neurological condition?,I assume you're interpreting my actions in the best possible light 'cause you didn't get the job? Paper crumpling What's with you and Park?
Paper crumpling What's with you and Park? Nothing.,I expect my people to lie better than that.
I just! I thought it was interesting she couldn't accept that coffee. I wanted to see how deep it went.,But now?
"Oh, now I just want to win.",Chuckles softly What was in the box?
Gift certifiCate. The Spa.,"Nah, that's not gonna do it."
"Nah, that's not gonna do it. You're up against a lifetime of training. If you wanna win, you gotta do something she can't possibly reciproCate.

It's unlikely! but it's possible. What else? Nobody says a thing I said what else?,"Oh, for!"
"Nobody says a thing I said what else? Oh, for!","There. That's better. Now, what else? Thirteen, Adams, and Park are all out of ideas. Well, if there's nothing better than possible, then possible gets upgraded to pRobable."
"No, I'll go. She gets up and leaves the office. House follows her to the hall","So what's the answer? Are you now on the team? Mocking Park Like, forEver?"
I don't know.,'Cause I was thinking of ordering T-shirts.
'Cause I was thinking of ordering T-shirts.,So! guilt?

Wilson's office-- House opens the door.,How's your Patient?
"No department. No money. And somehow, you Managed to con her into hanging around.","I have a gift. Suddenly, it hits him. He gets one of his million-yard stares, those where he figures what's the deal with his Patient, typical when he's with Wilson"
"He gets one of his million-yard stares, those where he figures what's the deal with his Patient, typical when he's with Wilson What?",It was a con.
The Patient was faking?,"No, I was."

What about another clotting pRoblem? Factor 5 Leiden deficiency.,It's possible. Adams is the one who needs to deal with her anger.
Adams is the one who needs to deal with her anger. Myelodysplastic syndrome.,I heard about your conversation with the Patient's daughter. You were hostile.
"Well, their company's making a decision I strongly disagree with.",Yet you were nEver anything but courteous to the racists and rapists in prison. Those guys made decisions you supported?
Those guys made decisions you supported? Myelodysplastic syndrome.,I'm guessing it has something to do with the funeral you attended yesterday morning.
I was at a job interview.,You got to work at 915. Closest hospital with an opening in your specialty is 45 minutes away. It's not possible. My condolences.
I wasn't at a funeral.,That just leaves! Everywhere but a job interview.
That just leaves! Everywhere but a job interview.,Who goes there? REveal yourself!
Now. He enters and walks toward his desk.,"Well, we would. But Orthopedics is still squatting in two thirds of my office, which is weird, 'cause you got a large check last night. He points at the desk."
What are you doing?,Holding your ass. You really didn't know?
You really didn't know? House!,Just trying to help you out here.
Why! did you do that?,We have a bet.
But he's the chair of the disciplinary committee. Forget about the bet.,You two really need to do your homework with me. Treat the Patient with activated protein c.
"And if he has Factor 5 Leiden deficiency, he'll throw another clot.",Exactly.
Is this supposed to itch like this?,ItParkng. Interesting.
Not interesting. Already went away.,Doubly interesting. Means we have to explain the arrival and the departure.
Turn that off.,Different wavelengths are stimulating your autonomic nervous system. That's what's making you feel like you're on a boat in choppy waters.
Different wavelengths are stimulating your autonomic nervous system. That's what's making you feel like you're on a boat in choppy waters.,Oh ho ho! Cool.
"Oh, you will. And! I'll deny it, and he'll beliEve you. But then these two beliEve that the policy of protecting American jobs starts at home. So they'll nEver testify against me. And you won't be able to prove anything.","Now, if I punched him in the face, that he could prove."
I remember you saying something about how loyalty to real estate was stupid.,"This is about reclaiming stolen property! Loyalty to real estate is stupid, because loyalty is stupid."
"First patriotism, now loyalty. You hate ice cream too?","French vanilla, yeah. To willfully identify yourself as something else is a perversion of self-expression."
I had a thought. Other than the fact that loyalty is the basis of all meaningful relationships. The daughter said that her mother died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. What if she was misdiagnosed?,Dutch chocolate's not bad. Gotta give 'em that.
"Her lymphoma could have been caused by a virus, HTLV-1, which our Patient contracted through having sex with his wife.","In other words, loyalty gave him cancer. I like it. Start him on radiation. He leaves his office."
Chang and Eng Bunker. It's the most famous conjoined twins in history. 2011 is the bicentennial of their birth.,The best Halloween costumes are always the ones that need an explanation. Park comes in. What took you so long? I already lost one of them.
You need help with the lacerations?,"No, I think I got palliative. Why don't you take prEventative?"
PrEvent what? He got in a fight.,Which he started. Which means he's both irascible and stupid.
"I told the drunk, racist frat guy the proper term is conjoined twin, not Siamese.",I can't comment on the drunk or the frat.
"Sometimes, it's incredibly satisfying to wind up and punch someone who really deserves it. But when you think about the consequences","Okay, let's go."
I thought you wanted me to help him with his anger.,"No, I got Everything I need."
"No, I got Everything I need. Sometimes!",Sometimes! With playback It's incredibly satisfying to wind up and punch someone who deserves it. Wonder what the committee's gonna make of that.
EKG and troponins were equivocal. It's not Even clear if our Patient just had a heart attack or what it was.,Let's look at segmental wall motion abnormalities.
And you want to do some insider trading? I take it felonies aren't a violation of your parole?,"It's not insider trading. Just betting on myself to solve the case. Once we cure him, share price goes up, I pay you back."
"Once we cure him, share price goes up, I pay you back. No.","No, you don't say no. You! make a counter offer."
I'm not loaning my boss money.,"Fine. I'll make you a counter. $100,000. $20,000. I'll buy options instead of shares. More risk, but more upside. But that's as low as I'm gonna go."
"I could do $5,000.",Really? No backsies.
If! you double your clinic hours. Six a week. I've seen how you disrespect those Patients.,So you want twice as Many of them disrespected?
"Spend more hours with them, you'll treat them more huManely.","And this time, a land war in Russia will be a good idea."
"And this time, a land war in Russia will be a good idea. Deal?",Here's what I'm thinking.
"Here's what I'm thinking. You went to a parole hearing, where one of your old Patients was denied. Hence the attire, hence the tardiness. And, most important, hence the anger. You think you can restore the cosmic balance by doing extra good here. More annoyingly, by having me do it. Adams walks away. And deal!","Of course, you know! this means war."
"If the plumbing's fine, check the electrical. EP study.","Nice idea. Even has a metaphor in it. Not worth more than my honor. But delightful, all the same."
I'm not going to lose. My college roommate is the editor of the Yale Law Review. She's writing my opening statement.,You will be eloquent in your loss.
I already told Foreman he'd been drinking that night.,"Andrews was taking sexual harassment classes, not AA."
Then why isn't he saturated?,Seems healthy to me.
"Instead, I am going to lose $20,000. 20?",Your five plus the five I stole from Wilson.
"And extrapolating, tomorrow you'll owe just shy of $1 million.","It's your own fault. You forced me to go with the options here. Your damn anger issues are screwing with my finances. Regular stock this time, nice and safe."
I'm not angry. I don't know if you're trying to make me angry.,You refuse to bet on yourself. That means low self-esteem.
"So if I give you $200,000, I'll feel smart and pretty.",Low self-esteem can be brought on by exposure to one's relatives.
Low self-esteem can be brought on by exposure to one's relatives. Nice clothes and anger! Classic symptoms. Family gathering. You were late the other day 'cause you were having breakfast with Grammy Adams or Cousin Itt. And she was nagging you about finding a husband.,"Ah, ah, ah, ah! He stops her with his cane. No spoilers. They ruin Everything."
Pulmonology was that way.,Our Patient's lung pRoblem is not a lung pRoblem. It's a brain pRoblem. We're consulting with Neurology.
That's my old boss. You don't actually think this is neurological.,"I don't know what it is. Maybe I should just accept the Patient's death, if getting help can lead to awkwardness."
"I don't know what it is. Maybe I should just accept the Patient's death, if getting help can lead to awkwardness.",Dr. Andrews. My associates. Doctors Adams and Park. Park seems very uncomfortable.
Can we go now?,You really wanna turn your back on this guy? Sorry. Carry on.
Uh! well! It sounds like there could be spinal cord involvement. Have you considered normal pressure hydrocephalus?,"Okay, normal pressure hydrocephalus going once. Normal pressure hydrocephalus going twice!"
Then it's a good thing he has A.D.S.,"Do you really beliEve in this diagnosis? Because if this is just a pissing contest, you are at a sEvere anatomical disadvantage."
It's autonomic dysregulation syndrome.,No! it's normal pressure hydrocephalus. Do a spinal fluid test to confirm.
She's not yours to fire.,"You guys better fire her for insubordination, 'cause she went rogue, and my Patient is now in a coma."
"No, it was my idea! Seriously, House?",At least I'm smart enough to know what I don't know.
I can't beliEve you did that.,Right back at ya. Our Patient's dying. We need theories.
It's gotta be normal pressure hydrocephalus. Andrews predicted the coma.,"Yeah, but Even a broken doctor's right twice a day. Patient wasn't wet, wobbly, or wacky. Coma had to be a lucky guess."
"If you didn't think he was right, then why did you want us to collect his spinal fluid?",I didn't. I wanted you to do a tilt table test.
You have a wonderful way of communicating.,I knew Park wanted to do a tilt table.
"I knew Park wanted to do a tilt table. She listens to me, I waste an hour. If she defies me! Then I get the test I want and my 100 bucks. Holding his hand up Up high.",You're angry.
Yes! Now I'm angry. Let's run the test for normal pressure hydrocephalus.,No. What else would explain our symptoms and make our Patient go into a coma during that test? How 'bout hepatic encephalopathy?
"No, we already tested his liver enzymes. They're normal.",Or his liver's so far gone it can't Even produce enzymes.
"Biopsy was clean. It's not his liver. I also ran the spinal fluid test, and you were right that Andrews was wrong. His ICP was not normal. It was elevated. What about HTLV?",We ruled that out three days ago.
"Because of his heart pRoblems, but","Once something gets taken off the board, I'm the only one who's allowed to put it back on."
"You owe me 106,804 Yuan. Or $100 U.S.","God, but you're petty. Okay, so! two options. Either we figure out what's wrong with this guy, or we figure out how to make this company profitable in New Jersey."
Brain scans indiCate it could be Loa loa disease.,"Ah, shut it off!"
"Ah, shut it off!",Apparently we're allowed to do this now.
"Get out of here, House!",This diagnosis was brought to you by the letter Y.
"God, you're okay. I'm thirsty.",That's a side effect of not dying.
So I'm gonna be completely cured.,It's not all about you.
"He just woke up. Dad, you don't have to deal with this right now. House stops her.","Ah, mm, yeah, actually!"
"Dad! I can't do it. If this is really about family, you will not do this.",Morning.
"If this is really about family, you will not do this. Morning.",Got lucky this time.
"No, you didn't. I made this bet so you'd stop actively trying to fire Park so you'd be neutral. You went out of your way to help her. She obviously earned your respect, passed whatEver test you","I sabotaged her hearing. You do read the school paper, don't you?"
"If you had sabotaged her hearing, she would have gotten more than a slap on the wrist. What you actually did was make her emotional and make the board members see her as a victim.",'Cause the panel feels badly for incompetent doctors who nearly kill people.
"You know that Everyone on that panel hates you. You know the minute you recommend firing anyone, they start discussing how big a bonus to give them.",That's just hurtful.
What five grand?,Just take it. Trust me.
Just take it. Trust me.,Found her sleeping in the Park. Said she ran away because her daddy didn't love her. And that is exactly what happened! as far as you can prove.
Congratulations. You're not going to jail! today. But you do know I just can't let this slide. You need to keep up your rep.,Fine. Clinic hours. I'll double them.
Okay. 12 hours a week.,No! Three times two equals six.
And 3 times 2 times 2 is 12. I know about your deal with Adams.,Call Chase and Taub. Get 'em in here. The boys are back.
This check is for significantly more than what I told you it would take to fund the department.,I know.
You paged me?,Congratulations.
You paged me? Congratulations.,You caught your boyfriend cheating that morning.
It wasn't my boyfriend. It was my husband. I was at my Lawyer's office signing the divorce papers.,Wow. I missed the fact that you were married.
We've been separated for almost a year.,So!
Male Patient went into v-fib but shows no signs of heart disease,What was he doing when his heart decided to do the mambo?
He said he was at work.,You're late.
"According to my calendar, I'm a week early.",Beard's a nice touch.
And I look forward to working with you as well.,"He's lying, not just Taub! the Patient. These abrasions on his knees! they're minty fresh! about ten hours old."
He got them playing flag football.,He said he got them playing flag football. I'm sure that's true if flag is a euphemism for penis and football is a euphemism for entering a vagina.
Why lie about it? Everybody lies.,"Speaking of which, how are your two baby girls?"
"Wow, twins! congratulations.",making a big show of oops wrong thing to say Awkward!
Why would I? They look just like me.,But they will grow. Find out what else he's lying about. Do an exercise test! see if you can get him to go back into v-fib again.
But we could end up causing another cardiac arrest.,Hopefully. Then we'll know what set it off.
He means it's better to do it here where we can revive him than have it happen somewhere else.,The prodigal son has returned.
It's his heart we're worried about. The test will monitor its rhythm so we can check for any abnormalities.,loudly I spent a month in solitary. You don't think I can keep this up all day?
I have a headache. Could you just lower your voice?,loudly Chase and Taub are back!
You want me to pick up an ice-cream cake?,I also think that Taub has brought his little Taubettes into work with him today.
Why would he do that?,"Because I didn't give him time to do anything else. Then I started wondering, who'd be sappy enough to watch them for him?"
They're not here.,"What? I just came for a chat with a friend. What's that I smell, friend?"
"I understand your confusion. I was eating a baby for lunch, and! House looks under the desk. I have a massive migraine. Will you please just go away?",You should pRobably lie down and rest.
Yeah. I was trying to.,at the door Oh! There is one more thing.
It's extreme and reckless. That's House. You get used to it.,sticking his head in the door at just the right moment Or I fire you.
jumps up and takes the stroller Give me my kids.,No. I genuinely wonder who they belong to. I need a DNA sample. He holds up a wrapped swab.
I'm not letting you DNA test my kids.,Already did.
Myocarditis! viral infection weakening the wall muscles. We need to biopsy his heart to confirm.,Myocarditis wouldn't cause a seizure.
Could be genetic! Brugada Syndrome.,"Oh, my God. Two prodigal sons. Come on. Let's hug it out. He holds his arms wide."
"You really like the idea, or you just want to grab some hair for a DNA test?",It's a stupid idea.
A pheochromocytoma. getting up and grabbing her end of the couch Excess adrenaline can cause heart pRoblems and! seizures.,Boring!
"I'm sorry. I thought I was here to treat the Patients, not entertain you.","Would it hurt to do both? flops over the couch back and lies down Oh, this is much better! I said it was boring. I didn't say it was wrong."
So I'm right.,"Nope. You're wrong. Photic epilepsy! it's equally boring, but it has the advantage of possibly being right. Give him an E.E.G. to confirm."
What exactly are they building back there?,A dream.
He doesn't have photic epilepsy.,"I know, because he has a pheochromocytoma."
You said I was wrong.,You were wrong not to rule out epilepsy first.
"I can't! I have my kids! Wilson's leaving in, like, minutes!",Chase and Adams can do the test.
Chase and Adams can do the test. Thank you.,For the massage bed. You and Park are checking the motel he was bumping uglies at for environmental factors.
Where is the construction crew?,"Well, I'm not gonna make them work day and night. So I chose night. He spits into a mug."
"It's not meningitis. His neck isn't stiff, and his mental status is normal.",He's only guessing. I'm talking to Taub. He can't say my kids until he lets me test them. Tell me about the love shack where he cheated on his bride.
"Lab tests show the bed tested positive for, uh, semen, vaginal secretions, saliva, and fecal matter, both huMan and animal. Taub's face falls as she reads the list.",PRobably want to boil the kids for a couple hours when you get home.
The bathroom also tested positive for five different types of pathogenic bacteria.,Fusobacterium necrophorum was one of them. He puts on his dress shirt and buttons it.
Yeah. How'd you know?,The bulge in his neck.
"The bulge in his neck. The bacteria colonized his parapharyngeal space, moved into his jugular vein, causing a thrombus! Lemierre's Syndrome. Treat with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Take out the clot before it moves to his lungs and kills him.",You have at least a trillion cells. You're gonna misplace one of them Eventually.
"We could be dealing with an alcoholic going through withdrawal. It explains his heart, seizures, and liver failing.",But not his swollen lymph nodes.
Why are we stealing cable from here? We don't Even have a TV in our office.,"I'm an ex-con, trying to adjust to a world that's passed me by."
"Cultures take time, and his liver doesn't have much left.",That's why we're gonna blast him with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
Not if we get him a liver transplant first and then treat him with a broad spectrum.,adding a toaster to his bag And old team for the win!
Some people think it's burning now. Maybe if Everybody didn't lie!,"Aw, that is cute."
Liver function has improved 30%! buys us a few extra days before he'll need a transplant.,"Interesting question is, why is it regenerating?"
"Interesting question is, why is it regenerating?",And scene. Now we're back to boring reality reality. His liver was in shock before. He's been having an allergic reaction since he got here.
We need to run a scratch test to find out what set it off.,Or who. This all started when he cheated on his wife.
He's allergic to a person?,Or something she's wearing!
Is Everyone trying to think of an answer? Or is Everyone afraid to say,I take it you're in the latter Category.
There's no treatment for it.,clicks his pen a few times It fits. Case closed. Why don't you go home and get some sleep?
I nEver heard of a neurological pRoblem that causes someone's skin to fall off.,Because there isn't one.
"Yes, we knew what kawah meant. We just figured since it basically presents only in Asian Parkldren!","Which you might have, by the way."
Monkey DNA! nice touch.,Really? You don't think I should have gone with rat? I've been second-guessing myself all day.
Where are the DNA results? He reaches for the folder House is holding but House jerks them out of the way.,First admit that I was right.
You Manipulated me into doing it.,"Yeah, I'll admit to that. Now you admit that it was incredibly easy, because you can't cheat an honest Man."
I love them. I don't care if one of them isn't biologically mine.,What about both? Could be. Haven't read these. Now say I was right.
"No. I'll admit I was weak for a moment, but I'm not doing this. I don't care.","You do, and I'll prove it."
A hot tub would be cool.,"New team, old team! I present! Phase one of Operation Outer Office 2.0."
Phase one of Operation Outer Office 2.0. Nothing's changed.,"Oh, Everything has changed."
Head CT and cerebral angiogram are normal. Clotting parameters are normal.,You're forgetting the wrinkly clump in the middle of his shirt. Thought we'd diagnose the middle-aged clown first.
looking at House It's pRobably from my seat belt.,Wrinkle pattern's too varied. It looks like someone shoved you or grabbed you.
"trying to ignore House PRobably from the diaper bag. If the Patient's using drugs, cocaine could have caused an arterial spasm in his brain.",The tox screen was clean.
The Patient was punched in the groin. Could have triggered a massive sympathetic discharge.,Carotid duplex is normal.
Why shouldn't Taub be the one to do it? Thank you?,Makes sense.
They were good parents.,"That's an oxymoron. Chase is right. All parents screw up all Parkldren. He's also dreAmy, but it's not relevant now."
"So all parents screw up all Parkldren, but it makes some huge difference if I keep my daughter here or let her move? returning to the case Endocarditis. Flipped a piece of vegetation into his brain, which could have broken up before the angiogram.","Transesophageal echo to confirm. Screwed up is your best case. Bouncing between a philandering workaholic dad and an embittered, sexually betrayed mom, it's gonna lead to screwed-up squared."
I need treatment for my type 2 diabetes.,There is absolutely no part of that sentence that is true.
"I've been experiencing weight gain, fatigue, and sluggishness.","Weight loss is a symptom of diabetes. Fatigue is a symptom of thinking you have disease you don't actually have, and sluggishness is a synonym of fatigue."
I need Insulin. I know it.,"Much as I'd like to kill you by dangerously lowering your blood sugar, murder violates my parole."
pointing to the printout of his test results That bloodwork is week's old. Test me again.,I am the test. The test is negative. The test also thinks you're a giant pain in the ass. That last insult was your cue to leave.
pulling up his sleEve Test me.,Fine. Wait right here.
Wait right here. Thank you.,to a nurse Sleep study. Please make sure he's not disturbed for the next eight hours.
We need to talk about Saturday night.,"No, no, no, no, no. Historians will talk of Saturday night, not us. The legendary night, on which we watch Santos shatter Rubio's jaw and you epically pay me $50.00."
"I have a chance to really watch it. A Patient of mine has a pair of tickets he can't use, and obviously you're under House and office arrest. I just wanted to make sure you were cool if I go to Atlantic City without you.","Uh, no, thanks. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to decline your invitation to not spend Saturday night with you."
These are ringside seats.,"Cameras are ringside too. If you want, I could sweat and spit and bleed on you from time to time."
I'd take you if I could.,"Well, I'd take me if either of us could. See what a tough spot I'm in?"
I'm going to that fight.,"All right, I'll take the other ticket. Let me worry about logistics."
"Patient's heart valves are normal. It's not endocarditis. But he has a thickened pericardium, which makes no sense.",He has a heart pRoblem but not one that could have caused his T.I.A.
"Syph test was negative. Plus, the kid's nEver been sexually active.","Yeah, I got that from the line in his chart that says birthday clown."
His late father was a circus clown. Histoplasmosis?,He's not immuno-compromised.
I mentioned it because!,Take your time. We'll continue with the medicine.
Sjogren's could have given him chronic pericarditis and cerebral arteritis.,Sjogren's it is. IV immunosuppressants to treat. looking at Taub Anything?
What are you doing with her?,Her? Surely this bundle of fun has an actual name.
I wasn't in a strong negotiating position. to House Why is she here?,Ruby dropped her off.
Patient has low platelets. Makes me think D.I.C.,She doesn't seem to like that idea. You're right. speaking baby talk He has no sParkstocytes in his smear. Chase grins
No Grey-Turner's sign.,to Taub She wasn't fussing like that when I was holding her.
So Many Parkldren of your own. No wonder you have such insight into my relationship with my babies.,Good point.
Low white count suggests infection.,What if you're all right? Low platelets plus low red count plus low white count equals!
Low platelets plus low red count plus low white count equals! Aplastic anemia.,"Kid needs a bone marrow transplant. Everyone except Adams, transfuse his platelets till you find a match."
"Kid needs a bone marrow transplant. Everyone except Adams, transfuse his platelets till you find a match.",to Adams You started college a semester late because you left high school a semester late because he pulls a small note our of his breast pocket and reads it
And you're offering one bad semester as proof that my parents screwed me up?,Did okay before that. Straight As after that.
I went through a rebellious phase.,Don't tell me. Mom and dad were at each other's throats and the academic crisis was a cry for help.
looking back at House I'm in a meeting.,"Sorry. Since you paged me, I didn't want to keep you waiting."
"Yeah, I paged you, which means you're next.",That's cool. I'll wait.
"taking a large envelope from his desk Just got this. The American Association of Rheumatology wants you to speak, 900, Saturday, in Atlantic City. Dr. Neusinger canceled on them at the last minute.",I hate conferences.
"This is a big one, and it's the premium slot. I'd like you to do it. I'll clear it with your parole Officer. What do I need to do for you?",Halve the clinic hours that you recently doubled and double the hooker budget that you recently halved. I think you refer to it as petty cash.
Fine. Just one thing. I'm gonna ask them to put you on in the morning. We're doing them a favor. Why should you have to spend the night?,"You said that 900 was the premium slot. I mean, I want to feel like I've earned my hookers."
"The place will be a madHouse, especially since it's two miles from the Rubio fight at the exact same time. Nice try. You called up, pretended to be Neusinger, cancelled, and suggested yourself as a replacement. You go to that fight, you go to prison.","But that'd be redundant, when I have an angry black guy waiting for me to drop the soap right here."
Test my urine.,Looks like I was wrong about my diagnosis.
Yeah. I have diabetes.,"No, but you're not a hypochondriac or you would have imagined some new disease after I shot down the first one."
It's not a scam. I'm sick. Now I have swollen ankles.,The medical term is cankles. sitting down on the stool Is there some black market in insulin that I don't know about?
"It's in my genes. My old Man got diabetes at 50. My older brother, got it at 50. I just turned 50.","Well, it's a great argument if diabetes was a gold watch."
"No one in mom's family's a match, and as far as she knows, dad has no living relatives. It's been years since he died.","reading the file If the kid's dad died young of melanoma, how come the overprotective mom nEver took him to a dermatologist?"
Are you gonna test my urine or what?,Not diabetes.
Not diabetes. turning back to Chase and Taub Use cross-matched platelets. Try to find the Patient some blood that's closer to his own. And get the real story on clown senior's death. Mom's hiding something. It's a good bet that it's medically relevant.,Apple juice. Easiest way to fake a spike in blood sugar.
You realize I have to invite someone else to the Rubio fight?,Nope. No realization whatsoEver.
You have a LoJack on your leg.,I was happy watParkng the fight on pay-per-view. You're the one who insisted we go to Atlantic City.
"Your biological father was a decent, God-fearing minister. The guy who raised you was a cold-hearted jerk. I'm trying to figure out why you're so convinced Adams has parentally inflicted damage.",You're trying to deflect.
Now you are. You have to beliEve that Every parent screws up Every Parkld or you were screwed out of a decent Parkldhood.,My decent daddy of the cloth was also being indecent with my married mom. He pRobably would have taken other kids to the playground.
My decent daddy of the cloth was also being indecent with my married mom. He pRobably would have taken other kids to the playground.,It's not my fault. Bad parenting. House slides out of the booth and leaves

Easier to pack in small crates. Plus the shipping's a lot cheaper.",from the phone Won't Even trust a co-worker. What did your parents do to you?
It means you don't have to make that drive. The pRoblem isn't his marrow. It's his liver.,"Liver failure. Explains Everything. The question is, what explains the liver failure?"
"It's not an infection. We tried antibiotics, but he's not responding.","More curiously, what explains the mom lying about dad pushing up squirting daisies?"
Why are you looking at her?,"'Cause I'm stunned, and I have to look at something. Match, bout, fight, contest, day, Helena. Almost anything works after boxing, except the word game."
Your bigger pRoblem is the people who design those things aren't idiots. Huh huh.,Can you beliEve she used to work in the can? Nothing is tamper-proof.
"It's a synthetic pRoblem. His liver's not synthesizing proteins, so fluid is leaking out of his blood vessels. And mom's a selfish jerk. She traded up, married a Lawyer, wants to forget the lowly circus clown.",You're defending the father because you feel like a jerk for baking buns in two different ovens.
She Robbed them of 12 years together.,Or she ripped off the band-aid too late.
"Or she ripped off the band-aid too late. That memory that she let son of Bozo establish is making him Chase his father's moronic profession when he could be living the high life in Portland. And I mean that metaphorically, of course.",to the workMan This is where you dazzle me with your contingency plan.
to the workMan This is where you dazzle me with your contingency plan.,I see why employers are reluctant to hire ex-cons.
"Can't treat for both. One requires hemodialysis, the other a liver transplant, and we couldn't Even get the kid a marrow match.",Get the mom's consent to pump him full of protein.
Do you only like tests that involve the risk of death?,"There are some slower, less conclusive tests, but why take that risk? He hurries out of the office and down the hall"
He hurries out of the office and down the hall In here.,"acting surprised Oh, my God. The water. This is completely my fault. Foreman looks extremely angry"
to Taub Mitchell is not Ben's father any more than a sperm donor would have been. Dr. House?,Unless you're a locksmith or an electrician with political contacts. I'm busy.
My husband saw you in the clinic. Wants treatment for diabetes.,My condolences on your forthcoming divorce.
"He keeps imagining symptoms, and now I have to make him these awful anti-diabetic meals. She digs a couple of syringes out of her purse","Since I have no intention of testing him, treating him, or cooking for him! He looks up from his leg and sees the syringes"
Could you write me a fake prescription for Insulin?,"The advantage of fake prescriptions is, you don't have to be a real doctor to write one."

And do you think I should sacrifice myself from their lives?,"Just one life, until the other one's mommy meets someone nicer than you."

Because I didn't. All my friends' parents were divorced or having affairs or barely knew their kids' birthdays.,You envied their dysfunction.

"After I'd already approved it, which you knew because I sent you a memo.","Dr. Adams! taped under your chair is an index card. Would you read it, please?"
It's 1015 on Friday.,Damn it.
Not if the vomiting's persistent.,"Which we won't know, because the E.R. put him on antiemetics. Take him off. He sits down at the other end of the table, facing Foreman."
"Wait. He's puking his guts out. We'd risk aspiration. He smiles I'm just disagreeing, not overruling.","So glad you're on board. Take him off antiemetics, do an upper endoscopy to check for bleeds."
You know that close to 1% of the population identifies as asexual?,"We really gotta get you laid. If I have to plough that furrow myself, so be it."
I have a Patient who's asexual.,Is she a giant pool of algae?
"It's a valid sexual orientation. According to this article, at least.","Yeah, I think I read that too. Is that fugliness weekly?"
She's perfectly fine-looking. Happily married for ten years.,To a guy who loves penis enough for the both of them.
He's asexual too. Ran a complete physical on her. Nothing wrong except a common bladder infection.,100 bucks says I can find a medical reason why she doesn't want to have sex.
You're out of your mind if you think I'm letting you anywhere near my Patient.,Fine. I won't go near her. Just give me her file and any blood samples you have left over.
"No contact, whatsoEver. You talk to her, the bet is void.",No contact. Plays to my strengths anyway.
"Right now's not a good time, House.",Not for the Dean of Medicine. But it's a perfect time if you're a member of my team. Which one are you?
His liver enzymes are slightly elevated. Gallstones could've,no complaints of pain.
Steatohepatitis would make his AST and ATL lEvels rise.,"Are you calling his liver fat? Start the Patient on statins, and do a biopsy to confirm. And knock him out. I've heard he's a wiggler."
There's no need to put him under. We can confirm fatty liver with an ultrasound. House looks to Foreman pointedly. Just making an observation.,"Well done. Now, as a member of my team, you can make the equally-useful observations that the sky is blue, I'm wearing pants, and I'm ignoring your first observation."
Of course. Wait.,And there it is.
You're trying to screw with my confidence.,"Well, if I wanted to do that, I'd tell you how much the nurses hate you."
"You're trying to get me to define myself as a subordinate to keep me from Ever intervening, Even if it's fully in the scope of my duties. Like now. This isn't about diagnostics, it's about what's safe for the Patient. Do the ultrasound.",Ultrasound it is. And the nurses love you.
A few hours ago you were sure.,And that's significant why?
Sorry. Only the bleeding's medically relevant.,"No, I wasn't being rhetorical. If they are sleeping together, why do we disapprove?"
"If they are sleeping together, why do we disapprove? You're pro-infidelity?",She's not married.
"Yes, he does. He's in there. This is why you get married.",Said the divorced Woman to the divorced Man.
She is there for him in the only way that matters now. She gave up her life to take care of him.,Which proves she's an idiot.
"I was right about the antiemetics. If you kept him on them like I said, he wouldn't have gotten agitated and punched his wife.","Yes, we're back to my supposed diabolical plan to shake your confidence."
"Unless one of your index cards actually predicted the guy was gonna punch his wife, Everything you're saying is post hoc rationalization.",Dr.
You clearly wrote that after the fact.,"Dr. Adams, would you please reach into my pants? Of course she doesn't. House reaches in his pocket and retriEves yet another card."
"Dr. Adams, would you please reach into my pants? Of course she doesn't. House reaches in his pocket and retriEves yet another card.",Dr.
"No muscle symptoms, and urine had no myoglobin. TTP fits, though.","Start him on plasmapheresis. Unless! unless I need to say, mother, may I? And mother is an abbreviation. They all leave his office."
Why doesn't Chase have to be here?,You think he knows anything about women who don't want to have sex?
Hormone lEvels are normal. This Woman seems perfectly healthy. What does it matter if she says she's asexual?,It's the fundamental drive of our species.
Sex drive is in the brain. I suppose it could be psychological intimacy issues caused by Parkldhood abuse.,She's been sharing a toilet with the same guy for the last ten years.
It's not the same. Sex releases oxytocin. It's the neurochemical basis for bonding.,And that's why men always marry their right hands.
"No it's not. I've tapped over 30 guys and nEver wanted to see most of them again. House and Adams look at each other, surprised and speechless. I live next to a Jewish frat.",We are veering wildly off track. Please continue.
We've run Every test and ruled out all the options. You're gonna have to accept she just doesn't want sex.,"Lots of people don't have sex. The only people who don't want it are either sick, dead, or lying."
So maybe she's lying. You think she's had a boyfriend on the side?,For ten years? Sticking around the whole time? Doesn't make sense. Thinking! What does! He grabs his cane and leaves the room without a word.
All of the shift nurses had their hands full with a double code.,Perfectly reasonable explanation. Same thing happened to me. Couldn't find my keys for days.
"Hey, don't be an ass. Can't you see she's upset?","No, she's guilty. 'Cause instead of being at her husband's side, she was under you."
"Okay, that's y","Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
Today is Saturday.,"So, at 600 a.m., the Patient wakes up, and the first thing he sees!"
"In moments of confusion, Alzheimer's Patients regress to old routines.",So what would your husband do on a Saturday morning?
That soccer trophy you were telling me about.,It's gone. Where was practice?
Not dead until he's warm and dead.,Get him to the ICU. Start him on extracorporeal circulation.
"That'll raise his temperature too quickly, it'll cause acidosis.","We can deal with his metabolism crashing, we can't rEverse brain damage if we go too slowly."
"We still have a long way to go. Cold can be protective to the brain, but there is a possibility of damage. We also need to confirm and treat whatEver's making him sick.","I just gotta do a standard battery of tests. Blood, urine, EEG!"
Is that really necessary for a free flu shot?,Excuse me. I have to deal with someone who's having a panic attack.
I specifically said the bet was off if you contacted the Patient.,Exactly. NEver said anything about the Patient's husband.
The deal was a medical reason why she doesn't have sex.,"I admit I was stuck, until I realized the medical issue was not hers but his."
Your twisted logic can't hide the fact that tricking a Patient into being tested is completely unethical.,Come on. Don't you think she deserves to know why her husband won't bend her over the kitchen counter? You love all that caring crap.
You're not doing this out of the kindness of your heart. You're not Even doing this out of medical curiosity.,I thought I made it clear I'm doing it for the cash.
"Two people are happy, and your natural impulse is to destroy it.",How do you know she's happy? Did she tell you?
"No, Parkrping birds flew out of her butt carrying a banner.","All right, I admit that my natural impulse is to doubt peoples' claims to happiness, but yours is to be a sucker for them."
"Vomiting, liver, kidneys, and now fEver.","I don't want to tell you how to do your job, Dr."
Get to the point.,The word fEver.
The hypothermia could've caused cell necrosis.,"TTP was the diagnosis when he walked out. FEver's a little high, but it still fits. We should continue plasmapheresis."
We're missing symptoms. We should add language loss and aggression.,Should we also add forgetfulness? He's got Alzheimer's.
We've just been assuming.,Because the Patient's wife said he exhibited both for a year.
He's nEver hit her before or lost all his English. We have to consider any change since he's been admitted as relevant.,Have to? Do I need to pull out another card?
Disseminated viral infection with encephalitis. Patient complained of a sore throat a few weeks ago.,Start him on Interferon.
"We married six months after I met him. A year after that, he started forgetting things. I've known my husband longer with his Alzheimer's than without. I've watched more of him disappear than I Ever got to know. I just can't do this anymore.",You lose.
Lowering his libido and causing erectile dysfunction.,"A year on dopamine agonists, and he'll be a sex-crazed creep just like the rest of us, completely fascinated by Susie Cooper."
Hooray for us. We disproved his asexuality. We also pRobably ruined his life.,"He'll thank us. Then he'll doze off, and then in a couple hours, he'll thank us again. He sits down in front of Wilson."
It could destroy his identity. It's like a gay person being told they're really straight.,So don't tell him.
"Yeah, why bother telling a guy he has a tumor growing in his head? He'll notice it Eventually, when it starts leaking out his ears.",It's a slow-growing tumor. He'll pRobably die of boredom long before that.
You always do this. You you meddle and force me into impossible situations.,You knew the second you told me about this case that I'd get involved.
"You played me. This whole thing was about your ankle monitor. You weren't trying to undermine my confidence you were trying to inflate it. You Manufactured conflict with me so Eventually you could let me win. Getting angry You knew it was encephalitis, but you waited for me to say it because then with my ego boosted, you thought I'd be in the mood to take off your monitor because I'd think I could control you.",You're right.
She pulls Foreman aways just as House shocks Andres. Clear.,He's back.
Clear. He's back.,"I sure hope this Alzheimer's drug trial is worth a lot to this hospital, 'cause we're wasting a crap-load of time and Manpower just to let this guy watch his"
"Given his abnormal mental status, not necessarily.","Dr. Foreman, would you please reach under your chair?"
There's just wet gum under here. Where's the card?,What card?
I'm happy to leave if you have a better theory than aseptic meningitis.,Toxins. This guy went on walkabout. Chances are he's done it before.
Wife keeps the doors on the House locked.,Plenty of nasty stuff to get into during the middle of the night.
We asked about toxins on the history. The wife said she was sure to clear the House for her husband's safety.,I'm sure she succeeded.
Stop. You're not infallible. You were wrong about encephalitis.,Just before you were.
Run CSF tests. Find out what's causing the meningitis.,You said you weren't gonna overrule me diagnostically.
"And you said I wouldn't be able to help it. Apparently, you were right about that one. Foreman leaves the room.",Fine. I'll look for toxins myself.
You can't go to their House without Foreman's permission.,Don't need it. I'll talk to the toxicology PhD upstairs. He also leaves.
Don't need it. I'll talk to the toxicology PhD upstairs. He also leaves.,What about gifts from South America? Anyone send any fruits or vegetables?
"I don't think so, no. Barraco azul!",I'm gonna need your boyfriend to collect samples of plants in and around your House. Toxins are the most!
"Wait, you understand him? What's he saying?","He's he's repeating, blue shack. You know what that is? Is it somewhere where pesticides may be kept?"
It's where we had our first date.,Do you have a cleaning lady who might bring her own supplies?
What's he saying?,"If it's not relevant to the case, I don't care. And neither should you."
What did he say?,He asked who you were. She looks a bit disappointed. Don't get your hopes up. Have your boyfriend give me those samples.
It's Reye's syndrome. Patient had a sore throat a few weeks ago before he was admitted.,Reye's in adults is a reach.
Not if he took aspirin.,Aspirin in adults is a reach. Especially in a House with locked medicine cabinets.
Wasn't in the medicine cabinet. Wife used to run a floral company. Still does a few orders from home. She uses crushed aspirin in the water to make the flowers last longer.,"So the husband has a sore throat, takes an aspirin without her knowing, realizes he's got a sore throat, takes an aspirin, realizes he's got a sore throat!"
Have Chase start him on steroids. Already did.,Then why're you telling me?
MRI confirmed macroprolactinoma. He's doing the treatment.,And the wife?
And the wife?,Come on. You saved a Man's life. Course-corrected two peoples' wildly screwed-up world views. It's not bad for a day's work.
We can't smoke in here. He sits down beside House and also uses the flame to light his cigar.,We also can't summon people into the clinic based on a lie motivated by a petty bet. And yet it happens. It's an imperfect world.
We also can't summon people into the clinic based on a lie motivated by a petty bet. And yet it happens. It's an imperfect world.,Well?
Now get out. I have work to do.,Whoops.
I have work to do. Whoops.,How long has your daughter had trouble breathing?
About a week now.,The best dads wait two or more.
"Yeah, no, it's not like it's serious. I-I checked online, and it's! asthma or something.",Or something is the number one killer of teens with no medical degree. When was the last time he took you to see a doctor?
"Uh, like five months ago. We went a clinic in Trenton. I had strep throat.",You remember the antibiotic they gave you? Is it neomycin?
"Amoxicillin. House nods slightly. She passed that test. So about the inhaler for my asthma, I was",Sorry!
to her faux-father Let's get out of here.,"Since you're the brains of the operation, might wanna stick around."
"What, so I can get busted by Social Services?","No, so you can stop bleeding out of your ear."
Someone been using your head as a soccer ball? No.,"Much as I'd like to take your word for it, I have no interest in taking your word for it."
Would you - would you tell me what's going on? What's wrong with me?,I have no idea.
Why'd you ask to meet us 30 miles away from the hospital?,"picks up his right leg, plops it on the table and pulls up the pant leg to show his monitor-less ankle Because I can."
CT confirms no skull fracture. And looking at her confirms she's not 18.,"Yes, she is. Says so in the file."
We can't treat an underage Patient without a guardian. We need to call Social Services.,"I cut a deal with the Patient. We don't call, she doesn't bolt."
checking the file No sign of malnutrition. Tox screen is clear. S.T.D. panel was negative. looking toward the door And! is that Foreman?,"Oh, my goodness, it is!"
"She's a pharmaceutical rep, and this is a working breakfast.",In a restaurant that's nowhere near your home or the hospital.
Would explain the lack of fEver. Pneumococcus is pretty common among the homeless population. We should find out if she's been vaccinated.,"Sure, ask her, and when she refuses to tell you anything, start her on ceftriaxone for pneumococcus."
And if she says she has been vaccinated?,"Then don't beliEve her, and start her on ceftriaxone for pneumococcus."
How about we don't beliEve she's gonna bolt and we call Social Services?,"While I'm in the little boys' room, you can pretend that I'm seriously considering that idea."
The bathroom's that way.,Pretty sure there's one in the hospital.
"bad southern accent Hello, good sir. My brother, the General here, gots the green-apple quickstep.","One of us is in the wrong time zone. And if it's me, I need to talk to a stockbroker and anyone from the Kennedy family, in that order."
"Well, he got the runs, and we do need him up and at 'em for battle tomorrow.","It's hardly authentic, coming to a newfangled clinic, especially with a Yankee doctor."
"Sir, are you questioning my resolve?","Yes, and your sanity. I'm multitasking."
"Uh, General! Don't light out. We swore that we would see the elephant together.","Well, far be it from me to come between two nut jobs and their elephant."
I don't think so.,"So! What causes an ear bleed, breathing pRoblems, and our runaway's inability to run away?"
Fungal infection's off the table. What about transverse myelitis?,Not with normal posterior column function.
We didn't call Social Services before because we didn't want the Patient to take off. Now she can't. There's no reason for us not to call.,"Well, how about the reason that there's no reason?"
"You want to protect her because you think she's fine on her own, outside the system.",Does anyone have a position on our Patient's medical condition?
Could be endocarditis with septic emboli.,"Pull! another miss to Taub I'd turn around and shoot you, but apparently I'd miss. There's no murmurs, no Osler nodes."
"You've nEver done this before, have you?","No, I have not. But all the time I had my ankle monitor on, I was furious that I couldn't."
"But all the time I had my ankle monitor on, I was furious that I couldn't. Vasculitis fits.","nods Start treatment with steroids. She's lucky, she'll be free to flee again."
Not once I call Social Services. I'm not giving up.,"You wanna bet? shows her a shotgun shell One shot, one birdie. You hit, you make the call. You miss, nEver mention it again."
No. Why would I agree?,'Cause your only other option is you call and I fire you.
Hiring a hooker to pretend to be a social worker?,"She took a bet that she knew she'd win. Frankly, I feel violated."
"Apparently, someone identifying themselves as Dr. Pujols called and said the Patient ran off.",giggles Come on. Poo holes.
You should have told me you were treating an underage clinic Patient.,I was giving you the gift of deniability.
Now I'm giving you the gift of additional clinic hours.,"smug No, you're not."
smug-er You've got nothing on me. Check your phone.,Uh!
"I'm not gonna let you blackmail me, House.","Oh, of course not."
"Oh, of course not. There's no way someone of your integrity would let me compromise your job in any major way over some tawdry bit of gossip. But what about compromising it in a minor way? Reduced clinic hours. Unlimited Internet porn budget. That makes much more sense than the nuclear option of ruining both our lives. You can keep these. I got copies. leaves",How I miss the sweet smell of stickin' it to the Man.
Adams is right. You're protecting this girl.,"sniffs again No, I was wrong. It's the stench of moralizing. I'm protecting myself from meddling bureaucrats and parents."
"You admire this girl. She had a horrible home life, so she went out on her own. She's your road not taken.",I've always dreamed of living in an abandoned House with mold.
"House, all I'm accusing you of is having a connection with a Patient. This is a good thing.","It's not a good thing, 'cause it's not a thing."
We need help in here!,Go!
You bet 100 bucks on a turtle race?,I paid Mr. Parkps 5 bucks to take a dive.
"Diagnosis depends on whether the blood was coming from the sinuses, lungs, or her guts. Mr. Parkps has wandered away from the center circle. Mr. Parkps looks like he wants it. 100 bucks says he'll make soup out of Franklin.",You're on.
How'd the mom seem to you?,"If you're asking him if she looks like someone who beat her kid, you're a moron."
"Acid reflux causes asthma, and the acid erodes the stomach, causing the bleeding. Yes!",Franklin rules.
Ellen shouldn't have consent if she beat her daughter.,Doesn't matter if she beat her daughter. Only matters if Social Services says she beat her daughter. Good thing you made it all official.
Not initially. It was a pretty tough conversation. Neither of us is ready,You didn't need to shoot yourself. I could have given you a Section 8.
"in a Yankee accent We've hit the drills pretty hard, and by the fourth round, my hand went numb. The-the gun slipped and I only had blanks in it, but!",It's funny how nearly shooting your toe off cured that speech impediment.
Ah. Yeah. Sorry about that. Sheldon's a! progressive.,Eh compared to who? Rupert Murdoch?
Progressives are reenactors who strive for complete authenticity. They nEver drop character while in uniform.,Whereas you just dabble in crazy.
"sighs Sheldon and I had a big falling out years ago. We only really started talking again because of the reenactments. They, uh! gave me my brother back.",That's a very moving story. Be a lot more affecting if you hadn't bonded over something so completely idiotic.
Explains esophageal ulcers and her other symptoms.,"joining them If only it would explain why we've nEver seen her drunk, drinking, or detoxing."
It's been mildly elevated.,Mildly elevated BP could put her at risk of a Berry aneurysm.
CT didn't show any signs of an aneurysm.,"Did I mention they come and go? Much as your presence may cause objects to become engorged with blood, sometimes aneurysms just aren't in the mood."
Alcoholism and Berry aneurysm are both valid theories. I think we should discuss this with the Patient and her mom.,"Why? We discussed it right here. Go tell 'em she needs a cerebral angiogram to loCate the aneurysm, then surgery to repair."
The Patient asked me what I thought.,"I pay you to think inside this room. Outside this room, I pay you to parrot."
It's her choice. She has the right to know!,It's a medical choice that you turned into an extension of your baggage and hers.
You think she wants to feel responsible for her daughter's illness?,That Woman sees Everything to do with her daughter through! guilt-colored glasses. It's all her fault. He exhales loudly then starts to leave.
House! don't! bully her. She's overwhelmed enough.,"Well, it's nothing compared to how she's gonna feel when her daughter dies from the aneurysm she decided not to treat."
You must be Dr. House.,I save my appearances for when parents are on the brink of doing something incredibly stupid.
"Well, I can't just leave this up to her.","Then leave it up to me, and just leave."
Ohh. I'm not gonna abandon my daughter.,She hates you.
It's a little late for that. Good night.,Morning!
I heard you went head-to-head with the mom.,Not for your reasons.
You're protecting the girl.,I'm protecting my diagnosis.
And you tested her see if you could get her back on drugs and out of her daughter's life.,That was to show Adams that Mommie Dearest hadn't changed. I'm taking a principled stand against idealism.
"Your Patient's stable? Well, maybe Adams was right. The illness is alcohol-related.","Well, I hope so, considering it's what we're treating her for."
You-you hope you're wrong for the sake of the Patient?,I hope that I'm right but the aneurism bursts without killing her.
"still in character But all the menfolk been eatin' it, and we the only ones that's sick.",Which one of you is the cheap bastard?
Because they don't cost anything.,"Brother against brother. Now, that is authentic."
Get me a micro-vascular clip tray as well as the occlusion.,on speaker from the observation deck Check the ventricles.
Ventricles are clear too.,Aneurysm must have leaked instead of burst. Inject the dye.
Her BP's dropping. Start her on pressors. We gotta get her BP up before her organs start shutting down.,Adams! with me.
"She got a little better when we put her on steroids, which can attack tumor cells. Maybe she has cancer.","No hypercalcemia, no elevated blood proteins."
She and her mom mentioned a trip they took to Florida a couple years ago what about dengue fEver? Cholera?,"Great ideas, if dengue fEver or cholera laid in wait for two years before suddenly!"
"Great ideas, if dengue fEver or cholera laid in wait for two years before suddenly!",Did your biological daughter go swimming in Florida? In a lake or a pond or an Everglade?
Uh!yeah. There's a canal near my mother's House. Do you know what's wrong with her?,Family vacations kill. He heads into the O.R. Come with me. Don't want to explain this twice.
You're letting in the flies. And she needs an LVAD.,"No, she doesn't."
"Callie agrees with you! that people don't change. She said when her mom slips again, she didn't want to be there. She'd rather remember her like she is now.",Smart girl.
You got the ending you wanted.,"'Cause I was only looking to solve the case, not their lives."
This is Mark Sanchez. Do you know what sound people make about him? Pffftt! He blows a raspberry.,Working late? Husband have her tonight?
And Every night. She broke it off. It's for the best. I'm not really an affair guy after all.,"Sure you are, buddy."
"I'm not like you, House.",True. No limp.
"Let the record show that we are officially convening a disciplinary hearing regarding the Events of February 3, 2012 in Patient room 209. Dr. House, this recording will be transcribed and published along with all supporting documentation and rulings. Do you have any questions before we get started?",Yeah. Who the hell are you?
"I'm Walter Cofield, Parkef of Neurology, Mercy Hospital. I'll be deciding your fate today.",Cofield.
"This hearing isn't about me, Dr. House. I know you'd like to make it about me, because then it wouldn't be about you.",It's interesting that he'd pick the old mentor to Judge the new one.
"Interesting, but not relevant. The facts of this case, on the other hand","interrupting The facts are in the file. If you have trouble reading my handwriting, give me a call. I'm going back to work."
"If I just consider the file, the facts aren't in your favor. The facts say you should be suspended, which, from what I understand, would mean a revocation of your parole.",The Patient was a 32-year-old high school chemistry teacher. He collapsed while out jogging. He was paralyzed in all four extremities despite the fact that the scans!
Show no sign of stroke or structural lesions.,Put out an APB for a car with a Man-shaped dent in the grill?
"No broken bones, no signs of trauma.",Transverse myelitis. Boring.
No enhancement on the MRI. I just don't know what to do. pleading Please. You have to help me solve this thing.,A little poetic license. He takes some Vicodin.
What are you doing?,Taking my Vic-amins.
Those are Vicodin? Did you have surgery recently?,About a decade ago. My leg is no good at judging time.
Were you taking Vicodin during this case?,Uhh!
"And when bad things happen, we should figure out what went wrong, so we can learn from it and correct it.",So that we can assign blame instead of recognizing that bad things sometimes happen. It was nobody's fault.
And then what happened?,"Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach. Those who can't teach, teach gym. Those who can't move their arms or legs teach us to laugh at others."
And why did House think that was stupid?,"Oh, come on. Unless you're an idiot, you know why I thought Park was an idiot."
looks at Patient file The Patient had low opening pressure on his LP.,That's what I said.
That's what I said.,"No, you idiot. The Patient had low opening pressure on his LP. Try unsquinting your eyes and reading the labs next time."
Are you intentionally trying to get me to dislike you?,That wasn't me. The chair squeaked.
"You're testifying, for the record, that you actually used the phrasing unsquint your eyes? It's not the place to exorcise your guilt just b",I actually used the phrasing enunciating clearly into the recorder unsquint your eyes.
EKG was normal.,"But Chase, a doctor who actually takes the time to read the lab reports, has a point. The guy's potassium is off. Could be thyrotoxic paralysis. Start him on!"
"But Chase, a doctor who actually takes the time to read the lab reports, has a point. The guy's potassium is off. Could be thyrotoxic paralysis. Start him on!","!steroids, PTU, and beta blockers."
Mm-hmm. And how did these orange smudges get on the Patient files?,"Seriously? That's your follow-up? I eat a lot of Cheetos, I forget to wash my hands. Is my snacking really relevant to this case?"
"What are they? Seriously, House?",You're blaming me? You used Adams' shampoo.
calmly I didn't do it.,It was a harmless prank. My team is made up of Type A personalities. They need something to break the tension Every once in a while.
Sounds like a very diplomatic way of saying he's lazy.,"That's also true. Either way, I'm covered. If you want an accurate Patient history, don't Ever talk to the Patient. Everybody lies. Except me. To you. Would nEver do that."
"Okay. Say you're right. If you had actually been in the room, questioning the Patient, you could read body language, you could ask follow-up questions, warn him of the costs of lying to you.",Don't forget the thumbscrews.
"Looks like you've gone viral, hon.","He had a loss of consciousness, temporary paralysis! But when I was told the Patient coughed up blood, then things really started to get interesting."
"Your Patient was doubled over in pain and coughing up blood, and you found that interesting?","Why, is that bad?"
"He smacked his head against the wall. If that caused swelling in his brainstem, that would have led to Eventual loss of consciousness and paralysis.",muffled Nobody move.
But House found it. Mm-hmm.,You can leave when I have an answer.
"through his lab coat sleEve, which he is holding to his nose and mouth It might help if we knew the question.",How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs?
speaking quickly with the front of her blouse pulled up over her nose Maybe we can use a bronchoalveolar lavage to wash 'em out with water.,Sorry. My fault. Should have clarified. How do we treat chemical burns inside the lungs without killing the Patient?
hands cupped over her mouth and nose Silver sulfadiazine works well on chemical burns.,Burn cream would drown him faster than water. waves stink bomb Well?
temporarily parting the lapels of his lab coat and sticking his head up Aerosolized heparin.,Me likey.
But that's only experimental. It's nEver actually been used before.,Not true.
It's nEver actually been used before. Not true.,Been used in sheep.
Been used in sheep. Uh-huh.,The guy was going downhill fast. We needed a treatment that was a! slope changer.
So you busted out the sulfur dioxide stink bomb?,It was a team-building exercise.
No. It was Manipulation. You were pressuring your team into coming up with unsafe medical ideas just to get out of that room.,"You say pressure, I say inspire. The usual safe ideas were not gonna work. Aerosolized heparin might."
How does Dr. House handle it when three smart doctors come up with three different but equally valid ideas?,I run a diagnostic trial.
I run a diagnostic trial.,Start the Patient on high-dose steroids.
"Start the Patient on high-dose steroids. Multiple birds, single stone. If Taub is right, then he will walk out of here cured. If Adams is right, he'll spike a fEver, get hypotensive, we can treat it. He can walk out of here cured. If Park is right, he goes all cuckoo's nest on us, we can cross brain off the list!","!diagnose him, and he can walk out of here cured."
"Are you trying to make this easy for me? By your own admission, if you give the Patient steroids, two of the three outcomes are gonna make him worse.",What was making the Patient worse was not having a diagnosis. This was the fastest way to get it. It was a perfect diagnostic moment.
"In light of what happened, you still think it was the perfect diagnostic moment?",Yes. My theory accounted for all the medical outcomes. Cofield raises one eyebrow. It did not account for the disobEdience of my own team.
So your position is that your team's disobEdience caused this?,That's not what I said.
"You said you didn't anticipate their defiance. You implied that all would have been fine otherwise. So who do you blame, Dr. Adams or Dr. Chase? Or both?",I don't blame either one.
"Got to move it, people.",My diagnostic test worked. It proved the Patient had a steroid-induced psychosis.
And that's what you took away from this situation?,The brain was not a symptom of an underlying disease.
Your colleague was stabbed. Are you telling me you didn't care?,How bad is it?
I can't take my finger out. He'll bleed. I don't think he can take it.,Oxygenation's at 100%. He's as ready as he's gonna be.

That'd mean the damage was perManent.,No. turns back Forget the nerves.
"House, if it's total paralysis, he must have!",Not necessarily. Think arteries. Blood flow to his spinal column is cut off. It's a clot in the radicular artery.
That could be fixable.,Prep a room for an embolectomy. Let's get that thing out of there before it does any more damage.
And if it's not a clot?,Then you can ask Foreman if hospital insurance covers ramp-vans.
Don't get too excited. We still got to get it out. Still could have done perManent damage.,Patient does not have autonomic dysregulation. There's blood in his urine bag. Kidneys are failing.
"House, not now.",Got to be now.
This will be our last round of questions. I've spoken with Dr. Chase. You know he regained movement.,No.
Are you really this indifferent to the fact that Dr. Chase is hurt?,"We're going off the record because this is irrelevant, or are you gonna hit me?"
Why don't you go tell the guy you're sorry!,I didn't do anything wrong.

This case is a fiasco. Didn't sleep last night. pause Dr. House is obviously brilliant!,"Well, I think we've heard enough."
"I know. I came to speak with Dr. House. And when they told me he was in here, I thought I should say something. I mean! he wasn't the nicest doctor I've Ever met.","Well, I think we've heard enough."
"As I was saying, Dr. House's process is dangerous, inappropriate. But he is effective. I've decided that I would be doing this hospital a disservice if I did anything to change that process.

Coward. Excuse me?,"You've got, like, 20 pages of notes there."
"You were gonna send me back to prison. House, stop.",Good things usually happen Bad things sometimes happen.

"Okay, I'm curious.",Your overreaction to your stabbing is to blame me Even as you are drawn to me. Taub's is to take moronic self-defense classes that won't defend him against anything.

"If you're not sick, then our test, accurate 99.5% of the time, yielded a false positive, three separate times. The odds of that are in 1 in 8 million.",The test is accurate. The diagnosis isn't. Sample was obviously contaminated with other foods interacting with my liver enzymes. Now could we talk about the sick Patient?
If we had a Patient file with the same symptoms you're exhibiting!,"And the symptoms I'm not exhibiting? Jaundice, ascites, fetor hepaticus."
You'd still diagnose hepatic encephalopathy. I know that because four doctors you trained have unanimously diagnosed you with hepatic encephalopathy.,Park's right. Treat the Patient with Heparin.

Are you gonna check on me?,It's gonna be at least two hours until we can tell if the Heparin's working.
Then what are you doing here?,"You know, my father taught me that it's dishonorable to interrupt someone when they're reading."
Honor's not a punch line. Get out of my room.,So was it worth it?
Justice for 34 deaths outweighs anything the Army can do to me.,They got justice? Do they know that? What if only ten people had died? Four?
Even one civilian death!,What if they just maimed a few guys? Would that have been worth it?

"Ooh, a metaphor. What you didn't foresee is that is that I actually do have a sex doll.","Your doll is your kids. Yours is your parents, yours is your charity. All excuses for not being in a relationship."
My dating is getting in the way of my dating?,You don't go looking for the right person.
"You don't go looking for the right person. You just shack up with whoEver's in the room, and then you get surprised and/or divorced when it doesn't work out. I'm surprised you haven't asked Adams out yet.",You'll bail.
He's right. The obvious solution is for me to hand my kids over to your parents.,Can we stop trying to argue the premise and move onto figuring out why it is that you're all social morons?
"You do understand the irony here. You mocking us for avoiding relationships, but you can't handle losing your doll. You're spending all this time and energy interviewing for a new one.",You're right. That is stupid. He gets up to leave.
What about the Patient?,Dude's banging a sex doll. A festering cesspool of bodily fluids and associated bacteria. Swab her out and find out which one. He leaves the office.

"It'll solve all our hang-ups. $7,000?","Adams suggests that we all sleep together, and your issue is high prices?"
Pretty sure she was joking.,"Yes, I'm 99% sure that you're right, but I would nEver forgive myself"
"Those dolls are only $5,000. He must have had it customized somehow. They all look at him in disbelief. Oh, like, you didn't check the website?",I guess we don't need to ask how your dating life is going.

Could I go with Taub? It was my idea.,Right!
Anything else you need to check? No.,I had a dream.
House! we can talk later.,"Relax, I'm a doctor. Your spectacular breasts mean nothing to me."
Later. He starts to go back inside.,I had sex with Dominika.
In a dream?,"It wasn't literally sex. Technically, it was flossing. You know, teeth, testicles. I think the symbolism is pretty clear."

So what news? They want us to come in for another interview?,No.
"Since we hadn't heard anything, II called, and they said it's gonna be a couple weeks, maybe a month till they finalize their decision. A month?","Yeah, I know. It sucks."

In the meantime! Hmm?,Have you Ever shot anyone?
"Yeah, that's the issue, not that we have no rational explanation for how the Patient spoke a language he's nEver Even heard.",I've got one.

I read in bathtub.,Better image. Thank you.
"He had the dream, and then he had the bruising.","More likely and by likely, I mean rationally it's the other way around. His brain felt the pain in his neck and created the dream to explain it."
Is it really preposterous that dreams can have physical Manifestations?,"Well, short answer is"
Thoughts during sleep can and do cause physical changes.,"Is that right, Dr. Park? Did you wake up this morning experiencing physical changes? It's medically relevant."
Her dream doesn't mean anything. Can we start acting like it doesn't mean anything?,Sure.

He was levitating.,Cool. So the one thing we know for sure is he was not levitating.
"Yes, but then I would have come into the room and reported that the Patient was weirdly arParkng his back off the bed. House grabs his cane and gets up. It was his whole body. He was levitating.","So Many questions! starting with why did Chase address his comment to someone who wasn't Even in the room? Hocus pocus, on my feet you idiots must focus."

The kid's not a magician.,Of course not.
Except he wasn't!,"Tetanus wouldn't cause that kind of breathing difficulty. And ending with! if Chase is trying not to avoid Park, why is he doing this today and not yesterday?"
"But hypocalcemia could, and the enema we administered to cure his constipation had a high phosphorous load, which could make him transiently hypocalcemic.","It's a long shot, but at least it has the benefit of being rational."
"Why not? As long as he doesn't feed the kid anything or put anything on his skin that we haven't verified is harmless, what's the pRoblem?","I agree. And since we're establishing a new policy of What the hell, we'll try anything, I'd like to hire Shakira to belly dance while singing Waka Waka."
As long as you get the mom and Shakira to consent. It's no different than having a priest or rabbi lead a prayer vigil. The mom is scared and confused and desperate for anything that'll give her hope.,True.
"And why would that make me happier? House didn't see that one coming. You're not going anywhere, and we're not ratifying their beliefs, we're respecting them.",You do realize it may involve animal sacrifice. Oops. Foreman didn't see that one. People who live in glass hospitals should not throw exorcisms.
This came in the mail today!,I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Told me what? I don't understand.,What's the letter?
"It's from my Uncle in Poland. My Aunt Luba, they put her in nursing home two months ago!",That's too bad.

He's got normal carotid pulses.,"Who cares? Mom's given up, why shouldn't I?"
"Her kid levitated. That happens to my girl, I'm expanding my diagnostic horizons.","All the more reason why we should shut down. We cure this kid now, crazy grandpa and his magic beads get all the credit."
And since when do you care about credit?,Since when do I care about this kid?
Which means he needs a coronary bypass.,It can't be Kawasaki. Echo would have shown it. But a patent ductus arteriosis
"It can't be a PDA. He's not an infant, nor has he had any symptoms for eight years.","Maybe he has. Maybe he had an infected ductus, which we inadvertently treated with antibiotics."
So no evidence is evidence of evidence?,"I'm just saying, it's consistent."
It's a billion-to-one.,Which means there's sEven people in the world who fit the diagnosis.
I thought we were looking for 100.,"Well, maybe PDA is more common than we thought. With idiot doctors like you"
"snaps at House You're wrong. calmer But the treatment's just ibuprofen. Closes the malformed duct. Worst-case scenario, he just doesn't get better","No, worst-case scenario is you piss me off"

"Comforting my husband after a bad day. She smiles and strokes his face then leans down and kisses him. He doesn't respond. He looks terrified too scared to Even breathe. If this is not what you want, I go back to making dinner.",I'm not gonna answer that.
"Oh, smart Man. after more kissing This is killing mood. She turns toward the phone, sees the caller ID and gets excited. U.S. citizenship!",I'll get it.
"gets to the phone first This is Mrs. House, please give good news, so my husband and I can go back to sex. Budmo! ! means Cheers! Is fantastic!

"I know you get confused any time someone thinks that you're wrong, but it's not considered freaking out for a Patient to ask for a second opinion.","Okay, well, here it is. Kondo is right. You should be in radiology right now."
Well done. You've kept your word for almost looking at his watch two hours.,"Every day you wait, our pal toomie is growing larger in your chest. If you want to live, stop screwing around and do something about it."
Go away. I have a headache.,coming into the office We don't have to have sex.
"coming into the office We don't have to have sex. Sometimes it's nice just to cuddle and talk. Me first. He turns to face Wilson who is now paying attention You don't want a second opinion. You're already on your fifth. You got Evans at Mercy, Shaw at County, Foster at Johns Hopkins. And Every one of them has given you the same advice. You're nuts. You don't just want chemo. You want a dose so high, there's a one-in-three chance it'll kill you outright. Question is, why didn't you tell me? Because you knew I'd stop you.

I'm thinking that the who, is you.",holding up the bag Where exactly were you planning on killing yourself? 'Cause I don't think Foreman is gonna let you do it here.
No. No! Stop. trying to explain I'm still healthy. Why not go the extreme route now when there's a better chance of surviving it?,"Statistically, this treatment has about the same chance of killing you as the thymoma does. But a hell of a lot faster."

But we found enough of this! He throws a can of the energy drink to House who grabs it. !to reanimate the entire morgue. He's jacked on caffeine.,Stimulant psychosis. How Many times do I have to solve this case?
"And that thing I said about letting you drive, I lied. What?","I'mI'm impressed. Not by that. But by your real effort to maintain the facade. It's been almost an hour, and there's been no mention of the elephant in the car."
"Well, I declined the elephant option.","Uh-huh. In three days, you're gonna find out if you live or die. You don't want to talk about it."
"No, but obviously you do.","So, we're gonna talk about it, but because I want to."
"I am neither talking about it, nor talking about not talking about it.","You are hard-wired to talk about it. It's how you cope, it's who you are."
"Yeah, well, from now on, I'm not me. I'm! I'm! Kyle Calloway.",I thought your porn name was Rusty Packard.
"Kyle is roguish, carefree, and shares no qualities with Wilson.",Can Kyle drive stick?
"Home of the Big One. House and Wilson are sitting at a table, looking at the menu.","If we had a phone, we could've found somewhere a little less charming."
"If we had a phone, you'd be making calls, downloading porn, and playing Angry Birds. This trip is about me, and I like this place.",This is not about you not wanting me to have a phone.
"I'm hungry. And an iced tea, please.",This place doesn't take credit cards.
"Uh, no. Not fine. We need to talk","Come on, you got this! You got this! Come on! A look at the clock 25 seconds left for Wilson to finish his meal."
A look at the clock 25 seconds left for Wilson to finish his meal. 25 seconds.,"You've got this. Come on, home stretch, Kyle, home stretch!"
"Come on, home stretch, Kyle, home stretch! 15 seconds!","Now, don't chew, just swallow. Just muscle it down!"
"Three, two, one!Time!","Yes! Yes! Oh, you magnificent bastard! He hugs Wilson."
"Nine years later, look what you've done with it. Ah!",Must be nice to be puking for the old-fashioned reasons.
I want a threesome.,Shouldn't we try a twosome first?
Shouldn't we try a twosome first? Two women.,Oh.
"I know they're pRobably overrated, and I'll pRobably be gravely disappointed, but I want one anyway.","No, you don't."
"Well, Kyle wants one.",Kyle's only one day old.
Kyle's only one day old. He doesn't know what he wants. I don't want to think about consequences. I don't want to think about I don't want to think about anything. I just want to! do. House gives him a resigned look.,okay. I need you to do exactly what I tell you.
This thing is peeling.,"Well, that is the cost of cowardice. Should've gone for the real thing."
I feel like I'm cheating.,"A, it is only cheating if you don't have cancer, and B, it's Wednesday afternoon."
"A, it is only cheating if you don't have cancer, and B, it's Wednesday afternoon. Pickings are slim, and more importantly, sober. The cancer cut is the surest way to the pity pooty party. He puts a baseball cap on Wilson's head. Then he looks intensively at a young Woman sitting at the bar. One down, one to go.",She's empathetic.
"One down, one to go. She's empathetic.",Gave me a cancer rate.
No. I have nEver paid for sex in my life.,You still haven't.
Bartender seems nice.,Seems female.
Want something to eat?,My friend is dying of cancer.
"Oh, you poor thing. It took my mother two years ago. But you can't give up hope. She pats him on the shoulder.","He's pretty much resigned. Just wants to go out with a bang. And another pun, what time do you get off? She smiles at them."
Apparently they left a long time ago.,"So, how was it? Was the amateur as good as the pro?"
It was confusing. Perfunctory. A bit sad.,NEver mind.
Biopsy his heart.,"Wallets go in the minibar freezer. If there's no minibar, the toilet tank. I've got exactly! He counts his money. $20 left."
"I'm sorry, I wasn't familiar with hooker protocol. We can use your credit cards.","No, we won't. I'm still on pRobation. Leaving the state without permission will really P.O. my P.O."
We have enough gas to get to Julie. I don't care about anything else. House stares at Wilson in silence. What this time?,Just wondering how long this can last.
You're still hoping that I'm gonna wake up and admit that Kyle Calloway is just some lame excuse to have some naughty thrills aren't you?,I'm actually hoping you won't. I like Kyle. He puts his cap on backwards.
"it's a funeral procession the hearse is the first of a long parade of cars. House looks at Wilson, who seems! indifferent. He puts the car in gear and speeds past the cars.",Whoo!
"Either you're right, and your friend is just really upset, or you're wrong, and he's come at this calmly and rationally, and you're about to lose a good doctor. Either way! Foreman gives him a meaningful look. Taub leaves.","This is Oubliette, Ohio. Buses don't run here after 1968."
Ina said there's a bus Every 15 minutes.,Ina is living in Alzheimersville. He looks at his watch. Been here at least half an hour.

Ben'll be wondering where his dinner is. Cab.,"Bus isn't coming, Ina. But this cab is going to Naples."
Ben'll be getting awfully hungry. House.,"We'll tell the cabbie to call the cops. They'll come pick her up, take care of her."
"Soap. It's the soap. He holds up the bottle of soap, puts it down on the counter, and exits without a word, leaving the team behind.","Oh, God, here it comes."
I had the chance to fulfill a lifelong dream.,"I swear, I will jump out of this moving bus if you don't shut up."
"But instead, I sat with a sad, old Woman for 1 1/2 hours who forgot I existed three seconds after she left. And the stupidest thing. I nEver Even had a crush on Julie Christie. House understands he won't be able to escape the situation so he turns to look at Wilson. In 12th grade I was madly in love with Melanie Robbins, who happened to look exactly like Julie Christie in Dr. Zhivago. And she really liked me. Played spades Every lunch period in Mr. Charlton's classroom. But of course, there was this other guy. A great guy. Very popular. He had a car. He had a band, a mustache!","Kyle would've ditched that sad, old Woman from the bus stop."
It's about time. Any news?,Not yet. You come here so I could talk you out of it?
I came to say thank you.,It's been fun.
It's been fun. Fun?,Sounded pithier than! We've shared a variety of situations.
Why did you let him go?,"Legal loophole. 13th Amendment. Abraham Lincoln may have looked great in that hat, but his labor policies! Suddenly, his eyes catch something on the monitor. He looks shocked."
"Legal loophole. 13th Amendment. Abraham Lincoln may have looked great in that hat, but his labor policies! Suddenly, his eyes catch something on the monitor. He looks shocked.",Come on in.
I'm not doing any more chemo.,coming back to his front door Good plan. You'll be dead in five months.
We went for a cure. It didn't work. I've thought about this a lot. Five more months on this earth is reasonable. A year in the hospital in excruciating pain is! not.,"With two weeks on, two weeks off of chemo, you'll have way more than a year, maybe two or three."
House! I'm sorry.,I'm not gonna let you just die.
"following House Hey. You know, Management research shows that the best ideas come from casual contact. House stops and turns toward Foreman So! He gives House a large envelope which reads Hockey Season Starts Now one set of season tickets. Got the seat next to you.",opening the envelope First game is October 8th. That's about one month after Wilson's expiration date. This isn't an unstructured collaboration. You're trying to be the new Wilson.
I'm trying to show you there are other people who care about you.,Relax. I'm pRobably not gonna fall apart. Foreman leaves

Head CT is clean.,How can we turn Wilson from a terminal idiot into an interminable pain in the ass?
But not his bloody nose.,My best friend is trying to kill himself.
He just wants to die with a little dignity.,There's no such thing.

Not according to his brain. indicating the monitor His temporal lobe is completely lit up. Auditory portion. He's hearing something.,Foreman's trying to date me. I assume that's because you called him.
"No, I did you! slurred put something in my coffee?",You know how you can be there for me five months from now? Don't be dead five months from now.
"Hey, Wils surveying the scene seriously?",Just a little picker-downer. I assume this unwanted interruption means you're looking for me to discuss the latest dEvelopment in the case I don't want to discuss.
He's at the right age for the onset of sParkzophrenia.,Yeah. You really need me. Ultrasound his abdomen to check for sParkzophrenia.
Tox screen was clean.,Ultrasound his dorm.
groaning Mm! Uhh!,"And lo, he is risen."
pointing to the IV pole So now my hair's gonna fall out next week?,No. All I did was temporarily kill you. How was it?
"What I don't I wasn't dead, I was unconscious.","No dreams, no thoughts. You experienced nothing. Now, imagine that without the waking up on the couch part. Just nothing times infinity."
You didn't just prove death is nothing. You proved Propofol is.,"You're saying the end is not the end? I was expecting nothing is better than something lousy, but not the angels are waiting for me."
I'm not having this conversation.,Why? 'Cause it doesn't make sense?
"Because I'm not gonna change your mind, and I don't care. More importantly, you're not gonna change mine.",There is no heaven.
"Don't know, because I don't know why it happened.",from behind him Hey. Saved us a table.
There are no tables.,I recently hacked into your old files.
speaking up from a nearby booth It's Michael now.,"Oh, yeah. This is our table."
And I'm planning on going to med school. Oh! laughing,breaking the light mood with a stern look He's going to be a doctor instead of being dead.
"Dr. House told me all about your situation. That's why I came. There's just so much good that you can do, Even in a small amount of time.","I wonder! loudly, to the whole cafeteria Hey! Is there anybody else here who's alive today because of Dr. Wilson?"
"Squamous cell lung cancer. 12 years in remission. I was able to walk my daughter down the aisle last May. Thank you, Dr. Wilson.",I did the math. 74 Parkldren are alive today because of you. 14 grandParkldren.
to the entire cafeteria Was anybody in this room really a Patient of mine?,They're somewhere. They're giving you a standing O somewhere. They exist. You saved their lives.
They're somewhere. They're giving you a standing O somewhere. They exist. You saved their lives.,calling out as Wilson leaves Its actually more impressive that they're too busy to be here.
"He's going through a rough time, but so far, he's been handling it House.",Your shoes are wet.
Glad to see your emotional turmoil hasn't dulled your powers of observation. I know you're responsible.,"No, you don't."
Friends or friend?,"Hi, this is Greg House."
Where are we going?,I just got paged to go to the bathroom. I don't know where the rest of you are going.

"Friends respect each other's decisions, Even if they don't agree with them. It's called loyalty.",Loyalty is a tool to get people to do things they don't wanna do.
"But you do want to. You may have rationalized it a hundred different ways, but the fact is, you fired me so that I'd be forced to spend the rest of my life doing exactly what I wanted to do. It was pRobably the most! selfless thing anyone has Ever done for me. And you don't Even like me that much.",I surrender. entering the office I have been a disloyal! disrespectful jerk. I should have listened to what you wanted.
I'm still not letting my parents return your call.,sitting down across from Wilson I made a reservation for two at Carmine's. Tonight. 800. No more tricks. No more Manipulations.
No more Manipulations. Said MaParkavelli.,Just! two friends enjoying the time they have left.
"two friends enjoying the time they have left. Please, don't",I'm not. I promise.
I promise. Just dinner?,That depends on how much you have to drink.

I didn't expect her to cry for quite so long.,"spotting the waiter as he approaches their table Now, I know that the tiramisu is great here, but I actually ordered off-menu."
"chuckling Great. picking up a cookie I told you, you didn't hang the bear bag high enough.",following Wilson's lead and picking up a cookie It was a smart bear. I'm almost certain he untied my knots.
"Well, he wasn't that smart. He left the Oreos behind.",You hiked for 32 miles eating nothing but creAmy filling.
The black stuff is overrated.,toasting with their Oreos To climbing the hill.
thinking Okay. If I did decide to! stick around a little longer,Don't do that to me Wilson.
"No, I'm not, I'm just I do feel pretty good and I! Maybe I should try it for a little while.",carefully I! I think that's reasonable. He takes a sip of coffee
Are you c-conning me? You're conning me.,"Wha just because you folded, that means it must be some evil plan?"
"Well, that's usually how it works with you. You drown me in nostalgia so I'll think about our friendship and feel some kind of loyalty and agree to more chemo!","That was real nostalgia. It was real emotion, a real decision."
A decision that I just made for you! he sighs,"I need you, okay? I want you to be around as long as possible. 'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do without you."

What are you doing back here?,"We got a case. Assume the status is, Patient's getting worse. You guys are confused."
"You think actually showing up for work is enough to make up for ruining an MRI, endangering the Patient, injuring us?","I got an airtight alibi, that I'm working on."
This isn't about the damage. You're back because something's going on with Wilson.,I'm done with Wilson.
You can't just abandon him.,It's in his hands now. Get any good pictures before the MRI drowned?
Enough to know it wasn't a migraine. And the Patient mistook me for Adams.,motioning toward the team Come with me.
motioning toward the team Come with me.,to Derrick Hey.
to Derrick Hey.,So what do you think's gonna happen when I stick a needle into his eardrum?
You quizzing us?,"Oh, this is a good quiz."
He'll scream in pain.,"Don't listen to her. Very small needle, very steady hand."
grimacing as House inserts the needle Ah!,"Now, when I pull back on the plunger, what do you think's gonna come out?"
"Now, when I pull back on the plunger, what do you think's gonna come out? Air.","Boy, that air sure is red."
You're being an ass.,continuing to walk down the hallway I just cured a Patient. How 'bout you?
You can't just give up on Wilson. You know he needs you. You know he's making an impossible choice. He just doesn't want to live in pain.,shouting Life is pain!

Where are you going?,You can't wait to die?
You can't wait to die?,"Here, let me help you."

Because you need me and! I don't think that's a bad thing anymore.,No.

Um! How do we start?,I'm not gonna say I love you.
"pointing And this is the peak. Almost 8,000 feet.",You do realize that my leg situation has deteriorated a little since the last time we went hiking.

Don't bother. He's dead.,You're dead too.
You might want to get up and start heading for the exit signs.,"For all I know, I already am up."

My eye's up here. points,"Orbital fracture means your face went into the windshield, which means your chest went into the steering wheel."
How'd you know?,The codeine allergy you told the nurse about.
"The codeine allergy you told the nurse about. That's shorthand for give me the strong stuff, which matches your seen-better-days-because-my-life-fell-apart suit.

But the ultrasound showed air as well as blood. Now, I know what you're thinking. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis. But I also know what I'm thinking. Doesn't explain the pneuomoperitoneum."
You ran tests yourself?,"I saw the chance to help someone in need, and I instinctively Oh, no, wait, that was someone else's instinct."
Wilson is dying. Your parole Officer is pRobably on his way here right now. How are you possibly in a good mood?,Did you nEver see Dead Poets Society? Carpe diem.
"Blah. Blah, blah.",Nobody cares about the medicine. It was a perforated ulcer. Laparotomy to find the hole in his tummy and close it up.
You didn't answer the team's question.,"Which is weird, because normally, when I talk to my own employees, I'm under oath and hooked up to a lie detector."
You were looking at six months of prison instead of five months of Wilson. Why happy?,Obviously I had a plan.
"Obviously, obviously you had a plan. The more interesting question is why you didn't tell the team. I think it's because part of you knew from the start that the plan wouldn't work.",I need a meeting.
I'm busy. Call my office.,reaParkng into his pocket Yes! because wobbly tables don't just unwobble themselves.
reaParkng into his pocket Yes! because wobbly tables don't just unwobble themselves.,I need a meeting.
When is that not true?,"Well, right now, for one."
You're asking me to perjure myself.,"It's a tiny, white lie."
Felony vandalism should have added another year or two to your sentence. It's a miracle the parole board agreed to six months.,"serious I will go to jail, Eventually. I will pay the price. I just rather that Wilson didn't. Come on, be a friend."
Be a friend?,How Many fingers am I holding up?
Why do you want to kill yourself?,"Well, here's a reason."
You think that's the sum total of who you are? A doctor? A friend to Wilson?,I'm also a tremendous baritone. Now go away.
Stop being an idiot.,"Can I have Kutner back, please?"
How much pathetic wallowing do I have to sit through?,How are things in hell? Is the humidity the big issue?
What happened next with the guy's medical case?,Why?
"Exactly. Why am I, meaning you, still obsessing about this case? Obviously we think it's relevant to why we're still sitting on the floor of a burning building.",There was a code.
What are you doing? What did you give him?,Five! four! three! two!
his eyes pop open and he flails at the doctors Ahhh! Arg!! Ahhh!,"Naloxone. We should've got suspicious when his visiting cousin signed in as Mr. Tar H. Horse. Heroin caused the respiratory distress. The naloxone turned off the receptors, caused your distress."
shouting I'm not gonna stop doing drugs! It's reality that sucks!,You're saying I'm lying! to my subconscious?
"People do it all the time. And like it or not, you are a person.",He said Every one of those things.
"But not then and not like that. This guy was going nuts from the naloxone. He couldn't be rational if you wanted him to be, which you did. Why?",I compressed the story a little
"jttpgyix matters. You nEver talk to Patients for non-diagnostic reasons, but this guy!",Feeling better?
I'm not gonna stop doing drugs.,"You were a stockbroker. Son of a stockbroker. Married, Parkldren."
I was miserable.,"Well, you say you were miserable because you need to rationalize screwing it up."
"Except I didn't. I mean, I-I did. But I'm not miserable. Not anymore. House, fascinated, studies Oliver's faces as he talks. I had a ski injury and painkillers weren't enough, and a friend of mine gave me some heroin. The second it entered my veins, it was like! God had taken over my body. It was like there was no more pain or unhappiness in my life or anybody else's.",But then you lost Everything.
Are you arguing that he's a good role model?,He's happy.
You're stealing this guy's oxygen?,There's oxygen Everywhere.
"You passed on all your cases, reassigned them to other doctors.",They weren't interesting.
They were my reason for getting your sentence delayed!,"Yeah, well, I guess you'll have to tell the parole board something else."
You set me up.,Not really.
Why are you doing this? Why are you risking destroying yourself?,There's no risk. I know you. You'll do the honest thing. You'll lie.
You'll lie. No.,He's happy.
You weren't worried.,Of course I was worried. My plan fell through.
"The plan didn't matter. Your plan to replace that plan didn't matter. Wilson didn't matter. Jail didn't matter. The only thing that mattered, the only thing that Ever mattered, was the puzzle.","I noticed a slight twitch in his thenar eminence, which meant! to Oliver You're dying."
Because my thumb's a little shaky?,"Plus the thinning in the muscle, plus that speech you gave at Yankee Stadium saying you were the luckiest Man on the face of the earth."

Wait. Now you're standing at the door. What happened in the meantime?,"And lo, there was a miraculous wonder I walked across the room."
"No, you just skipped over a chunk of conversation.","He swore that he would live a better and more selfless life in his remaining time, blah, blah, blah. After two blahs, I'd heard enough. I moved to the door."
"No, you're avoiding it.",Do you smell smoke?
accepting his reason for editing his report Fair enough.,to Oliver You're not symmetrical. The veins on your right side are distended.
What does that mean?,examining Oliver's neck There's a bulge in your superclavicular notch. There's something in there.
There's something in there. What?,"Well, I'm not that good a doctor. pulls over an ultrasound maParkne and checks Oliver's neck Good news your case is fascinating. And good news for you you're gonna live."

And good news for you you're gonna live.","voice over You've inhaled a small branch, pRobably while you were realizing that it's all worth it, while you were passed out on a Park bench."
voice over And it grew?,"voice over Not unless you also inhaled a chunk of the sun and a drip-irrigation system, you idiot."
"Taub holds up a small piece of a fir branch, including the needles. You're smiling.","I was, and now I'm not. Because a moment's fun a few days ago does not trump a friend dying."
"staring down at him Yeah, it does, you idiot. 'Cause after he's dead, you cry for a while, and then you go back to doing what you love.","Every Patient that I've had, 70 years from now, they'll all be as dead as Wilson. Everybody dies. It's meaningless."
"What about God? You were leaving, and then you stopped. Why?","Your theory is I'm not leaving, because I beliEve in God? What, he's calling me home?"
Maybe falling through that floor was a sign. Maybe that the universe hates you. Something. You really don't beliEve? Really? Not in some deep crack of some remote recess of some dark corner of your mind?,No. Except that some deep crack of some remote recess of some dark corner is here telling me
"That's enough. In a burning building, facing imminent death, that's more than enough.",Pascal's wager is facile.
"Saying it's facile is facile. Why is it wrong? He stares at her. Don't be logical, be desperate. You gotta have something to hold on to.",You can't live your life based on something you don't beliEve.
But you can end your life based on something you don't beliEve? What about love? I lived with you for years. I know you beliEve in love.,"Foreman wouldn't help me, which means I need you to take the fall."
"You do remember I'm dying, right?","Which is you will nEver spend a day in jail. Fresh-faced, cancer-ridden. It's tough to do both, but you pull it off."
Your fingerprints are all over those hockey tickets.,I nEver admitted to flushing anything. My prints make sense if I gave those tickets to you as an incentive to stay alive.
"And I was so angry that you didn't respect my dying wishes, I took thousands of dollars of season tickets and flushed them down toilets?",All you have to do is create reasonable doubt.
"Great, what if I do more than that? What if I end up in jail? Or spending my final months in endless hearings?",That is a risk you are willing to take.
I have a reputation. I have a legacy that could,sincerely Wilson! I don't want to lose this time with you.
I don't want to lose this time with you. Okay.,Thanks. I knew I could count on you.
I knew I could count on you. Wait! Wait.,"stops, mouth full You want the fries back?"
I'm not gonna take the fall.,"Don't do this to me, Wilson. This is our only option."
"Exactly, because you overplayed your hand with Foreman, because you knew you had me as a backstop. Even with me dying, you-you just assumed I'd be here to bail you out.","Since you're here, and you are bailing me out, it seems like a pretty safe assumption."
"Hey! I won't be here soon. If I do this, I'm teaParkng you that your bad behavior will always be rewarded. You need to learn","How to act when you're gone? 'Cause if that's the lesson, we got a really great opportunity coming up."
"You'll just try to find someone else, and it won't work, and it shouldn't work!",So that's the great wisdom you're imparting? That I'll always be alone?
There's only one person you can count on.,"pause, quietly I thought there were two."
