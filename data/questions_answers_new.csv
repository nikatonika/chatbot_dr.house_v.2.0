interrupts This guy's supposed to have universal power over all of gravity how come his hair won't stay down? That's just stupid.,Hard to beliEve that one Patient could slip past Cuddy and get herself admitted with a sprained wrist. Two seems almost impossible - what room?
Neck pain could be a symptom for bone cancer.,You up to Bs? Well done!
I made it a question just because it's more polite. You got a big Keep Out sign stapled on your forehead.,"That explains it, I told them to put it on my door."
If Everyone took a pay cut and put in a few more hours we could all stay for the same amount of money.,"Figures you'd try and come up with a solution where no one gets hurt. The pRoblem is, the world doesn't work that way just cause you want it to."
She's a court reporter.,"Uh-huh, well I'm sure Thailand will have courts any day now. Someone's going to be miserable sometime. Accept it. It's how I stay so happy."
"Brave kid, she Even gave her mom a pep talk.",Sure. Brave. She's a wonder.
"Yeah, I do. Chase, walk with me.",Great contributions back there.

shocked You're... you're saying we should kill one son to save the other?,Nick is gonna die either way.
She doesn't speak English. Shhhh!,"Ow! Ow! ah! ah!. oh, my God. Woman looks happy. And if Wilson's looks could take people's clothes off, this show wouldn't be TV-14. Bueno."
Do you think they pray to Him and praise Him because they want Him to know how great He is? God already knows that.,"Are you comparing me to God? I mean, that's great, but just so you know, I've nEver made a tree."
getting up to leave Let me know when Cameron says yes to cutting off our Patient's skull. I'll be doing the endoscopic ultrasound.,"Good news. He comes the rest of the way in. I don't need your approval for some crazy, unproven treatment. I just need to do a test."
Which means there's nothing physically wrong with this kid.,We already had that discussion. Did we get a fecal smear? He purposely says the last bit louder to ick out the people in the clinic.
reading Wilson's paper Euthanasia let's tell the truth. We all do it. We just don't talk about it. We play the game. We use other words or we don't use any words at all.,Hmm. Nice phrasing.
I can't serve you.,"This cause I'm black? Cause I'm not, so!"
What makes you think I haven't already?,To be continued. I need to brilliantly cure a Patient.
What's in this? Just soda.,Mind if I have some?
You saying the CT was wrong?,I'm saying the symptoms don't add up.
"mimics him, then You've still got to cover Q-Z.","Sorry I'm late, I was taking a dump."
...Yeah. he sinks down on the couch. So the image that we saw on the ultrasound,"Was obviously just a pocket of air, like I said all along."
He's done six already.,Figured you might be getting backed up. The holiday season and all.
"Sits down in front of Greta. Okay, hold still. While using the stethoscope to listen to her lungs he starts gently tapping her chest.","Auscultatory percussion. If you have a good ear, you can... Listens. To 13. You didn't have a lot of friends because you chose..."
"Doctor House, It's all my fault. What do you think?",Here we go!.
"But what about her back? Look. He replays part of the DVD Right before the collapse, she hit the small of her back on the railing. Damaged adrenal glands caused adrenal insufficiencies, which caused the collapse.",Nice.
We've got to go with the four out of six donors.,"Hmm. Did I mention my concerns about four being less than six? Wilson's first wife ignored a similar issue. Of course, that time, it was only fatal to their marriage."
You're an idiot. She walks out of the office,"Well, either you can go after her and try and patch things up, or you blow her off and take your old job back."
"You can pretend you wanted me to lie, but you didn't. You want the people on your team to challenge you otherwise you'd just be a bully instead of a great doctor. You hired me because I don't compromise my principals.",Or I want a front row seat when you wake up and realize how useless your principals are.
Why don't you just ask him?,Yelling. I haven't peed in three days!
It was his idea to take our name.,Then you should have said no.

You want to treat her? She's a nut job.,Don't we all have quirks? Aren't those eccentricities what make us huMan?
"Look, my girl's more important.","frustrated and annoyed She's not your girl, you idiot."
"It's TB, and I'm not dying. I'm going to want you to plan a PPD and induce sputum to confirm the TB. House nods to Chase and Foreman, who stand up. Sebastian follows. Imaging studies will determine the progress, and I think we should pRobably take a CT-scan of my lungs just so that nobody second-guesses us?",Wouldn't want that. Sebastian's cell rings. He answers it.
"For he himself has said it, and it's greatly to his credit, that he is an EnglishMan. He i-i-i-i-is an EnglishMan.",Get it while it's hot.
Sayonara! It's Cuddy.,I already put him on the psittacosis meds. Soon as you left. You're welcome.
"That's hard to beliEve, since you're currently shtupping her. She turns back to a stunned, speechless House.",We have a situation.
"I'm clean. I'm raising two kids. It'd be pretty irresponsible, wouldn't it?",But confiding it in eight-year-olds is okay.
"A Judge at the campus pool center collapsed, LP rEvealed a virulent form of bacterial meningitis.","Great, got it diagnosed, you don't need me."
You make her angry.,You really think that was the best time to mock me?
It's nothing. Do not defend him.,Why did he sign that DNR?
at House's desk Yep. Boyfriend has gonorrhea.,And Everyone's a winner.
If you have a personal issue that's interfering with--,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."

"You've done this before, right?",Successfully?

So you don't think they have a right to know?,getting up from the couch Two more babies have come down with symptoms.
"You know, it's kind of hard to think when you're in our face like this",Yeah? You think it's going to be easier when you've got a real Patient really dying? to Everyone What are you missing?
What's going on? Cam takes her pulse.,This better be important.
"Postpartum psychosis makes her want to drown her kid, the internal conflict triggers a seizure.",You know what else might be a trigger?
Mesothelioma shouldn't grow this fast.,Good rephrasing. Have Wilson do a biopsy to confirm.
"The question isn't what, it's why.","Oh, get a room."
Yes. I like helping people. I get a rush when I see the look on their faces when they realize their burdens are gone.,Hmm... but you make sure you're in the next state by the time the endorphins wear off and the arthritis comes back.
"They're not suing, but I think only because Chase asked them.",Why does Everyone always think I'm being sarcastic?
Then you're just a moron! Biopsy me!,"Only if this thing hits your brain, you moron! I can't stress that moron thing enough. You're killing your wife!"
"Ugh, damn, do you have a Kleenex?","I got a sleEve. I got two, actually."

to House This is a good hospital?,Depends what you mean by good. I like these chairs. back to paper
"I did. Unfortunately, the Patuxent River Naval Air Station was GPS testing and disrupted the signal, at the exact same 45 minutes you weren't here.","Well, if I'd known I had 45 minutes of freedom, I'd have gone hang gliding."
epiphany Anybody have Taub's pager number? What's up?,"Maybe give him a call. If he tosses that switch on the MRI, she's dead. X-ray her brain."
James was right. I nEver had the teeniest chance of selling you anything.,Of course he was right. He doesn't stop giving good advice just because you're divorced. He's compulsive about remaining on good terms with his exes.
I'll get my shoes. Turns to walk away but stops. So we don't need to talk about...,No.
Three reported concussions. These guys are taught in high school how to dupe the tests.,Guilt?

What brings you to the hospital? My wrist.,How did that happen?
Doesn't mean she's not hot.,Just means she can't bend over. So Cuddy has to bend over backward.

"to Foreman and Thirteen Go have sex. No, thanks.","Fine, I'll cover the Viagra and the lubricants. Just get me a receipt."
"Doctor House, I need to talk with you, Dr. House. Sister Augustine beliEves in things that aren't real. What do you think?",I thought that was a job requirement for you people.
She's my mother!,Step.
reaParkng between the pillows on the bed Um...,This... This is yours. He pulls out another one.
"This isn't a job interview, is it?","It's some kind of interview. You're judging me, I'm judging you."
What type of work? I'm tired.,I eat out a lot. In a lot of restaurants. Opens the box starts pulling out receipts. Knotty Pine. RitParkes.
It's not about looking good. People are always hiding things. I just keep shooting until I can see what's really inside them. My eyes okay?,Eyes are gorgeous. Vessels don't look so hot. Micro-aneurysms predict further strokes.
Some more Pinot Grigio?,"pulling out a menu Uh, no. Think I will switch to the... Syrah!"
"nods Steroids to treat, brain angiogram to confirm, EMG and nerve biopsy while you're at it. I'll be at lunch.","to Wilson I'd hire all four, but a five-person team seems unwieldy. Who would you turn down? to cashier I'll have whatEver he's buying."
"This isn't a soap opera, House. People don't just wake up from comas the second you give them drugs.",Especially if we give them the wrong drugs. What'd the tests say?
He's too old for that,"So what would be just right, Goldilocks?"

Hey. Your turn to pick.,"Ready, set, feed the monkey!"
You don't know how Patrick's brain reorganized itself twenty-five years ago?,looking at a model of a brain What if the right side... is just a little dead. Maybe he has random neurons firing.
I got a new job and I moved.,See how crappy that worked out?
incredulous She called her mom a slut?,"No, I called her mom a slut. Jumps anything with a pole and a pulse. Not that I'm judging here. Given her medical history, I'm actually impressed."
Yeah. What's up?,You like me. Why?
Which means her lungs are fine.,What if the clear arteriogram is significant?
"He's in ICU, systolic is hovering around 170, I left instructions to lower it slowly so we don't risk hypoperfusing his organs.","Tradeoff being that leaving his blood pressure that high risks stroke, MI, and blindness."
"Cancer, infectious disease, the big devils. I think that medicine has become too institutionalized. We need to send a message to our Patients that we're just like them. I mean, we're all people.","We're all people. I like that. She's all hard science, facts. I like to know a person's hopes and dreams. What kind of music do you like, Patrick?"

"You wouldn't take them! You'd rather OD on Vicodin or stick electrodes in your head, because you can say you did it to get high. The only reason to take antidepressants is because you're depressed. You! you have to admit that you're depressed.",Give me. Holds out his hand.
You okay with an answer based on evolution? uncertainly Yeah.,Hypocrite.
He! is a person.,"Thanks for playing along. Pretend that it's a one-pound adult. Forget the mom, forget the womb, the placenta. How would we get a better look at what's in the lungs?"
We've been alone all night.,"No, I mean Amber. She's gone."
Nope! But it is keeping my piano lEvel.,"So... where is the poor, sick fella?"
You're really gonna take a stand here. You can't say,Nope.

"If night comes, you'll be thanking me. pointing outside They're seeking heat.",He's an accountant. How late do you think he's going to party?
H-how do you expect me to respond to this stuff?,Exactly like you just did. I have a theory. Maybe you can help me out. Black Mormon means masoParkst. Means kinky.
"No. House, clear.",Right. steps back
"Yeah, that's the issue, not that we have no rational explanation for how the Patient spoke a language he's nEver Even heard.",I've got one.
There's no way he said that.,"Sighs. No, but it's true. He resents you for being able to walk. Been there. I resented you for hell of a long time."
So you think it's all too perfect? Some other disease is trying to throw us off its trail?,"If he had four out of twenty possible symptoms, he'd be a garden-variety druggie. Twenty out of twenty, there's an underlying disease. to the Fellows Run your tests."

Complication on a complication?,Body's doing the opposite of what it's supposed to. Her body's Wilson. How do we respond to that?
"after a few seconds He's not gonna run the tests, is he?",No.
"Step back, Dr. House. House uncovers the body, still oozing blood, and starts examining it, but is bothered by his gloves.",It's kind of hard to do an autopsy in oven mitts.
You could ask House to be a grown-up and respect my decision.,"I respect things that deserve respect. This decision, on the other hand, is a dog wearing a cape!"
You knew she was stealing meds?,No. But have you seen the way she opens the mail?
I'll be sure to let my wife know.,"Oh, don't bother yourself, the state will call for you."
"There's nothing here. Just the usual cracked heads, gunshots, false alarms.",Who'd you pick to fill your narrow little flats?
You don't have the cleavage for it.,But I have a much tighter ass.

What happened to Everybody lies?,I was lying.
Really? Cause it looks like it's still in this pair.,Get your hands off me.
"Yeah, drugs and alcohol don't do that.","And that note that he says is out of tune, it's not, which means that something is screwing with his aural perception, too."

It's possible to think he's allergic to both anti,"Oh, I'm sorry! Not you. Understandable mistake. The other Dr. Chase. Chase is not amused."
"I'm not doing this at all. If there were something to be done, I would have done it in the year he spent dying. He checks his pockets. You took my Vicodin? I'm in pain. Wilson pulls the Vicodin bottle from his inside pocket, opens it and gives House a pill, all without looking at him. One? So the Vicodin is my leash. One'll take the edge off, but it won't give me enough relief for an escape back to Plainsboro. He swallows it.",Where's my phone? Wilson ignores him. It's the team. It's their ring tone. nothing Forget it. The Patient's blood is on your hands.
You think I'm not good enough for your mother.,"Not in front of the kids, Honey."

I gotta go out. Why?,Wilson's got a date.

"She told her co-worker, she told her kid.",She lied to the world. Reconstructive surgery is designed to convince people that

Don't think so.,"Daddy thinks so. Could be mistaken, said he was drunk, could be some other daughter."
"And if it is acute intermittent porphyria, that would explain why his symptoms keep recurring.",It's unlikely! but it's possible. What else? Nobody says a thing I said what else?
Sighs. I'll do it.,I know. Walks to his office.
"Three, two, one!Time!","Yes! Yes! Oh, you magnificent bastard! He hugs Wilson."
"Oh, I see! So you hate him because the lives he saves aren't as good as the lives you save.","Yup, that's the reason. Nobel invented dynamite. I won't accept his blood money."
What took you so long? It's midnight.,Traffic. Cinco de Mayo. To Foreman. You owe me a 100 bucks.
"That means that something she did at my place set this off. Either she brought drugs in, or she grabbed something from my medicine cabinet. And that means my place needs to be searched. Now, I'd be happy to do that myself, but unfortunately that would be far less titillating for House, so he's about to come up with some convoluted medical reason why I have to stay here while he goes through my stuff.",Patient's dad had bypass surgery. Means she's a candidate for atherosclerosis. She needs an ultrasound. That was much less convoluted than what you just said.
Mind if I take a look in your purse? Why?,Because I'm going to need to search it and you for whatEver you're using to poison your husband.
"I'm sure it's very interesting. I didn't read any studies. I just raised Parkldren. Wilson shakes his fork, nervously, then his head. Arlen turns to Cuddy. It's not your fault.

Hmm. See you.,You can do this.
You can stop. She ruined it.,"Three rules for hunting fungus. Location, location, location."
"Not really, Cuddy won't...",I can make you miserable.
How is that a habit? You plan on getting trapped under a building again?,I don't beliEve in God.
The nurse said I might only have a day or two left.,She was being kind.
"On the other hand, Taub and Thirteen can do the liver biopsy today. Why us?",Juniority. Welcome back.
What are you talking about?,"If I'd pitched electroshock therapy as a cure for broken heart syndrome any other time, you'd have dug in and maybe tried another 100 useless things first."
My diagnosis. I don't know what he has.,Cancel the surgery.
"I'm just saying, if you wanna do it, do it while her B12 is still low. Guilt can be your friend. they walk down the hall Breakfast?",Yeah.
It's really not P.O.T.S. We're really back to square one.,"So what's masquerading as a stroke? Voted the worst Halloween costume, by the way."
Perfectly round. Now Hep C would explain--,"Question was nEver is it Hep C? Question was given that it's not Hep C, what is it?"
It also says something that you lied to me about getting the charges dropped!,I got a Lawyer. He cut a deal. You didn't call the guy? You have to show up at the arraignment. Everybody knows that.

Dr. House? How's he doing?,looking in again NEver better.
I am not exposing myself without some reciprocity.,"It's my apartment, it's not my soul. Cate just sits there. Picks up the laptop and points it towards the room. Living room."
You don't already know?,"Yeah, he's at home in a fight with his wife. I'm just curious what he wanted me to know."
"Doctor House, I'm just waiting for the surgery. What do you think?","Yeah well, go scrub in."
Chase is a good doctor.,"Sorry, you're in the wrong room. My name on the door, my team, my decisions."
We're finding another match. And how do you know?,What other pRoblem could there be with a pRoblem-free procedure?
To House. You?,Working girls are sticklers. You're not going to poll Chase? She looks at him sharply.
It's pneumonia. He wanted to go home. I thought he was lying. I told him I had a dinner party. I made him go up there.,"Well, why didn't you just take out a gun and shoot him?"

Could be pulmonary edema from renal failure.,Pulmonary edema doesn't give you hives.
Okay. So I went a little heavy on the Vicodin.,We're both in my head. You'd think one of us would have noticed the blood.

Just open up. Trust.,Strangers?
"sitting, happy I have sEventeen points?",I started you all out on a hundred. And you blew up part of the building.

"You're joking, right?",Mostly.
I forgot Wednesday was hooker day. This could've waited!,You make me meet you at your House. Your husband is conveniently absent.

I was trying to save his life.,"Yeah, your heart was in the right place."
You want him to feel like a piece of crap?,"No, I don't want him going home."
"No, but there are other doctors in this hospital, and other Patients.",That helps explain how they can afford all the fancy equipment. I'm sure not pulling my weight.

You got it.,"to Wilson You need to stop Matty's meds. The marrow rebounds, it's the meds. If it doesn't, it's an infection."

Woah grabs House's cane,I'm thirsty.
But which one? No one she knows is sick. She hasn't traveled anywhere. There's nothing in the history she gave us. Nothing in her blog.,There has to be something unique to this infection. Something about its transmission and the way it Manifests. There has to be something she's not telling us.

I have no idea.,"Our Patient can either go through life with the world's longest umbilical cord, or we can discuss the differential for magic blood."

You erased my messages?,Yup! Decided I wanted you to stay. Told you that didn't I? he continues talking to Wilson while he pees
"Give it up. Foreman and Cameron are too ethical, and I'm too scared of getting sued.","Fine. Now I'm just going to find someplace safe to hide this, where I won't be tempted to use it."
"There's nothing Engine revs again, Foreman gives up and stops speaking and House stops revving the engine. Everyone including Wilson starts to smile, Foreman tries again There's nothing else we can do.",You checked the police report?
I am flattered you would consider me this bold and brilliant.,"Yeah, it takes a cr!"

"Doctor House, Take the cardiac arrest out of the equation!. What do you think?",All the rest of the symptoms can be explained by a sEvere long-term allergic reaction.
So why did we do the test.,Because if it had been positive it would have proved I was right.

"Yeah, that works.",What did we miss?
CT was clean for tumors and kidney stones.,to Kutner I thought Amber scared you guys.

"Stop, you're embarrassing me.",But I want Vogler to think I think it's you.
I've been busy. Excessive prescribing.,Not that busy. I know that you pled down to excessive prescribing. The question was what did you DO?

"Well, I'm just not arrogant enough to think that of the 50 billion galaxies, 100 billion stars per galaxy, and 10 million billion planets in the universe that we're the only ones with life.",No. But I'm guessing we're the only ones who like shoving things through our back doors.
Did you really think I was gonna leave you stuck back here for eighteen hours?,"Go on, enjoy. With the Vicodin and the wine, I can sleep anywhere."
"Well, what is it?",Not a symptom. House leaves
Thanks. The treatment indiCate--,"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were in the middle of something."
She's saving her Parkld. Cameron would point out that people are capable of sacrifice.,Cameron isn't here.
I just did.,"No, you didn't."
Must be another reason why I'm here.,Yes.
"Oi, where'd you find that",The Journal de Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical. You don't read Portuguese?
Alcoholism. We should search his home and locker room.,Note that the person who wants to search the home didn't sleep in one last night. You have the imprint of a seatbelt buckle in your cheek.
"Foreman told me you're ablating the Patient's marrow, on a non-theory that Foreman himself withdrew. You're gonna kill the Patient. Is this about me and Lucas? He looks at her and leaves. She follows. I want alternatives for the Patient.",So do I.
Each brain with OCD has its own way of filtering it. Some people wash their hands and hoard TV Guides. You do puzzles and hoard memories.,So what we thought was a gift! is just you literally obsessing over your own life.
Not you. Foreman's department.,"Oh, right. Well, he's got all the time in the world."
"It could mess with his brain, it wouldn't cause fEver. looking at Jack He's been sleeping a lot lately.","You worried? I marked a change of meds on his chart. and back to Vince Foreign object, body wants to get rid of it, causes the fEver."
Are you sure you want to be doing this?,"I'm fine, I think. Cameron, you got my records?"
Do you want to fire me?,Yes. I was just waiting for an excuse. Thank God Vogler came along. Phew!
Gale here on the other hand-- Amy.,"WhatEver. You're mad at me, fine I get that, take it out on me, not on her."
"talking quietly and quickly Okay, yes, you're right, about Everything. But please, House. Don't tell her.","Hi, Rachel."
I got out of the back of the building. The body,Just switched the dental records.
We screwed up.,"No, you did exactly what his attending did."
It'd be too hard to get the prednisone concentrations right. No one fixes anything unless they have a compelling reason.,"If we're gonna treat, we have to give him a compelling reason, something that he wants more than an interview. loudly Fire in the hole!"
"Holds up a book. Happiness is possible. Amber and Wilson arrive. And not just in this life, but in the next...","Oh, you're selling religion. I'm sorry, I bought some Islam yesterday. Lets Amber and Wilson in."
"House She stops short as she sees House laughing and pouring shots. I was just waiting for test results, I was!",Little busy right now. Getting my drink on.
"Actually, I'm responsible for that. He's walking down a street, looking for an address he has on a piece of paper. Spiked his water bottle with nitrates, dropped his blood pressure, Robbed oxygen-rich blood from his brain, making him blind. Figured a temporarily blind Patient is better than a perManently dead one. Vision was already coming back by the time I dropped him off at the hospital.","Well played. If only we could combine your medical Parkcanery with your brother's ability to fetch me mochas, you'd be the perfect Foreman. Where are you?"
"What I don't I wasn't dead, I was unconscious.","No dreams, no thoughts. You experienced nothing. Now, imagine that without the waking up on the couch part. Just nothing times infinity."
"I know that limp. I know the empty ring finger. And that obsessive nature of yours, that's a big secret. You don't risk jail and your career just to save somebody who doesn't want to be saved unless you got something, anything, one thing. The reason normal people got wives and kids and hobbies, whatEver. That's because they don't got that one thing that hits them that hard and that true. I got music, you got this. The thing you think about all the time, the thing that keeps you south of normal. Yeah, makes us great, makes us the best. All we miss out on is Everything else. No Woman waiting at home after work with the drink and the kiss, that ain't gonna happen for us.",That's why God made microwaves.
"Here's my theory you're jealous. He's maturing, he's accepting responsibility, you're emotionally stuck at sEventeen.","He's Manufacturing responsibility, he's not maturing. He hasn't changed at all."
He shouldn't have broken your nose.,"You know, texts, calls, and emails all go to the same magic device these days. You only got to send one."
"He washed them this morning, right? What?",Nice respectful Asian kid does the laundry.
"over PA system Thank you and, as always, have a pleasant flight.",Still feel like puking?
Patient's scheduled for irradiation at nine. Sits down. You risked your life AGAIN. You couldn't be sure he had Amyloidosis.,You can't be sure that I couldn't be sure.

"No, the dialysate composition was within range. looks at the name on his slip of paper, giving a nod and smiling to himself Sweet.",Interesting.
Then you have tests indicating,Nope.
You haven't changed. Heard about your leg.,"Yeah, pulled a hamstring playing Twister. Just gonna walk it off. So, who's the girl?"
Does it matter?,I don't know. You're the one who brought it up. holds out his left arm and puts a strap over it Tie this off.
"The lord is my shepherd, I shall not want!",quietly to Wilson I am not talking We were strangers who shared some geography 30 years ago.
Nice lipstick. Thank you.,Bad idea.
It fits the symptoms perfectly.,It's certainly one possibility. What about the aspergillus fungus we found under the sink?
You read Cameron's version?,I didn't read either.
"Don't do that. Let's just... See how it goes. Marcus nods slightly. So, uh, do they Mandate you to stay here at the halfway House? Or! can you come stay with family?",It's Foreman.
Oh. I thought you were too sick to be down here.,"Had to get away from those students so I faked a page. flips through file Foreman's parents, happily married, 40 years."
I read about them on the internet.,"So, what'd you search for? Diseases from Asia that don't match my son's symptoms? You heard about them in Asia."
He was being treated with polystyrene. Polystyrene shouldn't--,It didn't. Question is what do they use in the NICU to bind it together?
What's the challenge?,We can all applaud the doctor who's willing to break all the rules.
Haha. Shakes his head... Well I can't give you my prescription. You've got to meet with a psyParkatrist. You need a whole work up. Breathing heavily. Give me a Vicodin so I don't stroke. House chucks him the bottle. Wilson pops a pill. And grabs a coffee cup off the side table.,I! wouldn't drink that. Wilson stares at him. My leg hurt and I! points towards the bathroom. Wilson puts the cup down.
It was your freaked-out overprotectiveness that nearly killed him. Nearly?,"He's young. A few weeks of dialysis, he should be fine."
"It means, we still don't know what's wrong with you. Thank you.",Do you know if that! O.R. nurse that Wilson liked Ever broke up with her boyfriend?
Of course I am. It couldn't possibly be that I think he's right and I'd like to be a small part of what he's doing.,"Oh, whores can like the sex. Doesn't mean they're not whores. And with that eye shadow! I am totally screwed, aren't I?"
ignores him and hands him the meds Medication time.,Sarcastically You are a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day.
Why did you hire me?,Does it matter?
"Actually, looks like you.","Yeah, that's Grandpa House. Tell him to call back on a land line. Terrible reception in here. How much pain was your mom in?"
She asked me to kiss her.,"I rest my case. A regular nine year old girl does not have sex on the brain, not when a doctor is threading a catheter through her vein."
Amy is just getting over it. She barely spoke to her mom for months and if she thought that it was happening again and that's why I got sick... he grimaces in pain as House jabs in the needle We... we just happened to be at the same Italian cheese-tasting thing.,Cheese is the devil's plaything.
Beg your pardon.,Swoft.
Then why are you--,Advocating for my Patient. I gotta go clinic duty. I need you to get me the files on Everybody who dies here today.
He doesn't. What's wrong with her?,Sorry. I'm sure she's got a medical crisis. And I need more time to figure out some leading questions for your wife.
"Yes, I do.","Well, then do something."
"Pete Best was actually a great drummer, but I assume you mean the Patient needs a cardiac sympathectomy?","PRobably should have just said that, huh?"
Sounds good. Like a!date?,"Exactly. Except for the date part. She stares at him, shocked speechless. He turns away quickly, embarrassed. Forget it. starts to walk to the computer desk"
Your case is no more urgent than mine.,"pushing through the doors of the surgical suite Yeah, but you're way more Patient."
Her breasts are really tender.,You guys have a hot tub?
"What, you're going to get involved now?",I'm not involved. Guy brought his son into the clinic.
"Stop. Moves 13 out of the way with his cane and turns to look at the group. Okay. Here's how we diagnose in transit. I lead, you draft, I move, you move, I stop, you stop. Got it?","Wait a sec, why did you do the test? I gave it to Scooter."
You need to call someone.,There's no time. Get a syringe and a needle.
After you were already proven wrong?,Good for you.
"We're not talking about my brother anymore, are we?",It's House. AVMs don't explain his glucose.
Already did. It's not working.,to him Feeling guilty?
"Honey, your dad is dead. He's not going to care. Do you know what you're going to say?",I don't know. Just let the minister or one of his buddies from the corps!
Tattletale! You cheated!,"I cheated then, you're cheating now! Your drug doesn't work."
"Oh, hi. I'm here to apologize. I could have handled the news with more! aplomb? I have a son. That's great news.",What else did she tell you to say?
Love. pause. He looks up. You didn't see love.,Wow. I didn't think you'd take my lack of board game skills so personally.
"She was a cop. Shot a kid in self defense, nEver got over the guilt, started taking drugs, and got busted.",Way to bury the lead. How long ago was the shooting?
No. House walks away.,Wait a second.
You're still in that thing.,What thing? Oh this? Forgot it was Even there.
"Dr. House, you have a Patient in Room One.","Thank God. He walks off, but turns around. People pray so that God won't crush them like bugs. I'm not gonna crush you."
And there's no way to predict when he'll have another attack.,Sure there is.
"Well... umm, I usually sleep in a hyperbaric chAmber. I've been pumping up electrolytes with an IV drip and herbal supplements, amphetamines, and diuretics","Yeah yeah yeah yeah, but why would you be sick?"
Her leg looks fine.,Weird huh?
How's it going?,Great. The only way he could turn any more cheeks is by pulling down his pants.
And you feel good about that? Yes.,So I'm hiring an idiot.
"Which makes sense, she's obviously an adult, capable of her own well-reasoned decisions. You're sure?","If she doesn't die in the next couple of hours, yeah, I'm right."
"I wanted to give you the Serpent Staff with the poison axe head, but I left it in my car.",seeing Foreman Don't need you.
You'll lie. No.,He's happy.
He just started spiking a fEver.,It's scleroderma.
The Patient is not too thrilled with me.,I'll get her consent.
"If lying to a Patient saved their life, would you do it? No.","That's a lie. If your grandma gave you a really crappy tea cozy for Christmas, would you tell her you liked it?"
"He went to an HIV clinic last week. Tested negative for TB, PCP, MAC, CMV, HSV. It's not an infection.","HIV clinic. So few Patients, so much money Sorts his mail. re-do the tests."
That wasn't the deal.,The contract clearly stated no takesy backsides.
"Comes barging in. House, I got the...","It can wait. To Cuddy, I will sign, if you will give us a ruling."
Her brain's fine. She's faking?,She's got post traumatic stress disorder.

I'm not going to change my mind! No more tests! God knows the way.,"Walking in. Ok, let's start with the shirt. Wilson walks in behind him."
Take your time.,acting like a beliEver Is my grandfather still here?
"How could that surprise you? You sent them an email complaining about my math, telling them about your stunt.",I didn't know people actually read emails. The delete button is so conveniently loCated--
"We were right that it's a brain issue, but wrong about toxic inhalation and metal poisoning. Everyone else is waiting",That was totally courageous of Khloe to Tweet about her weight gain.
I just killed two birds with one straight. Goodbye.,"Fine, keep playing, but I need you to recommend a good Oncologist because if I don't get one up here in the next few minutes, I got a dead 6-yr-old."
It wasn't sick. Foreman and Cameron freak out quietly It was one kiss for a dying girl. One small! one small kiss before she dies. Thank you. Thanks.,This is exactly why you can't touch my markers. Go see if she's had sex.
-- and my decision to follow public health safety protocols,"Oh, don't blame the rules. Don't hang this on policy and protocol."
Who's that? His wife.,Dominika.
Just enough to spoil your kids? No.,But they need it more than people with TB or Parkldren in Indonesia with no eyes? Diagnosticians with hearts of gold?

Throw in a joke. Vogler leaves.,Dr. Chase. We need to talk.
You're giving her a test.,This whole job is a test.
It's completely cyanotic. This isn't sarcoidosis.,Cholesterol embolization.

"House's department. As House enters, we see Wilson hanging inside a big net, looking angry. --",Got your page.

Unless he didn't know about it. Maybe one of those kids at the camp got tired of Driscoll's lessons and poisoned him.,Go to the camp. Check for potential poisons. The guys leave the room. House stops Masters before she does too.
What are you talking about?,Either she literally has two left feet or you angio-ed the wrong leg.
How does coffee help your leg?,It will prEvent me from walking to get the coffee.
There you go.,Damn.
"If you want to run something through the labs, I get a copy. If you do scans, I get a copy. If you THINK about doing scans, I get a copy.","You know my current thoughts, right? I don't have to put those on paper. Leaves."
She kind of reminds me of someone I know.,Tell me about it. Some of my co-workers will insult people right to their faces. How long have you been this way?

Do you have to tell her it was my fault?,"No. Great part of being a grown-up, you nEver have to do anything."
Hey. The x-ray didn't show any tumors. The acoustical shadow was just a lipoma. House sits down and rubs his leg. I'm thinking you all right?,I'm fine.
Who is this guy?!,I think we just found out.

I didn't expect her to cry for quite so long.,"spotting the waiter as he approaches their table Now, I know that the tiramisu is great here, but I actually ordered off-menu."
It's possible it's not connected to a protest. MS wouldn't show on the CT and his name's Swenson. Scandinavians have an increased susceptibility to MS.,Better theory than he's faking it. The clogs have it. Do a lumbar puncture to confirm MS.
You'd still diagnose hepatic encephalopathy. I know that because four doctors you trained have unanimously diagnosed you with hepatic encephalopathy.,Park's right. Treat the Patient with Heparin.
What are you getting at?,Right now I'm getting at whether or not she had hair down there.
Are you following me? He sits at a table.,Word is you're into monster trucks.
"I think you want me to feel sorry for you and either do the end around on Cuddy or give you the drugs. He takes his pad of prescription slips and puts it away in a drawer under his desk deliberately to make his point. Either way, you get the high you think you need.

You don't treat him he charges you with assault.,Just cause he says I hit him doesn't make it true.

"Oh, come on. I'm not that good-looking.","Yeah, you are."
"While you're waiting, we should run another test with the geology equipment...",You're not taking the cefuroxime.
What day of the week is it? Tuesday.,Better still.
"Look, Dr. House, the only reason that I don't fire you is because your reputation still worth something to this hospital.","Excellent, we have a point of agreement. You aren't going to fire me."
Which brings us to issue three.,"To you, I'm saying you're fired. To Everyone else, I'm..."
"If she can resign, she can un-resign. Go to def-con one. Forget waiting for a mistake, make her make one.","Harm suggests perManent damage. Get her to screw up, then fix it. Oh, and this time, don't tell her what you're going to do before you do it. Leaves."

He'll be dead in two to three days at the most.,"That's unless we can get someone to nail themselves to a cross as soon as possible. Or, stem cell treatment."
I know you're still planning your ridiculous scare test. The Patient is nowhere near sick enough to justify the risk. An angiogram and an E.P. study are much safer and very effective.,Fair point.
Because you were drunk.,What if I saw someone and I followed them on from... Somewhere in Princeton?
Varices. You see it with chronic Hep-C all the time.,entering Biopsy's back. Two findings. Number one lymphocytic infiltrate and no bridging fibrosis.

You left here at 523 p.m. Your motorcycle nEver made it home.,"Well, that covers ten seconds out of the four hours I can't remember. Where else did you look?"
"You, what, found my old yearbook, and got a picture of my high school boyfriend?","Actually, that would have been a lot simpler."
"We can at least observe her for few hours, confirm the rash is spreading.","It spreads, she dies."
"Doctor House, No, then I. What do you think?","Next tried steroid enemas, oral corticosteroids, 5ASAs, 6 mercaptopurine! I'm impressed."

I like sugar now. House sits next to Stacy. They both look bored and somewhat anxious. House keeps tapping his cane on the floor. Some people would be annoyed by that. House taps on the floor a few more times.,You know why people sit in waiting rooms?
gets it He dies on the table and you give her his whole liver.,"If he's gonna do this, he's gonna do this for love. I though he should talk to someone who spoke the language."
I can smell you.,"Yeah, like you're a field of roses. He pushes the emergency buzzer for the nurses. The same two enter. Peppermint tea."
His result for staph Negative. He's not Even a carrier.,"Well, at least Foreman was wrong, too."
You're standing up to me? Maybe.,Just to clarify. You should do that when you're right. Sorry for the confusion. How could a clot!

Where are you going?,To talk to him.
"Because I took a beta blocker! Chase shows him the trick he's been hiding. Both times, right? His platelet count's still low. Chemo's still a death sentence. Treating for Amyloid with normal EKG is like doing heart surgery on a guy because he's ten pounds overweight. It's insane.","Well, we'll do it your way go shout at the Patient till he gets better.

NEver said it was.,exaggerated shivering Brrr! Ice-cold.
Don't patch it up.,"Look! You got screwed over by your own government, and that sucks. But all you're gonna get out of this is a five-day vacation and a band-aid."
Yes and that would make complete sense if there was anything in her environment.,Mimicking Cameron. Just because we haven't found anything yet.
You think it's something they inhaled?,Or licked. Babies are gross.
"Doctor House, You drugged her. What do you think?","Actually, I didn't. I've taken her off all medications."
"No. You don't take Vicodin because you're scared. You take it so you won't feel pain. Everything you've Ever done is to avoid pain drugs, sarcasm! Keeping Everybody at arm's length so no one can hurt you.",As opposed to Everyone else in the world who goes looking for pain like it's buried treasure?

I think he's learned his lesson.,"Oh, I don't know. You'd better check. Jack, is your mommy a big, fat idiot? Jack nods Well, what do you know! I guess you were right."
Maybe it's her heart. What?,It's not a clot. It's a fat embolism. From the amputation.

"Knock it off. He gets up off the seat and approaches House Look, I don't care why Doctor Wilson is doing this, and right now it makes no difference to you either, you need to deal with the reality of your current situation.

So you got two choices - your principles, or your life.",still glaring at Wilson Get out of my office. Tritter shakes his head and Wilson looks disappointed

They give him a point Every time he clears his plate. I've been eating his potatoes.,Will he sell you some minutes?

It means you don't have to make that drive. The pRoblem isn't his marrow. It's his liver.,"Liver failure. Explains Everything. The question is, what explains the liver failure?"
"It's not too bad. I'll-I'll just take one of these... Pours pills from one hand into the other. Vicodin. House grabs the now empty Vicodin bottle out of his pocket. Sticks his hand out to get the pills back, Finn holds his hand over House's and then opens it, but nothing falls out. House rolls his eyes.","You eat a lot of beets, you have an electric toothbrush, and you sleep less than six hours a night."
He told you?,"No, but I don't really care why he didn't. I just need to know how often you go to their House and what you bring."
Of course not. I'd be too nervous couldn't be objective.,Then why are you so anxious to treat Every Patient like they're family? The actual Patient is 16. Here's what happens when doctors care to much.
What if it is? Please kiss me.,Bagels.
What is up with you two?,Wilson lied to the bulls to keep me out of the big House.
"This another pet? Cause it's gonna end badly. Again. Remember we talked about this? At least I talked, and you stared at me eerily. Asofa stares eerily. I think it was eerily. Eerily felt like the best-case scenario.",Hey. Take off your shirt so I can find the rash.

When I was in the hospital they put me on narcotics and suddenly Everything was just better. I didn't feel isolated or lonely. That's where I met my wife. She was so happy. And dumb. And I was... smart... and miserable. You tell me who the genius is. I fell in love with her buzzed out of my head, and I knew I wanted to stay that way forEver.",Enjoy.
No. Literally a witch hunt. Dr. House is a practicing Wiccan. It's a beautiful religion. It's very caring.,"Hey, hey, hey hey! House puts his face into the shot. Very annoyed. You have an all-access pass to the case, not my Fave Five. So go."

I already did. No vegetations. Valves are clear.,Snapilicious!
"breathing heavily It's cruel advice. They were just trying to make sense of what was happening to them, and I'm there telling them not to bother? I should have spent my life being more like you.

"Mobile rings, he picks up. What? When? He puts it down. To be continued.",What are you doing here?

That won't treat for either lymphoma or Takayasu's.,"If it's lymphoma, the ethanol will make him itchy, and Foreman can remove his spleen. If it's Takayasu's, he'll lose his radial pulse, and Chase can start him on steroids."

"Doctor House, The eosinophils were mildly elevated, sed rate's up a bit. Could be looking at a systemic allergic response. What do you think?",It's not allergic. Allergies don't cause cardiac arrest like this. Could be inflammation of the blood vessels.

Something that would cause it to show brain tissue in perfect detail but completely miss neoplastic tissue?,Then they were nEver tumours to begin with.
Think you can pick a lock faster than me?,No need to pick. House shows Foreman a key and uses it to unlock the door
"No, I just wake up really exhausted.",Is something upsetting you?
What'd he say? Three months.,But you haven't told Robert. You don't want to burden him because you were such a lousy dad.

Not usually. Not Ever.,"We know nothing, brain knows all."

Sarcoidosis seems most likely.,"Yeah, so likely that Cuddy's going to think of that all on her own. She's got the kid's whole body to play with. Let her do that test. What's next?"

I haven't spoken to any inmates.,Does anybody do their jobs anymore?
Why not Cuddy? You nEver apologized after you defaced her photo.,Maybe because I recognize that sending someone to the poorHouse is a little more serious than editing a snapshot.
